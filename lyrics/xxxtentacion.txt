I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on 
I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I know you so well 
I mean, I can do better than he can

That's why it's tatted on my face that I'm damn numb
Only tell you 'bout my mind when I'm all alone
That's why I'm never really 'lone in the night time
Change hoes like clothes, I can't get attached
'Cause these hoes fire starters like lit matches
I've been feelin' really lost, duckin' all attachments

Rest in peace to all the kids that lost their lives in the Parkland shooting, this song is dedicated to you
Okay, she keep cryin', she keep cryin' every single night
Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe
Oh no, I swear to God, I be in my mind
Swear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross my—
Said I wanna die, yuh, no, I'm not alright, yuh
I might start a riot, yuh, I'm so fuckin' tired, yuh
So what's up? What you say? Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great
Tired of the fuckin' hate, stackin' cheese all on my plate
So outside my misery, I think I'll find
A way of envisioning a better life
For the rest of us, the rest of us
There's hope for the rest of us, the rest of us
Okay, she keep cryin', she keep cryin' every single night
Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe
Oh no, I swear to God, I be in my mind
Swear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross my—
Said I wanna die, yuh, no, I'm not alright, yuh
I might start a riot, yuh, I'm so fuckin' tired, yuh
So what's up? What you say? Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great
Tired of the fuckin' hate, stackin' cheese all on my plateIt will all be over soon
And I'm always where the
Sun don't shine, the tears don't show
Won't hurt me now 'cause heart's been broke
I hate myself, but it won't show
I constantly lose all my remorse
And it's 10 for the wolf and three for the shepherd
And it's one for the sheep who led by your leopard
Often gave his perception as a handle of weapon
Took a bite of your apple, give me all you can offer
Now I'm trapped in a changing maze, setting my soul ablaze
Couldn't control the pace, where is this going?
Hey, heartless is recklessness, it's word of a pacifist
To word of a masochist, I'm off of the map
My Lord, I spoke to a Baphomet, he said he would save me
If I gave him one thing he needed, "What is this thing?", I pleaded
Boy, it's the key to even
Yeah
And as I spoke, my fangs were shown
Taken aback, he smiles and tells me
"What you crave will soon be yours
But what I crave is already mine"
Anima vestra
Anima
Anima vestra

Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why
Steady tryin' to maintain
Same things that'll blow a bitch mind frame
My brain can't fathom what the hate say
He say, she say, how 'bout me say?
Get the Vis-a, headed to the islands A-S-A-P
What's that on my shawty wrist? That's a AP
I'm the type to save a bitch, C-A-P-E
Feelin' like ET, flyin' out of the Addy
Fuckin' on shawty, she baddie, casual convo then at it
I mean I'm better than better, maybe I'm lyin'
I'm sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain't love?
I'ma find a perfect balance, it's gon' take time
I heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty in love through the grapevine

So come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-ohHow did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you, yeah
High up, you're falling back down
Trapped in a concept, falsely accused
Misused and misled
Bitch, I'm hopin' you fuckin' rest in peace
Now the fact that I'm alone is fuckin' comfortin'
And I can't seem to shake this fuckin' feeling in my…
Uh, cold shoulder, heartbroken, misspoken
I'm cut open, her fingers in all my stab wounds
And if she could, she'd probably dance on my grave
Inside my head, I see your face
I fuckin' hate that I love you still 
Carry on, like flights, I just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, like flights, I just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, like flights, I just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Yeah
How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you, yeah
High up, you're falling back downYou ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
Such is bashful, but niggas like a task force
Mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot, then bring violence
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin', "Fuck it," and grab the pump?
Then kill a woman with many children? Makes you a chump
Look in all the stores you wreckin', nigga, I reckon
Think about the people who own it for 'bout a second
I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair
But sure, you'd rather hear me say, "Fuck the black prejudice
Let's murder different races, grow hatred, and form irrelevant
Views,” and etcetera, knives thrown
Damage 'em, lives blown, oblivion, all cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
Murder opps, killin' shit, I'd enjoy the thrill of it
Bathe in blood of officers, different corpses, offin' 'em
Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em, murder 'em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace but say, "Fuck it," and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin', go 'head and grab the extension
Give death another one, uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of innocence
But in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance
Blasphemous, killin' our own, murderin' black
We see, I see, death before the children
White guys and white girls hanging from the buildings I should've let you know that you're my only one
I know you're feelin' numb, I'll fuck you 'til you cum
Said, "I don't understand how you don't got a man"
You want me in your bed, 'cause I've been in your head
Baby, you've been up all night, so you don't wanna wait on me
I'm aboutta catch my flight, so you don't gotta wait on me
No more, you don't wanna, you don't wanna
You don't wanna, you don't wanna, you don't wanna
You don't wanna, you don't wanna
I've been up a very long time, wonder why they hate on me
I don't wanna love myself, I'm praying that they all love me
'Cause you don't wanna, you don't wanna
You don't wanna, you don't wanna, you don't wanna
You don't wanna, you don't wanna
I should've let you know that you're my only one
I know you're feelin' numb, I'll fuck you 'til you cum
Said, "I don't understand how you don't got a man"
You want me in your bed, 'cause I've been in your head
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, noUp there 
Who do I have?
Heaven and hell, my friend 
I won't shed a tear
Let them see me in pain again
Hello , from the dark side in
Does anybody here wanna be my friend? 
Want it all to end
Tell me when the fuck is it all gon’ end? 
Voices in my head
Telling me I'm gonna end up dead 
So save me , before I fall

So save me , before I fall 
So save me , I don’t wanna go aloneNa, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Depression and obsession don't mix well
I'm poisoned and my body don't feel well
I ate her, inside and out, I feel my stomach turnin'
Make out hill, where we met we let our lips do all the talkin'
And now I'm hooked and…
Depression and obsession don't mix well 
Hollywood motels, hell, I think I'm just obsessed with you

Diamonds on like they cheat codes, ayyThe pain in my heart just won't end
The words that I find just don't seem to compare
Awaiting my death in the end
Alone, I must seek out the end to begin
So nobody wants death
'Cause nobody wants life to end
I'm the only one stressed
And the only one tired of having fake friends
Put the noose on my neck
And the hole in my back, again
I've been waiting on death with a smile on my face
So this is the end
Waste of tears
Waste of years and months
Faced my fears
Loving her for once
Hurt me
Break my heart
Worthless
Can't keep love at all
Turning, twist myself
Worthless
Can't keep love at all, at allI shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should've set it free but I...
Our Father, hallowed be thy Name
I shot an angel with my father's rifle
Thy Kingdom come
I should've set it free but I...
Hush little angel, don't say a word
Bottle full of pills, passed out on the curb
Sun brings heat and it just won't snow
Noose like a necklace on my neck, won't go
I was too slow 'cause I won't understand
Blade for your cries, count a penny for my sins
Water flies off and the lake don't stream
Wrist down the river, not across, wanna bleed
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Wake up to your face
I'm straight-forward, fuck a pace
What I wanted just so happened to be you
Couldn't picture being a moment in your shoes
When I think back to the kidney failures
Broken promise, I failed
I won't deny it, I hailed the ground you walk on
Yeah
Heart stops, you walk away
You're good today, you're gone tomorrow
I carry my heart on my face, I'm so depressed
What good is sex?
I pray that you would love me less
And now it's here, hand on my chest
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stayMamita, vente 
Ma-mi-ta

AwwHey there you, looking for a brighter season 
Need to lay your burden down 
Hey there you, drowning in a helpless feeling 
Buried under deeper ground 
Yeah, okay, uh, uh, yeah
I seem depressed, always being bothered, never less
Keeping me out of prison and putting me to the test
They ask me what is happiness, you write it on a check
Or you feel it on the sweat, when your dick is in the breast, huh

If death is what it seems, why is it so vividly portrayed within my dreams?
The fear of understanding the Devil's running his course
Hatred's not received, it's coming straight from the source
Remorse, as this time becomes a factor, minds full of greed, exposing your benefactors
Backwards, pace backwards, everyone is superficial
Only breaching the surface, surface upon the Earth
And flames engulf the Earth, and prized possessions, they incinerate
This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate
See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight
Perplexed, only receive slumber when at Heaven's gates
And this is fairly simple for your breath, try and contemplate your conversates
Hesitate and navigate your inner traits
Back to a time where minds were just matter
If you stated opinions then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then cause there was no reacting, acting up
Chevy in black, Acura
Accurate facts put the black in fact
If you thought that you are free, you should disregard that
All facts

Found this sound in Sweden, a while ago
It's like, the more I explore this song, the more-
I explore different sounds, period
It's like the more I fall in love with making music
It's nice, actually
I'm out my mind, see fear in your eyes
I'm sick, I despise myself again
The tears never come, my body is numb
I feel like a god amongst the men
Cut out my eyes, feed me with lies
That I don't never have to see again
I feed the hate, I feed the truth
I give the pain to the youth
Fuck the devil for your wealth
Pistol chilling on my shelf

Members Only Volume 2, vrotherAnd hell is just a government creation
And all the information they solicit isn't nearly close to truth
It was clear since the alteration
Of the books our children study when they said Columbus discovered America, oh, the ultimatum
Of telling you the truth but oh well I'm already in hell
I'm tired of havin' patience
So I'ma sell my soul and say some shit that fuckin' bothers you
Jesus wasn't white nor black, I can't knock it
Was somewhat a Arab and one hell of a prophet
Don't understand why J. Cole talkin' 'bout false prophets
But didn't mention higher-ups
Change your name to Amber Cole
These fucking entertainers is playing it by the rules
Sucking government dick for safety to stay cool
I'm absolutely disgusted by all of you motherfuckers

Listen close, what is this?
Is it heartbreak?
Is it truly what it feels like?
What it sound like?
What is truly at the essence?
Sharp teeth in the chest
Cancer all in the breast
Of the beaten and bruised
Feelin' like a pawn to the greed of these fools
But I never been a piece of the evil
In the womb of these fake fuck niggas
With they masks up, presume
I'll be telling, if I got a load, I swear I resume
On my conquest
For the key to the chest where my mind slept
And the love in my heart is a cancer
And I spread it through the wall as an answer
To the cries of the dead and the vanquished
The depressed and the lost and the damned, it's
Preservation of the peace, an ideal world
Never lonely when you flowin' through my mind, girl
I apologize, 'cause I couldn't see the pain in your damn eyes
'Cause a nigga made you leave with your heart in between different pains
Couldn't see ya when ya ain't cry
I guess I'm at a loss for words
To feel so close to someone, and for them to be gone the next day
I guess you never realize how permanently damaging that isDead inside
Spend a lot of time stuck in this head, of mine
Under the assumption love is dead, already
Just let me be here
Where was I?

20/20 vision, still not fuckin' with it
Every move I make, I do with precision
Everybody tryna get on a song
But what is the purpose when I'm not the feature?
Whoa, tryna be the G.O.A.T. but I just see them walkin' by my door
Make the country proud, I got the governor wearin' all my clothesI remember I had walked home that day
Content with all my misery
Told myself it'd get better, no clue what there was next for me
Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance
I was dressed for winter weather
But the summer rays were kissing me, I—
I was lost
So I took a different path
In the distance he awaited me
Had no weapon, I'm guessin' his hands were just enough for me
Was no question, I'm guessin' he laughed just at the sight of me
I was lost
I remember I had walked home that day
Content with all my misery
Told myself it'd get better, no clue what there was next for me
Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance
I was dressed for winter weather
But the summer rays were kissing me, I—
I was lost
And there he was, his presence was alarming
As he approached, was casual, we talked 'bout self-harming
He told me, "Kid, you shouldn't be walkin' on your own"
He smiled and laughed, and pat my back
He asked, "How far are you from home?"
I said, "Maybe 30 minutes"
His frequency distorted quick, I seen it in his image
I should've run right fucking there, a—
You ever woke up on a train track, with no motherfuckin' clothes on?
Death before your eyes, you prayin' to God, but ain't no response
Tryna scream for hope, just a shoulder that you can lean on
But ain't nobody comin', so you scream on and scream on and scream on
While this evil fuck laugh at you
Train getting closer, you still surprised that he battered you
Tears falling harder and harder, minutes get minuscule
Could've had a son or a daughter, now what you finna do?
You finna die here on this train track
'Cause clearly after death, ain't no way you can find your way back
Thinking 'bout your previous memories, going way back
All them fucking dreams 'bout a diamond chain and a Maybach
Now your time finally up
Ask yourself this final question, is you going down or up?
Recollectin' all the moments that you never gave a fuck
Now it's here, death has now arrived, time's finally upAs a fair warning to everyone listening to this song
I advise you to not hide your feelings
Don't pretend to be okay when you're not okay
Don't pretend to be happy when you're sad
It'll only lead to your misery
Don't you fucking hate it when you hear my name?
I feel the same and when you hear this you gon' feel the pain
And all these niggas that you fuckin' with to get away
But girl, I know you think about it almost every day
And I'll be honest, I be jealous of these niggas, true
How you feelin' with these niggas that you talk to?
Captivated by your mind and your walk, too
Can't replace you with these bitches that I talk to
This ain't lust, it's love, we had trust, what's good?
I should've held you close, should've kept you warm
And when the rain is fallin', wonder who you call
Don't pray to God, you'd rather cry than call
Don't jump, pretend it don't hurt, repent, I won't stomp
My feet in a rage, my nigga, I'm no chump
Need you and I crave you, hate you
Think I ripped the wings off of my fuckin' angel
Don't hurt me, damn
W.R.A.C
I'll forever be the
I'll forever be the elephant in the room
I'll always love you
I'm sorry I can't seem to find someone's shoulder
Who will I rely on when it's over?
Took a chance with you, it made me colder
Better on my own when it's all over
So when I'm weak, who do I call?
My God, it hurts, I can't be calm
What do I do? Where do I run?
I'm tired of hate, I'm tired of love
I dug my nails into my arms
She turned and laughed at all my scars
What is my worth?
What is my worth?
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet

So, again, I want to thank everybody for being here, in particular, I want to thank—

And the future of many youth, if I play my cards can advance, and-
Genuine dime, I opened my mind, and where can I find this future?
Sever your mind or you will be blind, and trapped in a mind of lies within our walls
I'm feelin' like my mind within a war between myself
Between this slavery of media, it's poor presentation
The youth within our nation
Such is a pity, dependin' on people resemblin' Bible Satan, uh
Set 'em up off and wet 'em up off like it's PlayStation, uh
Open up your minds and come together as a nation, why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
This has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America.  What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.  No citizen should ever fear for their safety and security in our society.  And no child should ever be afraid to go outside and playI was like whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-woah-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Won't look back on my mind
Won't let bad out my shine
Won't let you cloud my mind
Won't let you cloud my mind
All my days, I was cryin'
All my lows, all my highs
Told my Mom, "I'm gon' shine"
Told my love, "I'm gon'-"
And I was like
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

And I was like
Whoa-oh-oh

Pull up on the next bitch

Please open your legs, bitch

But I could be your daddy, bitch
Got big legs like a caddy, bitch
Really wanna fuck, send the addy, bitch

Real bad bitch with a attitude

Really mad a nigga was cuffin' you
Really make a nigga uncomfortable, hey
So where we go as we walk this lonely road?

So where we go as we walk this lonely road?
So where we go?
So where we go as we walk this lonely road?
So where we go?So much hate at the top, it's a lonely place
When you find out the opps ain't the only snakes
And your spouse only know what you don't erase
The world only know you by your worst mistakes
So spaz on they ass, that's the only way
Smash on the gas down Stony, ayy
Crash and come back with a swollen face
And when I'm on my way, X hold the gate
Terrorize shit, we don't negotiate
If you bitch-made, we don't associate
Show up at your birthday if you owe me cake
With a black mask, that's how we exfoliate
So pardon my way, my heart's in the way
I follow my thoughts, ain't no logic in Ye
Said that's all I'ma say, if he caught him a case
Then send him to jail, like a dog in a cage
I ain't feeling the age, no rottin' away
You're dark as the days, you caught in the way
'Cause coffins is laid under a tombstone
'Cause even when you die, they still throwin' rocks at your graves
So follow the wave, can't swallow the hate
My mind trumps anything that a scholar could say
Don't know how to behave, we rage out of the raves
Dislocate an arm, just pop it in place
'Cause the damned, they ain't it, all the pain and anguish
Turned me into a man, so I ain't complainin'
Now these things is changin', no more lames is hanging
No more fame in famous, ain't no shame in shamin'
She wanna give you the cookie, you Famous Amos
She gave you the pussy, but you ain't pay for the anus
Now your name is tainted, by the claims they paintin'
The defendant is guilty, no one blames the plaintiff
Gotta say it in Layman's terms, while you wait on arraignments
'Cause if the jury say you did it, the payment is heinous
Give me one minute, my lady just fainted
My babies is crying, you understand what I'm sayin'?
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute and the next one's... mine!
Ahaha
Faith, I want more
Faith, I want more
Faith, I want more
Faith, I want more
Faith, I want more
Faith, I want more!
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and then the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute and the next one's—I put one in that chamber, lay you in the face of God
Know to be-face the fake fuck, aight
Fuck is a feelin' God, level I'm, feelin' odd
Fairily Beverly Hill, Westside
Bitch, I'm drillin' your neighbor daughter at Best Buy
If I hit up your jack, then nigga, you best slide
If you totin' that pistol, nigga, you best ride

Trippin', you catch a clip, bitchin you not equipped with that
Pussy boy, don’t be talkin' shit

"Beauty and the Beast" with the clip, be cautious
Caution,  I murder the pussy, I’m steady flossin'
Aw shit, I leave ‘em corpses, I metamorphose
I’m fancy, lodge your head in the window of Porsches
Call less, in intercourse, then got an abortion
Slide in the pussy with Ritalin and abort it
Laughin', I leave the masses straight gaspin'
Caskets, preachin' a murder, so light your matches
Nasty tone with a nasty poem
Pretty kitty, dirty vagabond
Tragic, sacrificing sanity for vastness
Belittling vanity, watch that nigga when we cast it
Half-wet, I leave him half-alive in the basket
And if you not a savage, succumb to the madness

Bad Vibes Forever
ItWillAllBeOverSoon
I see black skies, and white lies, I'd rather be
Dead, filling my head with different enemies
Thoughts consuming me, fueling my insecurities
As the ground right under me crumbles as if it wasn't there
It's too much, my heart's crushed, I'm not alive
I won't allow myself happiness 'cause it's all lies
I've seen the pain, I've run away so many times
Death and I are companions, it's here at all times
I won't love, won't trust, I won't die
I can't feel, but managed to steal your heart, love
Was dirt poor, now fuck whores and want love
It seems that anything offered could be enough, but
As time, body falls, so I don't know who to call
Alone and my heart, got tat' of it broke
I'm so fucking numb, my life has succumbed
To hatred and death alone in the snowHeart eater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Heart eater, try but you will not suffice
Heart eater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?
Heart eater, try but you will not suffice

Heart eater, why'd you eat my heart alive?
Still breathing, why you looking so surprised?

I... I didn't remember much

It definitely stood out
I remember her smell and her touch
The way she used to talk to me
It all hurts so much now
How could I waste so much time on someone who doesn't even love me?
And even all the time I spent, it's all pointless
Now I feel like I don't even wanna live anymore

And where did you go as I slept? 
I can't seem to get out my head 
I wept and I'll count the tears I shed 
She sat there and watched as I bled
As I bled, as I bled, as I bled
As I bled, as I bled, as I bled
And where did you go as I slept? 
I can't seem to get out my head 
And where did you go as I slept? 
I can't seem to get out my head Yeah
There she was with the blade in her hand
Scars on her skin replaced kiss of the man
She's played a part for as long as she's known
Regret fills her heart as her love leaves her home
She's learned to be passive, but such is a loss
Accepting defeat when I foreclose the costs
For her, this was needed to be rid of the pain
You play the victim and I'll play insane
Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists 'til my heartbeat is silent
With the shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots in her body 'til she is a stump
Stomp out the fucker, his death will be slow
You made me do this just as far as you know
If you don't exist then my pain can be rid
So I gut the fucker then eat like a pig
Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists 'til my heartbeat is silent
With the shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots in her body 'til she is a stump
Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists 'til my heartbeat is silent
With the shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots in her body 'til she is a stump
I am the heart marksmanGot it on smash

If I'm Superman, she my Lois Lane
Gucci everything, Louis everything
Had to cut her off, she sniff too much 'caine
Don't look so surprised, all she want to do is lie
Then she turned around and cried, demons all in her eyes
She don't feel no pain, she might be insane
Colder than some rain, pussy lemonade
Foreign Spanish jawn, really like the lemonade

A collection of nightmares, thoughts, and real-life situations I've lived. 17 is the number tattooed on the right side of my head, my own personal number, soon to be explained in future interviews or instances. By listening to this album, you are literally, and I cannot stress this enough, literally entering my mind. And if you are not willing to accept my emotion and hear my words fully, do not listen. I do not value your money; I value your acceptance and loyalty. Here is my pain and thoughts put into words. I put my all into this in the hopes that it will help cure, or at least numb your depression. I love you. Thank you for listening. Enjoy.I drink blood of school shooters

Bulletproof vest upon his chest to get revenge back
Black Richie Rich gon' hold the clip until the feds pop

Part 2: RIOT
Luke White on the beat
You ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
Such is bashful, but niggas like the task force
Mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot and bring violence
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin' fuck it and grab the pump?
Then kill a woman of many children makes you a chump
Look at all the stores you wreckin', nigga I reckon
Think about the people who own it for about a second
I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair
But yo, you'd rather hear me say, "Fuck black prejudice!"
"Let's murder different races, grow hatred and form irrelevant!"
Views and etcetera, knives thrown
Damage 'em, lives blown, oblivion hole cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
Murder ops, killin' shit, I'd enjoy the thrill of it
Bath in blood of officers', different corpses, offin' 'em, Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em
Murder 'em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace but say "fuck it" and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin'
Go ahead and grab the extension
Grab another one: uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of the innocence
But in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance
Blasphemous, killin' our own, murderin' black—
Equity and equality: the end result we all — the ones that don't want to live in misery, that is — desire.  And naturally we all black and white are schadenfreude or malicious. Here are a few examples
Emmett Till, August 28th, 1955, Mississippi — pulled out of his house in the middle of the night, in front of his mother who had to watch her son be taken from her on the sidelines, for little to no reason at all worth murdering a fourteen-year-old boy.  Castrated, mutilated, but also documented for the years to see
Kori Ali Muhammad, black-on-white. Philando Castile, white-on-black.  Now these things never come to or remotely remain in the public eye. And the youth is never inspired to take a stand to make a difference. So I will speak for them. The youth, that is, the ones full of innocence. The ones inspired by the things around them, to matter
I can go on forever about the fact that murder is murder whether you're black or white. You should always feel free to voice your opinion, but to act out on these irrational thoughts in every shape or form is disgusting. You cannot, as black or white, call yourself the supreme race when moved out of your comfort by the opposition's color, their skin color.  That is no form of being or demonstrating being a supreme being
If you are a supremacist, be unmoved by the opposition. Remain unscathed in the comfort of your own home, in your own realm. Demonstrate care for the youth's future, white or black, black or white. Are you willing to risk your child's future due to your own bigotry? The choice is yours, but your child will not stand for the hate. This generation will be loved, nurtured, heard and understoodBy my window
Broken glass
No one here knows
My intent
In the end
I won't cry, I won't falter
In the end
I won't run, I won't hide
It's too late
I won't stand by the altar
In the end
I won't run, I won't hideOh, oh
I won't let it control me
I won't let it control me
The memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turnin' around
And I won't let her control me
No, I won't let her control me
The memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turnin' around
And I won't let her control me
No, I won't let her control me
Now I'm just a ghost in my own life
So make the most of this goodbye
Do you still dream about me late at night
Or are you out there livin' better times?
You know it's killin' me to let go
I see your face, but it's someone I don't know
Everything was perfect just an hour ago
Will you remember me tomorrow?
And memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turnin' around
I won't let it control me
I won't let it control me
And memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turnin' around
I won't let it control me
Oh, I won't let it control meYuh

Oh, fuck
Ayy, pipe up, man, turn up, turn upHello, you've come here in search of release, huh? Feeling the need to inspire your soul? Wanting to disappear to a place you could feel outside of your skin? Well, you've found one: a place within my mind.The way I feel now, just can't compare
To where we left off, to where, to where, to where, to where
I said, the way I feel now, just can't compare
To where we left off, to where, to where, to where, to where
Regret, I quit this fucking indecision!

Alright, I'm coming up
Any nigga that doubted me, I'm coming up
Any hctib that looked down on me, I'm coming up
I stand out, I do my tihs
I'm always been on my tihs

Ow, eh eh
Jah, Jah yutes dem rising
Rising, rising
Eh eh
Den gon dem fallin', fallin', fallin'
He showin' signs of corruption
Then went from somethin' to nothin'
He put his hands on his mother
And now he's fuckin' his cousin
Now she's havin' his baby
The bitch is driving him crazy
The motherfucker was violent
'Cause he was fresh out the Navy
She dealt with constant abuse
Never revealing the truth
She kept the feelings concealed
Until they rose to the roof
A war starts, heart drop, 'cause she was tied to the bed
Just as she thought it was over, he put a gun to her head
But listen
All my life, I dreamed these things
Seems surreal that I see these things
Until I D-I-E, all you niggas just P-I-E
Nah nigga can't sleep on me, ah ah
But listen
All my life, I dreamed these things
Seems surreal that I see these things
Until I D-I-E, all you niggas just P-I-E
Nah nigga can't sleep on me
Sleep with a knife by your bed
So convinced she got a gun to her head
Only relief is when she's taking the meds
Or taking Henny instead
Taking liquor to her belly in bed
Until her belly is red
Now she's findin' out the baby is dead
She don't wanna live this life no more
But she's stuck because she got no cure
And she want more
She don't wanna live this life no more
But she's stuck because she got no cure
And she want more
Eh eh, Jah, Jah yutes dem rising
Rising, rising
Eh eh
Den gon dem fallin', fallin', fallin'
About a quarter to noon
He started roaming these streets
Left her tied back home
Her mouth was covered with sheets
He started making observations from starting up conversations
Pill pop, left himself with no options
'Cause his mind is made and he keeps counting his days
Rather than smoking, the nigga simply going insane
Tying himself to a bridge as it began to occur
Fucker couldn't breathe, his sight had even went to a blur
Guess it's the drugs that made the nigga absurd
Thin-thin-thinking 'bout the past and all the things that he learned
But then it came to a turn
Started thinking evil thoughts in the burn
Ran for years and now the thought has retur—

My flesh is cold, I held a ghost
My flesh is cold, I held a ghost
My flesh is cold, I held a ghost 
I've held a ghost
And I, could've been
Next fall, next blade in the king
Bleed red, four doors in the Benz
But I met four ghosts in the pen
And it slipped through my fingertips
And I, could've been
I've lost all hope
Dead, boy, my soul is amiss
Flushed skin, X types of a kiss
Rather hate, bitch
I want nothing to do with this
Just face the abyss, and I 
Place blame for this shit 
Rather be dead, dull blades on my wrist, wrist
Fucking with my head, get dead, that's the gist
Flushed, you can see it on me, I'm pissed, pissed
Lost in the mist , pants full of piss 
Pick a daffodilly, so pretty at this
Fist fuck, started feeling, silly willy, take a look
At the rope, then he jumped
All he needed was a brick, brick
Daisy, those are making Fugazi
If we don't leave
Lost, I pick up a case and
Close it, close it, pick up the rabies 
We will burn with this town
Daisy, those are making Fugazi
Lost, I pick up a case and
Close it, close it, pick up the rabies 
Living a farce
If everything was everything
Living a farce, living a farce
Living a farce
I would never have to worry about anything
Living a farce, living a farce
I've held a ghost
And it slipped through my fingertipsTo find, to find the exact words, to find the perfect words, to say less, but to say more, was ideal with this project, and 'til my energy and mind be felt, in a less aggressive way, but a more passive and genius way was ideal with this album, to show the versatility and to show the open- to open minds in itself was the goal of this album, and to acquire a large amount of passion, and love and appreciation for myself was the goal of this album; loyalty to myself was the goal of this album. So, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions; if you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind. If you don't listen to the alternative sound and you've never been into the alternative sound and have not been open to trying different things; open your mind before you listen to this album. You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, your car, but it can be played anywhere. This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last. It's something you can find comfort in, it's very comforting, but discomforting at the same time. So, with this project, again, you're entering my mind, feeling my insanity, feeling my, my genius, my energy. Enjoy'Tention , 'tention

The wind blows through the window
At the house of a dead man
All alone, in limbo holdin' onto a cold hand
Missin' a part of me, I know I need to shut my eyes again
I know it's hard to be the only one alone inside your head
Missin' a part of me, I know I need to shut my eyes again
I know it's hard to be the only one alone
The wind blows through the window at the house of a dead man
All alone, in limbo, holdin' onto a cold hand
The wind blows through the window at the house of a dead man
All alone, in limbo, holdin' onto a cold hand
Drownin' in all my regrets
All just the same in the end
Over and over again 
All that we do is pretend 
Drownin' in all my regrets
All just the same in the end 
Over and over again
All that we do is pretend
Lay me down, I'll start again
You're not around, I can't pretend
That I won't drown, that life won't end
I'm bleedin' out, I lost a friend
Lay me down, I'll start again 
You're not around, I can't pretend 
That I won't drown, that life won't end

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
All alone, in limbo, holdin' onto a cold hand
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oohI thought you got all you came for
Lover, lover
Kicking up doubt when it's sore
It's going to be covered in dark
You came all this way for a door, watching others break it down
Now I see what you came for, lover
All or nothing aren't the same score
Thought I lost my mind
With the pastor preachin', or the picture paintin'
With a heart embracin'
Ever since, from the Southside
Sorted out in a archive, for the black price, suitcase and a black tie
How profound, I find it funny
No explainin' how I lost my self
But I'm chillin' in the bookshelf
With a pocket knife, slit your wrist with your act to right
Such is life
Ecstacy, slit wrist, and a vagabond
Vagabond, vagabond, you're my ecstasy
Ah-ah
Are you tasting me?
But I miss you and I hate you
Ah-ah
But I need you, and I love you more
Every minute
Ah-ah
In January, and December, I want you
Ah-ah
You're my ecstasy
Shut it down, going to take you outside 
Sifting up a reason from the lonely dirt 
When it’s over, you’ll be golden 
Over, over 
Shut it down, going to take you outside 
Sucking up the dust from your static crown 
Oh, just to turn away, and you'll be golden 
Over, over 
I think you got all you came for
But do you want more?
Easy is overdone, overdone
Is it gonna be right this time?
Is it gonna be golden?
Is it gonna be right this time? 
Push drugs in my pocket
I'ma pull it out and then pop it
I'm a common case of a ganja blaze
And my mind is fading quite frankly 
It's a tricky course, never that way
Give my mind a question
What kind of sorcery is this?
Dark night and a night eclipse
Lacy, Lacy, Lacy
One more request
Release my pain 
Did you think you got all that you came for?
Lover, lover
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia
I think you got all you came for
But do you want more?
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia

Different person when she texting, guess her heart was hurting
She need attention I'm guessing I didn't get the message
She told me "Bae, I know you miss me, why you still pretending?"
Louis loafers, Fendi, and different colors matching
She leave her house like she winning a fucking beauty pageant
And when she older, she told me she wanted to be an actress
Keep that spray in that condo in case a nigga actin'
She got some issues she told me her daddy beat her 50
And she tried to do stripping but I guess it wasn't fittin'
Now she fucks with these fuckers, she just want the dollar bills

Two shots for me and fuckin' Jesus himself
Who the fuck signed the petition giving Jesus the belt?
Tie it around his neck and get to fucking bucklin' up
For every moment I counted on him, I'm fuckin' him up
Torture victims are due to scriptures, it's written and such
So every moment my uncle suffered was planned in the cut
Cut his tongue out and hammered fuckin' nails in his skull
Couldn't see what Jesus planned, my vision is dull, and so
If there's a fucking ***, I wanna slit his fucking throat
And feed his organs to the children
And shower solutions to the black and the white
And endless indulgence to the youth in the night
Cult scripture, we're all used to be causin' a ruck
Drownin' women and many children and pillaging trust
Just the minimum, murdered many in sake of himself
He just replaced you, you are just a book on his shelf
Slow dancin' with the devil in a burnin' room
Two-steppin' ahead until they lock me in a tomb
Been doomed since they pulled us out the womb
Satan preyin' on me, she been throwin' souls inside the wombs
Life shouldn't eat you up, spit you out, beat you up
But, bitch, the third eye stay open, don't think I blink enough
Maybe I see too much, baby, I can't call it
I need my soul in these bars like a alcoholic
I can't trust nobody
I'll put that on my mind, soul, and my whole body
I see demons, and there's nothin' they don't know about me
No matter how much I try to hide, they gon' find me
So now I never run from it 'cause I come from it
I never lied, I resides in the beast's stomach
I looked the Devil in the eyes, I could see she bluffin'
I pull the red dress to the side, tell her keep cummin', keep cummin'
I just found out family and enemies could be different
I was steppin' over syringes that's in my kitchen
After mama died, I couldn't go to the bathroom
Without gettin' some second-hand heroin high while pissin'
This is just me paintin' a picture of what I live with
What you know about comin' home to your shit missin'
And findin' out the niggas that helped you look for it had did it?
This is just me paintin' addiction
These niggas took methamphetamine, ketamine, edibles, and a bean
Niggas stole my denim jeans, Den of Thieves DVD, literally anything
Food I bought from the vending machine
Credit card crack any door like janitor keys
Niggas even took credit for the man I would be 
And if I let him, he would probably take twenty percent, manager fee
I'm so scared of my genes, I considered celibacy
Afraid I would ruin my seeds, like Adam and Eve
I got blood on the fuckin' leaves of my family tree
Just give me one damn minute, this shit is hard for me
I lost my whole damn mama, I lost a part of me
She lost her whole damn life from symptoms of poverty
Grew up with Crown Fried Chicken cloggin' my arteries
Increase in robberies, police and bullets that I bob and weave
It was nonstop for me, no one is stoppin' me
Either fulfill myself or be a self-fulfillin' prophecy
This just how I introduce myself properly
KembaWhat are you doing out in the middle of this field leaving your car?
I'm just not sure what he's thinking
He's getting back into his car, he's grabbed his bag
And from our vantage there's no one around him
You know, you wait for these things to end, but then you figure how it might wind up
He's completely alone
This is really starting to worry me, I gotta tell ya
I gotta tell ya
I been speakin' to the reaper, seein' spirits when I'm sleepin'
I been creepin' with them demons, shadows walk through the flames
Sippin' blood with the leeches, fuck the god you believe in
When I look in the mirror, all I see is disgrace
All of this rage, feelin' my face
Blood on the end of my blade
Can't complain, everything okay
Scars on my heart from feelin' this pain
Got a knife in my back, can't kill me though
Numb to it all, my feelings froze
Pray to the sky, Lord, give me hope
Bitch, I'm born alone and die alone, mmh
K holes in my halo, slave for the peso
Middle finger, fuck that
Land of the free, feed can to the teens
Never trust police, bitch, I bust back
Fuck the government, never trust that
All the people wanna know where the love's at
We already know where the fuckin' drugs at
Where the guns at, get your scope, blatt
Yeah, hey
Hey
I was in her house with some glass shards
Breaking out the back door 
I'm a bear, she try claw 
Then I broke her backbone 
Wild, heard her dad call
Pushed me on the damn floor
Told me put my pants on
I was thinkin' a lot of things, by any means
I'll kill this bitch nigga if he try to take me from the fuckin' girl of my dreams
I'll kill first
Put his ass in the dirt
Body bag 'cause he worth somethin' that hurts
And he won't be the firstScorchin', you know what I mean? 
Yeah 
Ooh 
Ooh 
What you say, what you say

Two shots for me and fucking Jesus himself
Who the fuck signed the petition giving Jesus the belt?
Tie it around his neck and get to fucking buckling up
For every moment I counted on him, I'm fucking him up
Torture victims are due to scriptures, it's written as such
So every moment my uncle suffered was planned in the cut
Cut his tongue out and hammered fucking nails in his skull
Couldn't see what Jesus planned, my vision is dull, and so
If there's a fucking God, I wanna slit his fucking throat
And feed his organs to the children
And, shower solutions to the black and the white
And, endless indulgence to the youth in the night
Cold scripture all use to be causing a rut
Drowning women and many children and pillaging trust
Just the minimum, murdered many in sake of themself
He just replaced you, you are just a book on his shelf, and so
Who the fuck is God?
Who the fuck is God?
I said, who the fuck is God?
Is he a trap star or rockstar
Or the president
Doesn't leave many men, innocent 
Yeah, see, living for a reason I don't know
Fuck Jehova
It's Sully the Chief God
Hold up, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Society is a parasite that darkens the soul
Keeping us ignorant and under control
Our heart's growing colder as our ego takes over
Drugs numb the pain that I carry on my shoulder
Smoking all this weed hoping that God forgives me
While I stand and refuse to bow down on my knees
Bow down on my knees
Fuck that, smoke that DMT
You never seen the shit I seen
Pullin' up in beams smoke by the steam
Once had hood dreams all about the cream
Then you with the team, servin' up the fiends
Poppy and a spleen, don't fuck with it
Now let me take you back to the story, that I once told
Ayy, ayy, that I once toldDon't come close, don't come close
You don't even know me, you think you know me 
Oh oh, don't come close
Ice under my heels, I hear it breaking
Under my heels, I hear it cracking
Foolish of me to think I had it 
Emmanuel, how foolish of me
To think I had it... 
I hear your voice behind me 
Moving up my neck
I he-hear you talking
Creeping up my shoulder, breathe-breathing
In my head, I hear you screaming 
Just do it
Ye-yeah yeah, I hear you talking
Ye-yeah yeah, feel you moving
Yeah Yeah, Let's do it,  yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Don't come close, don't come close
You don't even know me, you think you know me
Crucifixion, crack rock love, feeding my addiction
Pessimistic, feed her all the lies, and get self-infliction
Blood stains in my gold plates, without a soul, impure hate
Insecure ay, couldn't love another at the same time
Ice cold, see my lover through the grapevine 
History, mystery, hate her, fuck him
What's meant to me? Was it pure green?
But this ice can't melt , Ice Hotel
Chances, chances, chances
Chances
Chances, chances, chances
Chances
Chances, chances, chances
Ice, ice, ice
Chances
Chances, chances, chances
Ice, ice, ice
Ice
Ice, ice, ice
Feel the love in the air
Hate what consumes from rates of the air
Hopped off, legislate for eight
Seven virgins
Swerve and converge
Her rapes lurking, curtain
Covered sins soon rest unwritten

Audemar, huhWhere were you again?
Somewhere with a friend
While I was in my head
I'm lost again, again
She turned around and said
That I was like the rest
That I don't understand the way it is, to her
Where were you again?
Where were you again?
Where were you again?
Where were you again?
Where were you again?
Somewhere with a friend
While I was in my head
I'm lost again, again
She turned around and said
That I was like the rest
That I don't understand the way it is, to her
Where were you again?
Where were you again?
Where were you again?
Where were you again?You can take some of your lyrics as, you know, you'll understand when I'm dead. I mean, these disturbed kids can take these lyrics and say, "You know when I'm dead, everybody's going to know me."
Well, I think that's a very valid point, and I think that, um... that's a reflection of a— not necessarily this program, but of television in general. If you die and enough people are watching, then you become a martyr, you become a hero, you become well-known.  So when you have things like Columbine and you have these kids that are angry and they have something to say and no one's listening, the media sends a message that if you do something loud enough and it gets our attention, then you will be famous for it. Those kids ended up on the cover of Time Magazine, the media gave them exactly what they wanted
I'm that nigga, man
He don't want no one-on-one 
He grab that gun
Equipped with the clip, my son
What happened to a fist fight?
Really with the shit
If a nigga pull up on me
Might shoot a nigga dick right off

So why they lock my Aunty son up?
Might storm the fucking station with my motherfucking gun up
All accusations what they sum up
They locking niggas over young bitches wanting a nut bust
She popped that pussy, she was 15
If she can open up her legs, then she old enough to get dick, see
Because her parents want to flip see
They flipped the script got a nigga locked up
Some bitch shit

The brains will start to abandon their religions
And believe in themselves
And then the world order will start
Yeah, I behead a motherfucker for his contacts

My eyes are blacker than the bottom of the sea
Yuh, narcissistic insufficient 
Dead weight, I've been searching 
Lack of coexistin', just don't see them work with other bitches 
That's when, black and white
When dark at night, that's when I do my searching

*Laughter*
*Snort*
Pick litter the middle of six niggers is bitter
As dick lickers as licking the clits, clitoris
Vigorous black bags like the vividus black Casper
Who’s backing the bash faster than Beverly
Mean cash or with Cassidy
And the passenger packin’ the shovel
Rackin’ up bodies, quicker than calories salaries
Mean spend it and vend it a pussy magnet and stagnant
And fra- fragments of faggots
Whose clique blackin' with cactuses
And the package delivered
For fuckin' sending 'em cinnamon covered synonyms
Get' 'em, got 'em
Killin’ 'em, killable fuckin liberal kidabble
Little fucker then suck a cunt and couple of chemotherapy
Offices, officer
Of accomplishing condiments
Any converse is commonly
Incompetent prominence
Get a communist but-
They never understand
How it feels to be a man
How it feels to be a man, hm
Rolling blunts dump the guts inside a livid pool
We gonna cop a pound of weed and a pound of shrooms
Psych-Psych- Psychedelic man now if you turn on times
I read my story line, never did indulge a crime
Never did I leave a hundred questions in my head
Shit, nigga later, we dead
Paranormal pair of friends sayin’ fuck the world we live
Fuck, fuck the world we live in
Fuck what I don’t represent
Uh, slump, slump
Yeah, slump
Bitch
Same old me but a youngin got his cash up
Now I’m on the come up now these biters playing catch up-
Not talking about tomatoes
Play in my money like its play dough
Never with that girl you claim, my nigga is you gay though?
They say I couldn’t rap, came back like receipts
You can meet me at the Lick or you can meet me at the crib
We can fuck up in the car or we can fuck up in the sheets
Any once I am meeting you in that pussy like a meet and greet
Livin’ out my life courses
Take your bitch to eat, dining with five courses
Everything five stars, white bitches off bars
Man's on Mars, but I’m godly where I’m fromYeah
Fuck off
Bitch, shut up!
Tempo changed, trapped in the rain
Slide on my sidekick, rustin' away
I been feeling lost in the dirt, I stray
Running from the man with the blade, I say
Look in the mirror, does it feel any better?
Magazine covers see my mama had better
Treatments cease and it don't fuckin' matter
Big foot, big foot, stomp, damn, bones shatter
Feeling like Vader, wrist dimensions
Skinny white bitches always geeked in my mansion
Push your fucking mouth on the curb, shove him in it
Bitch tryna have me suicidal, Sean Kingston
NASCAR cap put a strap to his back
Brass knuckles on my hand so I can't call back
Feeling like ming, billionaire boy brat
Fuck a gun, grab a blade and your throat cut back
Captain Morgan, bitch, I'm gorgeous 
Fish scale, bitch, I got bail 
Captain Morgan, bitch, I'm gorgeous 
Fish scale, bitch, I got bail 
Bitch, I got bail, yuh

Okay, okayPay attention to what you're doing in your life ‘cause your life is right in front of you, everything you need is right in front of you. Even if you're broke, even if you're broke, dead broke, it's because it's supposed to be like that and everything – the people who struggle the most or get it the hardest will succeed in the end, I promise you. You will not have the hardest life forever. Everything will come to you, what you deserve will come to you. And if I end up getting shot and killed for what the fuck I'm doing, or if I end up getting my ass beat at some point in time, or, or, nigga, if shit get hard on me, it's 'cause I deserve it. That's point-blank-period. Everybody will get a death that's – everybody will get a death that is deserving, everybody will get a life that is deserving, everybody – you will get what the fuck you deserve.

Lover, lover
Kicking up doubt when it's sore
Going to be covered in dark
You came all this way for a door, watching others break it down
Now I see what you came for, lover
All or nothing aren't the same score
Thought I lost my mind
With the pastor preachin', or the picture paintin'
With a heart embracin'
Ever since, from the Southside
Sorted out in a archive, for the black price, suitcase and a black tie
How profound, I find it funny
No explainin' how I lost my self
But I'm chillin' in the bookshelf
With a pocket knife, slit your wrist with your act to right
Such is life
Ecstacy, slit wrist, and a vagabond
Vagabond, vagabond, you're my ecstasy
Oh-ho
Are you tasting me?
But I miss you and I hate you
Oh-ho
But I need you and I love you more
Every minute
Oh-ho
In January and December, I want you
Oh-ho
You're my ecstasy
Shut it down, going to take you outside 
Sifting up a reason from the lonely 
When it’s over you’ll be golden 
Over, over 
Shut it down, going to take you outside 
Sucking up the dust from your star cheek 
Just to turn away, and you'll be golden 
Over, over 
I think you got all you came for
Do you want more?
Easy is overdone, overdone
Is it gonna be right this time?
Is it gonna be golden?
Is it gonna be right this time?
Right, right, right
Oh-oh
To the pills of drugs in my pocket
I'ma pull it out and then pop it
I'ma common case of a ganja blaze
And my mind is fading quite frankly 
It's made me question, never that by
Give my mind a question
What kind of sorcery is this?
Dark night and a night eclipse
Icy, icy, icy
One more request
Release my pain 
D'you think you got all you came for
Lover, lover
Easy is the way you free fall 
Into the lap of inertia
I think you got all you came for
Do you want more?
Easy is overdone, overdone

Brain dead

Fear will swallow your heart
Blood shed in this shed

Fuck a juice, lose a inch
Fuck your teeth, put em' on a tee
Jesus mezanmi

I gotta talk about my life as I see it
Biggie
Ayy, yo
Biggie
Uh, yo, check it
Uh, yo
Biggie
It's a shame, who do we blame?
The government restrain to maintain the system we contain 
Tolerate wads of flows, give up commercial lyrical shows
This ain't 5-0 folders, phony fakes saying, "Fuck 12"
Not that I condone the killing, but squares get detected since 
Get what I'm sayin'?
My word is always bond
24/7, eleven's peel cerebellums on those who go to plottin'
Knockin' noggins, beheadin' politicians
Plans that's optimistic, propendous and not 'spicious
Never fictitious, hopin' I become the richest
Venomous lyrical switches, whipped bitches
Fuck once snitches 'til eyes twitch, ayy 
Witch get stitched, not get fixed
But we'd need revolutionaries in this world
Maybe put down the TEC and find your intellect and use that nonsense and flex
Each year, younger, younger havin' sex
With the only thing that swears the previous lines and what's up next
Reach my apex, kick in the door, wavin' the .44
I wave a message, I hope you think it's impressive
Colossal done sent us to approve the youth mental
Come in gentle, no detrimental, once upon a time I found my divine mind
Inflicted apex vibes through these lines
That I bind, rise and grind to this shine
And unwind wads of wop, headed straight to the top 
If I make it, it's cops still pop top's on the block
I guess that's why I copped the Glock
Cop glocked at my pops, he survived that, runnin' traffic on Trinity Ave
When niggas like Slick work up in the apartment
Cypher cast 'bout six words in my esophagus
My word is bound
Zay, you suck
I don't even know what I'm gonna rap on this shit , straight up
This is so shit
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God
Okay, okay, alright
Very angry while trying to strangle my balls
Wipe my ass with some butter while scraping shit on the wall
But honestly overall, I like popping an Adderall
While dancing around, clapping a pansy in overalls
It's no wonder why my mother hates me
I beat my dick to porn flicks of Martin Lawrence with autistic babies
Child molestin', incest, it wasn't a question
Beat her like Sean Penn, venom in my pen
Rape a broad while kissin' on Christian Bale
In fact, if I go to Hell, it's likely I'll go to jail
I heard in prison they like all the little kids
So me and that Woody Allen were planning to take a trip
"Oh Woody, such a big woody
Stop touching my penis, so cover it with a hoodie
You promised me if I came, you'd give me a bunch of goodies
What's in that black backpack?"
"Oh it's nothing", well, nothing turned into something
'Cause soon as the cops passed, Woody just hauled ass
Cops stopped us, Woody asked for a kiss
Told the officers coming that, "Woody's touching my dick"
*chuckles*
Martin Lawrence in my backseat
In my- , in my backseat
It's a kick in the door
In the door, ayy
I'ma go up on niggas, yes
Hey-oh
Ha-ha 
Howdy y'all, fuck shit, you lied a bit, came off this shit's like- *screaming*

I'm still gettin dough and fuckin these hoes
My knob gettin' touched like a door

She give me herself for the low 
Aight though, said I ain't with the shit
But I got the hammer like Bob The Builder ho

It would bring us together
You and Regan?

When you're born, can you be born with sauce? Or do you— Do you acquire the sauce?
No, you can't be born with the sauce!
You— You— You get sauce— You get sauce from—
How you gonna be born with season?
Mhm
You gotta get season. I was born without a sauce
Hell yeah
I acquired the sauce!
Sever her bonds, you take the wheel, I lost control, ayy
She did it all for some clarification that you've never known, ayy
Give it a rest, best gesture the bastard could offer was the sacrifice of his
Clarity, so where is the fairer few? Will never be free of this
So I pray the fucker repent
Trifle, the foolish, will not give me bank
I fuck the face of the few I resent
I flee the light without doubt in my head
She did it all for some clarity
I pray I do not embarrass her
If I am alone, she is my God
And I am the Devil resent from Heaven
She did it all for some clarity, ayy 
I pray I do not embarrass her 
If I am alone, she is my God
And I am the Devil resent from Heaven 
She did it all for some clarity 
I pray I do not embarrass her 
If I am alone, she is my God 
And I am the Devil resent from Heaven 
She did it all from some clarity 
She did it all from some clarity 
She did it all from some clarity 
I pray I do not— 
She did it all from some clarity 
I pray I do not embarrass her 
If I am alone, she is my GodFuck nigga, what is your rank?
Take me to hell, bitch, I came
I rip the head off the pope
I don't need love, I need dope
Fuck nigga, what is your rank?
Take me to hell, bitch, I came
I rip the head off the pope
I don't need love, I need dopeLove is not kisses, hugs, sharing fucking drugs
Presents on your birthday, pictures of making love
It’s dedication, trust and patience and compromise
Now do or die, ultimatums for you and I
I feel the vibe between us fading and I fucking hate it
I cut myself constantly I hate myself for creating
Pain within your heart and I’m thinking
This pistol's tempting to scream it out
To my demons get even within yourself
She’s crying she needs your help
And you’re selfish think ‘bout yourself
All these problems created
Extended from hate with self
And I hope that you wouldn’t leave
But the patience that you would need
Is the patience of several gods
Hanging on to my selfish please
And I’m sorry, you deserve better
I wanted more for you, you hanging on
You being strong and I want more for you
As long as you won’t, leave me in the end
We both can still pretend

Let's see, let's see where it takes us
Yeah, wish I had my other journal on me
Yeah, listen
I was thinking like a week ago
Trying to find some sort of recollection, I was
Two-stepping in my mind, I was
Stuttering inside my mind, I
I'm tryna find the right words, the right hertz
The right field, the right vibe
Tryna find the right high, the right ride
Tryna find the right bitch, the right time
But I think I did
'Cause you treat me like a king and I can't
Ever be ungrateful that's why I am faithful
That's why I am loyal, that's why I am royal
To the very end
The difference between y- and my mom-, uh, yeah
The difference between me and my father is I don't like
Being disloyal to any being on this planet
Fuck that Bible bullshit they teach
Adam and Eve, I don't believe in anything that make me seem evil
I make a woman vice versa
Ayy
Maybe I should pick a pen again
Pick up pi-pick up p-p-pick a pen again, uh
And this instrument, what up? How do I use it?
Gekyume, uh, Gekyume, I can smell the fume
I was thinking like a week ago, I said
How do I get here? How did I get here? Where do I go now?
Gekyume, I said, "Can you clear the negative manifestation?"
If everything came off the dome, I'd be a piece of shit
Honestly, I gotta sit back and think, maybe I be, uh
Maybe I be trippin', maybe I be bitchin', uh, yeah
Maybe I'm too sensitive but maybe I'm just me, uh
Is that the wrong thing or the right thing?
Or the right one at the right time? Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy
Brace as you feel the cold like the winter snow
I flew in December defeating my slumber, I'm drowning and you'll never know
Blasted, blasted, want the pressure-pressure
Among the lord, succumb to me under pressure, ayy
Brace
Look at the slits on my wrist
Look at the blood in my piss
Cold as my heart
Tend to get better at this by the time when I wasn't just
Cold from the start
Grabbin' the K with intentions, you bust it, but niggas be jumpin'
And plus if you add it up, add it up, put it up in yo' heart
Pussy, might find yo' heart

But she gon' stunt, in this letterman, in my letterman
In my letterman
See, haha
Hip-hop's a jungle, nah
You see my raps became subordinate
Posting portraits of flow and gin
More the note of the porridge
Than more anointed than ordain
More annoyed than an orphan
From Corbin who's off the morphine
And snorting some block detergent, merging for common purpose
They notice that I was soaking in lotion
Running the motion, devotion was not a notion
Hoping that Lexi's open for fucking
Fuck it I’m ducking, and trucking off to New Zealand
I’m wheeling, dealing, cartwheeling
Pop pill and feeling like villain
Haha
Ah, fuck your feelings, young nigga

You afraid of death, horror movie, triple X
You a fake fuck boy, yuh, yuh, yuh

Xanax instead of oxygen in a world full of these moccasins
Opsidus, exodus, Percocets, Ecstasy in the molly
Will you let a little nigga drop a note, get drunk, then have a nigga fuck you in the throat, little bit of weed
Little bit of coke, roll roads, hit your throat, get cocky on the low, put a gun to your throat
Sex-tape, let's tape this shit, embrace this place then rape the bitch
Yo, gang this shit so crisp, my wrist so slit up, shit I think I pissed or shit my pants
Yo' mans ain't shit, fuck a bitch, little lick, little league, little tits
Breeze OD, smoke GO3, oh me, oh my, oh ho, shit, die
Mama should've swallowed you, bitch, please die
Fist fight, die young, bee stung, tree hung, we-we hung
Could have been equivalent to the heroin, you need medicine, better grin, better lean

Vigorous niggers that hated my mothers
Vigorous niggas that hated my mothers 
As vivid as black castles back in the past, faster than ever
They hated niggas be basic, niggas just face it
Niggas be mellow, I hate it, I sling 'em like jello
Whatever the weather, I'm comin' with cheddar, your ho know
Hate it, bitch, call me Lucifer the foe
I'm for the foe, aim for you feet, came with a TEC, aim for your neck
Fuck a nigga bitch, swear I'm the shit, but I be bitter
Hating the bitch, slapping the bitch, dick slapping the bitch
Realest nigga out, god damn I'm the shit
Bitch my nigga I'm mobbin', slumped up shawty
Your bitch she want the 40's so I hit her with the Molly
Bitch, that baby ain't mine, I ain't really 'bout the crime
I'm just really bout the murder, bitch, give her fucking time
I be out my damn mind, I be all up in my zone
Smoking dope with yo' ho, bitch call me for the 40Awowowow 
Elliott Gould: The irony is that most of the stores that were destroyed during the riots were owned by black people
Edward Furlong: That's stupid though, I mean, why trash your own neighborhood?
Elliott Gould: That's my point it's an irrational act, it's like an expression of rage by people who feel neglected and turned away by the system
Beverly D'Angelo: Exactly, I mean it's like we had in Watts or the riots in Chicago in '68
Edward Norton: It's crap, I don't buy that for a minute. Calling a riot an irrational expression of rage, that's such a copout, it's opportunism at it's worst, it's a bunch of people grabbing any excuse they can find to go and loot a store, nothing more
Ah, ah
Ayy, claws piercing her throat 
Need a lioness, nose covered in coke 
Pride to it, need a chain hanging I choke 
Pride to it, need a bass banging I joke 
Jump gang that's 12 people no joke 
Said have feelings that's my caron no joke 
My coupe with me them stab wounds are no joke 
My pack with me don't feel niggas no joke 
Uh, eyes locked on my prey 
It's follow the leader, you spread and your niggas get sprayed
I'm eyeing your chain, I'm eyeing your chain 
What's up with your niggas
They eyeing me looking like they want to get 'em some
*Woman screams*
Ayy, claws piercing her throat
Need a lioness, nose covered in coke
Pride to it, need a chain hanging I choke
Pride to it, need a bass banging I joke
Ayy, claws piercing her throat
Need a lioness, nose covered in coke
Pride to it, need a chain hanging I choke

Ayy, claws piercing her throat

Pride to it, need a chain hanging I choke
Pride to it, need a bass banging I jokeSever the mind
Wonder what you'll find within the souls divine
Put ’em on ice
Watch the nigga slip, think he will not suffice
Make 'em idle, all to be infamous
Time becomes a fucking rival
Basically battled the devil within himself
He faced the fucking tidal wave
Hands moving all in my fucking face, I hate this place
Goddamn, disgusted by my face
I feel like a waste of damn skin because the tint that's on my faceVery Rare Boys, nigga 
Y'all feel like that?
Yo
Hm, see me
Mama had to send me into church
Fucking monster with a TEC, boy, I aim for your neck 
Had your brother' mother wet, 'cause she know I'm the best, I'm sick 
Rap so sinister, murder your local minister 
Lyrics bitter as vinegar, spittin' in your perimeter
Heard you straight as a cylinder, so I can't fucks wit' you
All my niggas is gang bangers and diss niggas
Heard we was bumpin', so you had to bring your clique with ya'
So you know I had to put a bullet in 'bout six niggas 
Fuck niggas, they running their triathlon
Catch me gettin' sloppy wit’ a bitch that look like Asher Roth 
And I ain't playin' games like zombies, bitch, I'm getting trains
Runnin' trains and bitches killing snitches in an aeroplane
And I'm a menace, see more mouths than a dentist
I'm killing till I'm replenished, you niggas don't know the half of it
Half-ass rappers talking shit, check the time
Turn around and see my nigga's wit' me totin' .49's
And know they mad 'cause I ain't really stuntin' shit
I hate the bitch and have my other wife who playing wit' my dick 
Swallow spitting, swallow spitting, she swallow spitting
Said this since beginning, I'm just beginning, intend on winning
Yo, hahahaha
Hmm-mhm
Hooligan in the hoodie, no Zimmerman
And shoot me, I got visions in my head, you'll soon see
Savin' my dollars for Mary Jane to get baked clean
Myself off with a sunbathing ape
Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more
I don't take that fuck shit, I don't even want your bitch 
She tryna 'press me with some Lucy rose shit
Let a real nigga roll, oh, you wasting all the weed
Wearing all this  black 'cause I'm killing all this tree
Druggie nigga, I'm a slump boy
In for the 'bidden fruit, should given me joy
But my pastor always talk, I gotta lie to me
These nigga's biting me like sharks tryin' to clone me 
But shit, that's power and respect 
Sippin' from the holy grail, while getting neck
Don't need to sneeze to know I'm blessed
I'm Versace, motherfucker, you guessed
Small car, they try to get higher
The pussy I slay, but her's is a fighter
You're mad 'cause you can't be like me
I stunt, I flex, and I burn Mary, G 
I stick to the code
Fall back and let young niggas watch them take notes
Uh 
Shagadava, ah fu-
Y'all feel like that?I regained the breathe of the last man
I'm so relaxed soon we are the blessed one
I will recollect the body manifest
And puff a cigarette, six sicker
Body flip 'em, wrists is slit, could give a shit
If mama showed me how the fuck it's done
Lost friend feelin' shitty, called pissy sissy
Broad feelin' like death or when I'm ready
And out of the darkness the zombie did call
True pain and suffering 
He brought to them all
*chuckles*
Bullets like confetti, axe to the brain
Drugs for the pain, how you feel the same, love?
But they'll never ask for the pain
Ask for a slipknot, then we hang
Pretty pushy broad, make her pussy trod
Razorblade upon the skin with every sin
We could reminisce, we were fuckin' pissed
Now I'm in this shit, pissed as a bitch
*baby crying*
Bullets like confetti, axe to the brain
Drugs for the pain, how you feel the same, love?
But they'll never ask for the pain
Ask for a slipknot, then we hang
Pretty pushy broad, make her pussy trod
Razorblade upon the skin with every sin
We could reminisce, we were fuckin' pissed
Now I'm in this shit, pissed as a bitchOkay, so it's recording, it's recording now.
It's 8:31 AM and I am currently talking to my laptop and I don't exactly know how to have a conversation with my laptop while I'm by myself
So this is gonna be, um how do you call it, a try?
Um, so here we go.
So I'm pretty sure we have a lot of SoundCloud fans that actually don't have a Twitter, Tumblr, or an Instagram or anything such as that.
Cause I'm sure that a lot of you just discovered my music through SoundCloud and probably don't know how to get in contact with me.
So here's how we're gonna, here's how we're gonna keep in contact for those of you that actually, like diehard fans.
Cause I'm pretty sure a lot of our diehard fans don't have the main social networks.
So what I want you guys to do is either download Tumblr, Twitter, Instagram, or maybe even Snapchat.
And I'm gonna give you each of my names and I'm gonna put em in the, in the description and I'm gonna put my partners' names and I'm gonna, like different, different people that I'm working with or whatever you guys want from me.
I'm gonna start answering questions through Tumblr so if you wanna get in contact with me to have a conversation, you're gonna contact me through Tumblr.
If you want to, I mean just look at what the fuck I'm thinking and have a comment on what I'm thinking, that would usually be on Twitter.
Um, Instagram obviously is just, just photos
I mean the extent to it's just a DM, I see pretty much where I check is the DM's is why I go on Instagram. So if you wanna get in contact with me, again, Instagram.
My, I'll give you contact to my manager so that way you can contact my managers easier if you have a line of business that you want to contact me for. Please only contact if it is for business.
What, I mean as far as the shows we have, what's the shows we have coming up?
We have one in West Palm, West Palm Beach on Friday with Wifisfuneral.
And then I have a, I have a show with my partner the day after and also with my partner Pollari, Kevin Pollari.
I mean if you wanna come to those shows, those are the dates.
Friday, West Palm Beach, myself and wifisfuneral.
And Saturday, I'll be attending my partner's show in, what is it, Miami?
Well, so yeah it's in Wynwood, Miami.
So what I need you guys to do is go on our social networks and follow us.
So for Twitter, my social network name would be what my artist name is on SoundCloud.
X-X-X-T-E-N-T-A-C-I-O-N
For, I'll give you Instagram, for Instagram: heroinfather, H-E-R-O-I-N-F-A-T-H-E-R
For Snapchat, theheroinfather, T-H-E-H-E-R-O-I-N-F-A-T-H-E-R
Tumblr, xxxtentacion.tumblr.com, so X-X-X-T-E-N-T-A-C-I-O-N, dot tumblr, T-U-M-B-L-R, dot com.
And, um, I'm pretty sure that'd be it.
Alright, well, on a different note, here's what I'll cover. We'll call it "a helping hand."
Damn, I gotta get in my feelings I guess.
For those of you that I guess feel misguided or feel, what would the word be?
A little bit not in tune with what's going on around you and you feel confused, you feel like you're just following whatever is right in front of you
Here's what I call a helping hand, here's how I'll help you do it:
With whatever you apply your attention to is which direction your life will go in.
So say for instance you see money in your life and that's what you want more of.
The more you apply your attention towards money is the more it will appear.
The more you apply your attention towards bad things in your life, the more it will appear.
The more you apply your attention, such as the good things in your life, the more it will appear.
People think that people such as DJ Khaled, or like people that are successful maybe people like Kanye.
Or these bigger artist, they see them as crazy because of what they display and that they display it so simple, but it's literally what it is.
So, the key to success would be more success. The more you apply your attention towards your success.
The more you apply your attention to the good things around you, the more you apply your attention to the things that you want in your life is the more it appears.
And that, there's no other way to actually say that, so for those of you that feel like you've been thrown into some sort of disarray.
Woah, did it pause? Oh, well no it didn't pause.
Yeah, for those of you that are kind of like lost in space in your mind, just understand that your attention is important.
Whatever you, whatever you, how do I put it?
What you want will appear if you surround yourself with it.
So if you want that brand new car, surround yourself with success, surround yourself with money so this car will eventually pop up.
There's no simpler way-holy shit.
Shouts out to Teflon Sean.
You need to make a, need to make a SoundCloud, Teflon.
But yeah, also, study the Golden Beetle.
With that being said, goodbye.Alleged Lyrics

And I will probably hit it, kiss it, flip it 
Rip or break a wrist I bet your bitch a bitch

She sucking it sloppy, aye 
Nigga don't want no stress
Nigga don't want no coke 
Nigga don't wanna talk gang money 
Itty bitty nigga wanna pull up on a nigga
Let the shit go bang, bang 
I'm aiming it straight for your brain 
Fuckin’ with my niggas
That fuck with the figures 
That pull up with guns and just slay 
Xanny clouds make her aroused
She wanna pop an Adderall
Put her on the Molly 
"You can fuck my head and then the draws" 
Fake hoe, snake hoe 
Mad 'cause my case closed 
Put me in a cape and I still won't fucking save a hoe 
Captain save a hoe , you a captain save a hoe 
Captain save a hoe , you a captain save a hoe 
Bad bitch, I did that
Bape stuff, I bought that
Foreign whip, I skrt that
Don’t ring around me, shits platinum
Big dick, she hate that
Too black for a face tat
Fuck the jaw and the neck crack
Baby ZiLLA, top map
Stepped on you with the whole map
My lap, she is sat
Sucked me up, then I booled back
Next day, I ain't call her back
So at that point my soul is black
Look in my eyes, you ain't coming back
She a hoe, she ain't coming back
Dat boys

        Alright, I found this sound in Stockholm
The comfortin' I feel with it
It's a form of hypnotism
Do you feel it?
So if I escape
Will my pain go away?
This thing should be needless to say
I walk in my mind and I wonder
But till death the inferno, I plunder
Action misleading the spared
There is a home, but with nobody there
In debt with the darkness for years and the centuries
A body is hidden, so you ought to envy
Your actions are covered in sin
But you've never felt so alive
If you think that you're leaving, you're wrong
You've not a choice but to die
Envy this, so to speak, no despair, go to sleep 
Envy this, so to speak, no despair, go to sleep 
Envy this, so to speak, no despair, go to sleep
There is no escape 
There is no escape
There is no escape
I found this sound in Stockholm
So comfortin'
I feel, I feel as if it's a form of hypnotism
Do you feel this?Rest in peace
I'm 'bout to body a nigga
Illuminati a nigga
Uh, what
Okay
I'm fuckin' icy, where my cool pack?
Give me a Kool-Aid and 'bout eight racks
I could body any nigga on a 8 track
Maybe 'bout eight-mile, fuck your style, nigga
I'ma be wildin', I'ma be stylin'
'Til a motherfucker die in a ground, eight feet under
Swear to God, I'll be hot as thunder
Motherfucker, I'm the shit, triple six
Fuck a bitch, I'm the shit, never that
Never rat, body bag, rag, hmm
That bag, hmm- back again
Get a brown bag for my niggas in a brown jag, fuck that
Lu- Lucifer
Where the Ruger that'll blow right through you?
Swear to God, I'm the shit, triple six, fuck your bitch
Black Benz in the pen, fuck your paper, elevator
Tell the waiter, I'll be elevated
Motherfucker so high that I can touch the sky
I'm in outer space and my house be vacant
I'll be trappin' so the homies can make it
And I do it so the homies keep takin'
'Cause the streets ain’t nothing easy, be on your grinder
Poked him in his eye and I gave that boy a shiner
But it's simple, the nigga say you know it all, popping Adderall
Chilling, 'til I'm dead, nigga
Fuck your head nigga
Youngblood
Triple six
Aw shit
Aw shit
Let Ski hop on this shit, alright
Very Rare tell me take off, nigga, I'm goin' NASA
You gon' need about four or five pastors
I'ma roll through, nigga thought I told you
'Bout two clips and an OE go through
I go through, fall through, do I fall ho?
Damn, I'm divin' in through a... fat ho 
Got a fat pocket, though
Still with my motherfucking hockey and my sack of dough
Dope in my sock and I still put my cock
And jizz in your bitch, inject in a-
Do a split on your dick if you think you the shit
And I'm rolling 'round town like a motherfucking-, damn
Ski the shit, ride around and I'm fucking your bitch
Ride around and I'm coming through your town, nigga I'm-
Hold up, alright, though
Hold up, I said

Break a bitch back if you think you attack
Mac in a book bag, nigga on attack with a MAC
To your back, nigga, make your head go splat
Make your head go splat, rat-a-tat-tat, bring the K
Bring the AK with me anywhere, anyway, hey
Ski, Ski
Nigga
E-Boogie, nigga
Gonna get jiggy on this track
Fuck that shit, I rap that ape shit, that Bape shit
Niggas don't wanna play shit, it's all I spent but I'm tight clip
Niggas don't wanna talk that shit, until I fuck your wife, bitch
Now you wanna talk that shit, why don't you just at me?
Bitch-nigga can't pass me, these niggas don't 'rass me
I'm rapping like Jeezy, but my voice ain't raspy
This is that coke flow, that dope flow
Fuck a bad bitch in a porno, nigga, that is so flow
Snow flow on my wrist, bitch, that mean I'm icy
Why the fuck your bitch like me? She wanna wife me
To type me, not Pokémon, nigga, while I'm rapping
Real nigga out here, sippin' and crappin'
Motherfucker, fuck you and your crew, V2 is the crew
So who the fuck you do? You ain't doing shit
Ain't made a move, ain't smoke weed
Seven hundred blunts in the G, motherfucker me, that is me
Kill him like a beat, motherfucker police on the street
Niggas on the beat but they don't ever wanna talk to me
Now why the fuck you getting scared?
Motherfucker hit the rares, ooh
Money's the root of all evil, so I guess we're bad people
I put the gun on the table, you think your life is unstable
Try to beat me, unable, bitches watch me like cable
I sit here reading the Bible, I'm your new-new rap idol
My life is so fucking vital, ah, ah
I'm starting from the bottom, but when I hit the top
You niggas best believe I ain't gonna stop
I'm gonna keep on coming at you and making more guap
Get these girls pussies' wetter than a fucking mop
Me and my boys, we're by my side, we ride 'til we fucking die
MPR, that's what all these ladies wanna fucking cry
Money, power, respect, we live with no regrets
Got your girl give me hickey but it's not on my neck
My dick, ah
It's New Age, fuck with me
Mmh, mmh
Mmh, mmh
Nora Spouse
Uh
Killin' and winnin' even though I'm sinnin'
I'm still gonna take your bitch and she's gonna ride this dick
Yeah, you know I do this shit everywhere I go
Niggas spittin' my own flows everywhere I go
Niggas trying copy me, copy and paste
And I've taken your bitch and I take her to my place
I'ma take her to my bed then that pussy I'ma slay
Ah, do this shit in one day
Freestyling with my niggas after school or some shit
And your bitch tryna slide with the crew, suck this dick

Grabbing on some fat ass, uh 
Throwin' all these damn stacks, uh
Woo
V2 one, eh, eh
V2, nigga, uh
Nora Sp- Abso-lutely
So soft and so tragic, as a slaughterhouse
You press the knife against your heart
And say that, "I love you so much, you must kill me, now"
"I love you-"
Beyond the pale 
Everything's black, no turning back 
Beyond the pale 
Beyond the pale 
Retribution falls for my love from the trees 
In this house of glass, I can't break free, you cannot see, okay
Love, it can be all I want, it can be all I need 
I'd much rather be alone , you'd much rather watch me bleedFalco here
Return of the Hash-Slinging Slasher 
Couldn't be, wouldn't be, slits in my wrist for you bastards, shameful 
Blades to his hand for reactions, Catholics 
Licks I'ma serve, fuck compassion, raped her
Laced with vaxes, blacks to be casted 
Rats in the hood always ask for a capture 
Facebook caption, blast to the magic
Tell a fuck nigga that I hate him with a passion
Ghosts
I'd rather be ghosts, I'd rather be ghosts
I'd rather be ghosts, I'd rather be ghosts
I'd rather be ghosts
I'd rather be ghosts in the shell 
Ghosts
I'd rather be ghosts, I'd rather be ghosts
I'd rather be ghosts, I'd rather be ghosts
I'd rather be ghosts
I'd rather be ghosts in the shell
Got drugs, mothafucka, laugh like Chris Tucker
All these hatin' ass suckas, never loved by their mothers
Nine lives and you pussy
My main bitch married, my side ho loose
Stupid ass niggas think that they shook me
But I got the MAC and I'm bigger than they could be
Stackin' my bread like loafs
She listen to me and that bitch soak
Flexin', stuntin', bitch I gloat
Off that cake and bitch I float
You sensitive fuck, get the fuck out my face
I'm makin' these moves and I come in first place
I'm stackin' my cash, I got my own place
Play with me, straight bust to the face 
Ghosts
I'd rather be ghosts, I'd rather be ghosts
I'd rather be ghosts, I'd rather be ghosts
I'd rather be ghosts
I'd rather be ghosts in the shell 
Ghosts

        Rap for the nap of a sack nigga
Who blizzardous raps bigger than men of a pack, ren
To the top of the gat, rippin, I'm busting up wack niggas
Chart or a plaque, nigga, what do you choose?
Simply irrelevant, hm, cynical evident
Please, wrestling evidence
Keys moving when definite
Soul goes for the president
Bleed red for the government
Tease-
Love is not kisses, hugs, sharing fucking drugs
Pictures on your birthday, pictures of making love
Its dedication, trusting, patience and compromise
Not do or die ultimatums for you and I
I feel the vibe between us fading, I fucking hate it
I cut myself constantly, hate myself for creating
Hate within your heart, and I'm thinking this pistol tempting
Screaming out to my demons, get even within yourself
She crying, she needs your help, and you selfish
Think 'bout yourself, all these problems created
Extended from hate for self and I-
Ah, that's all I got right nowTurn it up a little, a little more
That's good
Cocaine
Bands on my neck, hunnid bands on my neck
Pull up on a young bitch with the muthafuckin' Tec
I got bands on my neck, hunnid bands on my neck
Pull up in a nigga's city with the Tec to his chest
Young nigga comin' through with the bands
I got hunnids on me, homie, I got hunnid fuckin' bands
Pull up on a nigga, bitch I look like Charlie Brown
Coolest young nigga, rollin' through a nigga town
Hunnids on my dick, hunnids on my neck
See a pussy nigga, gets drummin' with a Tec
Pull up on yo ma's, drop a bomb on her pussy
Young nigga, I don't like relations
Fuck that lovin' mushy bullshit
With the clip, with the shits, I'm off the shits
Take your bitch I'm with the shit
Ride around with a full ass clip
Pull up on a nigga, then I shoot a nigga
Pussy nigga in a baseball bat, throw'd up a nigga
Blood on my katana, I'm comin' for yo mama
Slit her fuckin' throat, I ain't with the fuckin' drama
Blood between my nails, never fuckin' go to Yale
But I likely go to jail, just for readin' fuckin' braille
Niggas don't ever prosper, niggas don't never change
Niggas can't pull up in a nice fuckin' Range
Drama on my mind, hunnid commas on my mind
Dirty bitch, all she want is a nigga time
Blood on my katana, I'm comin' for yo mama
'Live from the grave, pussy nigga count commas
'Live for my niggas, all my niggas countin' mamas
My humble mama see the bitch she with the drama
Take it to the grave, bury her today
All my niggas with it like a muthafuckin' skirmish
I was ridin' through the hood with the hoodie, uh
Ion look like Trayvon, bust like-Lyrics from Snippet
You wanna know
I'm tryna blow
That's all it is—Bitches come and go, that's the way it go
All a nigga need is my dick and dope 
She got too excited, had to slap the bitch 
R.I.P. to ATL Young Bankroll
Had the dope on me, so I'm jugg walkin
Not equivalent to fucking moon walkin'
Shawty say she like the way I'm jugg walkin' 
Nigga run up on me put him in a coffin 
Jugg walk, jugg walk, jugg walk, jugg walk
Jugg walk, jugg walk, jugg walk
She like the way I talk, she like the way I walk 
She say its really nice, she like my jugg walk 
Jugg walk, jugg walk, jugg walk, jugg walk 
Jugg walk, jugg walk, jugg walk
She like the way I talk, she like the way I walk 
She say its really nice, she like my jugg walkI'll fuck you better on everything, on everything
Your pussy was meant for me, was meant for me
You know what you did to me, you did to me
I'm havin' withdrawals, withdrawals, withdrawals
But you don't know what you done to me, you done to me
The pussy was ecstasy, was ecstasy
You said I'm the chosen one, your only one
I know I was wrong, wrong, wrong
Pop that pussy for X to see, for X to see
I want you right under me, te amo mami
You were the one for me, the one for me
I know I did wrong, so wrong, wrong
I'll fuck you better on everything, on everything
You knew you were everything, everything
I'll fuck you with everything, on everything
I want...Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
So come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down, yeah
Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
So come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
