They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?
A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket
Your game is tired
You should retire
You're 'bout cute as
An old coupon expired
And karma's not a liar
She keeps receipts
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

What the...Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie

Katy Perry, Juicy J
Uh-huh, let's rage!
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy 
Your enemy , your enemy
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?

Don't walk away

She's a beast, I call her Karma 
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer 
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart is on steroids, 'cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her 
If you get the chance, you better keep her 
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer 
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleeping beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma 
Damn, I think I love her, shawty's so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair 
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for 
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse 
Are you ready for, ready for 
A perfect storm, perfect storm?

If she do right, told her get whatever you like
Offset

Under candlelight 
Bon appétit, babyI used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up 
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up 
Get ready cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar
Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero
You held me down, but I got up 
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up 
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar
Roar, roar, roar, roar, roar
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire

You’re gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roarI'm losing my self-control
Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
I think of you
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I

And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over, yeah
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really overDo you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moonSummer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse
But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one
The one
The one
The one that got away
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one 
The one 
The one 
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got awayI won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
’Cause my roots, they run deep, oh
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
I know it, I know it
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ”You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed
’Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, “You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Still rise
Don't be surprised, I will still riseI got a dirty mind, I got filthy ways
I’m tryna bathe my ape in your Milky Way
I’m a legend, I'm irreverent, I be reverend
I’ll be so fa-a-a-a-a-ar up
We don't give a fuh-uh-uck
Welcome to the danger zone
Step into the fantasy
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
They callin' me an alien, a big headed astronaut
Maybe it's because ya boy Yeezy get ass a lot
You’re so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You’re not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don’t understand you
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I’m ready to go, lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you’re an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It’s supernatural
Extraterrestrial
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension

Getting stupid high straight up out the jars
Pockets on Shrek, rockets on deck

I'mma disrobe you
Then I'mma probe you
See I abducted you
So I tell you what to do
I tell you what to do, what to do, what to do

I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
When did we all stop believing in magic?
Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic?
I'm the long shot
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't it be me?

They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
Hey, hey
Oh, cover me in daisies
Hey, hey
I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out 
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisiesThis was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked itYou think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back 
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real 
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonightIf I lost it all today, would you stay?
Could my love be enough to stimulate?
If shit hit the fan, grenades got thrown
Would you still show, oh?
Could you go down with me to the mat?
Could we get back up and eventually laugh?
Roll eyes at highs, cheers in the lows, and stay in the flow, whoa
'Cause I, I only got this life
And I ain't got the time, no
Not to get it right, oh
We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone to ride this ride with me
Can I get a witness? 
Will you be my witness? 
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this
Looking for a witness to get me through this
When you tell me everything, and there's no holes
You can scroll through anything, you've got the codes
Nothing to hide, it's all in their eyes
And we just know, whoa
'Cause I, I only got this life
And I ain't got the time, no
Not to get it right, oh
We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone to ride this ride with me
Can I get a witness? 
Will you be my witness? 
I'm just looking for a witness  in all of this 
Looking for a witness to get me through this
Will you be my witness?
Could you be the one that speaks for me?
Will you be my witness?
We're all just looking for connection 
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone  to ride this ride with me 
Can I get a witness?

Looking for a witness to get me through this
Oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Hey 
Oh-oh-oh
HeyYou love the hell out of me
And Heaven's where we could be
I've stood on the edge of love
But never took the leap
And you took my armor off
And did it delicately
And I let my guard down
To show you what's underneath
Thank God that you were man enough to come
Answer my mama's prayers
You asked the question, I said, "Yes"
But I'm scared
'Cause I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
Yeah, I really wanna try with you
No, I've never worn white
But I'm standin' here tonight
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"
I do
See us in sixty years with a full family tree 
Give my blood, sweat, and tears to reach our destiny 
'Cause love is a minefield, let's take this war, baby 
'Cause at the end of it all, I choose you and you choose me 
Thank God I was woman enough to come
Answer your father's prayers
You asked the question
I could tell you were scared
'Cause I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
Yeah, I really wanna try with you
No, I've never worn white
But I'm standin' here tonight
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"
Now let's dance with each other 
Mixing all of our colors
It's so easy to surrender
When you finally find forever
No, I've never worn white, no
But I really wanna try with you
Yeah, I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"
'Cause I do
Oh, I do, yeah, yeah
I doWaking up next to you in the middle of the week
Never needed anyone to send me off to sleep
And I know I said go slow, but I can't hold back no more
Got a premonition this ain’t gonna be a fling
You make the weekend feel like a year
Baby, you got me changing
24/7, I want you here
I hope you feel the same thing
I want you to be the one that's on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
I want you to be there on a Monday night
Tuesday night, every night
Are you gonna be the one that's on my mind?
3-6-5, all the time
I want you to be the one to stay
And give me the night and day
Love it when you come back and can’t take it when you leave
Got me fantasizing our initials already
And I wanna just let go, falling deeper than before
Say that you are ready, lock it up in a heartbeat
I want you to be the one that's on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
I want you to be there on a Monday night

24/7, 3-6-5You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch; I would know
And you overthink, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
 You don't really wanna stay, no
 But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
We used to be just like twins, so in sync
The same energy, now's a dead battery
Used to laugh  'bout nothing 
Now you're plain  boring 
I should know  that you're not gonna change
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

 But you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out

Happy birthdayThere's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbeque
This a hickey or a bruise?
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa
But this Friday night, do it all again
But this Friday night, do it all again
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart 
How did I read the stars so wrong? 
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems 
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long
I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete
Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine
I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet 
Need nothing to complete myself, no 
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend 
The story's over now, the end
I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete
Falling from cloud nine 
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight 
I'm falling from cloud nine 
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling 
I am trying to hold on 
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side 
But I'm not blind anymore
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine 
Crashing from the high
You know, I'm letting go tonight 
I'm falling from cloud nine
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awakeDays like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me drown
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Now look at me, I’m sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won’t ever put me out again
I’m glowing, oh whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah, yeah, except for me
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no 
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul 
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me 
Away from me 
This is the part of me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
No
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, noIsn't it strange that you used to know me?
All the highs and lows and in-betweens
And now you see me and just say, "Hey"
Isn't it weird that you've seen me naked?
We had conversations 'bout forever
Now it's 'bout the weather‚ okay
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers
Yeah
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk
Isn't it wild that I know your weakness?
And everybody at the party thinks
That you're the best since sliced bread
And isn't it awkward I got a new somebody?
And honestly it'll probably be a while before we can just be friends
I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been 
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk
Blah-blah-blah-blah

Your mind may refuse to believe
I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat
And drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it’s almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys

You're so sad, maybe you should buy a happy meal
You’re so skinny, you should really Super Size the deal
Secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you
I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you out of your head
I'm so angry 'cause you’d rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup
And

Truth is that I lost myself inside you
It is not fair to put all that on you
But you took control of a vulnerable soul 
I am my mother’s daughter
And there are so many things I love about her
But I have, I have to break the cycle
So I can sit first at the dinner table
You can't clip my wings, can't wilt my flowers
Stole my time, but I'll make up the hours
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
Power
Hell hath no fury like a woman reborn
And now I'm burning like a blue flame once more
But don't mistake my warmth for weakness
Don't bite the hand that feeds or you'll
You'll never eat, no-oh
You can't clip my wings, can't wilt my flowers
Stole my time, but I'll make up the hours
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
Power 
And now I'm taking it back
Electric as fuck 
You can't quiet this thunder, no 
Yeah, I'm taking it back
Lit all the way up
Even in the dark, I glow 
You can't clip my wings, can't wilt my flowers
Stole my time, but I'll make up the hours, oh
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
PowerI live off the echoes of your "I love you's"
But I still feel the blows from all of your "don't want to's" 
When you're drunk, you say I’m the one
Then you wake up
You suck my hope up in a vacuum
'Cause every day's the same
Definition of insane
I think we're running on a loop
Déjà vu
So tell me something new
Figure out the Rubik's Cube
I think we're running on a loop
Déjà vu
Your words are like Chinese water torture
And there's no finish line, always one more corner
Yeah, they slither like a centipede
Why do you keep me
At the end of a rope that keeps getting shorter?
'Cause every day's the same

Playing by the rules in this game of life
365 days on the grind
Something's stirring, I might need to unwind
Then, there's you
Texting me a little bubble of trouble
I've tried to ignore these thoughts that rumble
I think I'm bored of being so careful
Big city lights
Got me flirting with fire
Tonight I'ma let my hair down
Have a few rounds and just let go
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Like roulette 
Let's roll it 
They say everything in moderation
And sometimes, you got to give in to temptation
So I drop a pin to my location
Let's roll the dice
Big city lights
Got me flirting with fire
Tonight I'ma let my hair down
Have a few rounds and just let go
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Oh, like roulette 
Let's roll it 
Like roulette 
Let's roll it 
So tonight, we test limits 
Take the safety off for a minute 
'Cause my love's a bullet with your name written on it
Just load it and spin it
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you 
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you 
Like roulette 
Let's roll it 
Like roulette 
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like rouletteComparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one
I still got the seed
You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes
You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test
He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth , oh
He pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your
The best
And yes, I do regret
How I could let myself let you go
Now, now the lesson's learned
I touched it, I was burned
Oh, I think you should know
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you 
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your, your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh, won't you walk through
And bust in the door and take me away?
Oh, no more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes, I'd like to stay
StaySaw your picture on accident
Your face has changed
The lines are sinking in
I pressed play, I should haven't
Congratulations
But do you ever wonder what we could have been?
But your mind plays tricks with distance
Always makes things feel so unfinished
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
I saw a balloon floating away
I thought, "Did someone let go, or did they lose it?"
So strange, you know all my secrets
Please keep them safe
And darling, you know that I'll do the same
Though we're no longer in existence
Baby, you'll always be in my orbit
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you
We were a match, but not a fit
We were a dream, unrealistic
We didn't lose, we didn't win
Oh
I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you
I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you
Ohh-oh-oh-oh 
No-oh-oh-oh-oh I remember when you used to be my every other thought
But now my calendar's so full, it's easier to move on
Sometimes I swear I pass your SUV on Sunset Boulevard
I don't fuck with change, but lately, I've been flipping coins a lot
I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft
You don't have to subtweet me
My number's always been the same
But all's been said and done
Will we ever really close this case?
Yeah, I will always be here for you, but I could no longer stay
Still my body goes in shock every time I hear your name
I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft
I've heard you've done some changing
I've been rearranging
Wish that I could know, but I just don't know
Never get that time back
Fear we'd fall in old traps
Why can't we just let go?
Staring at a fork in the fucking road
I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie 
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draftPlease don't tip-toe
Come close, let's flow
Anchor in me, and get lost at sea
The world's your oyster and I am the pearl
Open waters
Sink into me slowly
So baby, come and take a swim with me
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy
Don't be scared to dive in deep
And start a tsunami
Tsunami
Don't fight
Just ride the rhythm of the tide
We swirl, we spin
Salted, sun-kissed skin
We float together
Whatever weather
Embrace the breeze and sail away smoothly
So baby, come and take a swim with me
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy
Don't be scared to dive in deep
And start a tsunami
Tsunami
Oh, you're waking up an ocean of emotion
That my body can't hide 
Tsunami 
Now you're soaked in my devotion
'Cause you opened up a paradise 
Tsunami 
Tsunami
So baby, come and take a swim with me 
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy 
Don't be scared to dive in deep 
And start a tsunami

A long vacation didn't sound so bad
Was full of secrets, locked up tight like Iron Mountain
Running on empty, so out of gas
Thought I wasn’t enough
Found I wasn’t so tough
Laying on the bathroom floor
We were living on a fault line
And I felt the fault was all mine
Couldn’t take it anymore
By the grace of God 
I picked myself back up 
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way
I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water
When the truth was like swallowing sand
Now every morning, there is no more mourning
Oh, I can finally see myself again
I know I am enough, possible to be loved
It was not about me
Now I have to rise above
Let the universe call the bluff
Yeah, the truth will set you free
By the grace of God 
I picked myself back up 
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out
Oh, that way, no
That way, no
Not in the name of love 
That way, no
That way, no
I am not giving up
By the grace of God
I picked myself back up
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror 
Looked in the mirror 
By the grace of God 
I picked myself back up 
I put one foot in front of the other and I 
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that wayUnder a silver moon, tropical temperature
I feel my lotus bloom
Come closer
I want your energy, I want your aura
You are my destiny, my mantra
I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary 
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary 
Go down in history, go down together
Into infinity, forever
Your Cleopatra, your blushing Juliet
Anything for your love, a ride or die
Oh, I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers

And get scared that I might leave you?
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
She’s always been a perfect mystery
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
And that's what makes a woman to me
Is it the way I cut my hair
And put no makeup on?
I feel most beautiful
Doing what the fuck I want
Is it that my intuition
Is never really off?
I need tissues for my issues
And Band-Aids for my heart
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn’t
Describe what makes a woman
She's always been a perfect mystery
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
And that's what makes a woman to me
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
That's what makes a woman to me
Oh, oh 
Oh, oh
Is it the way we keep
The whole world turning
In a pair of heels?
Yeah, that's what makes a womanI know there's gotta be rain if I want the rainbows
And I know the higher I climb, the harder the wind blows
Yeah, I've gone to sleep night after night punching a pillow
But do you know the darker the night, the brighter the stars glow?
'Cause I am resilient
A full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, oh no
I am resilient
Born to be brilliant
You'll see me grow right through the cracks, yeah
'Cause you're gonna watch this flower grow
Right through the cracks
I've got to shed all the skin if I want the distance
Let the sun in, pull out the weeds and focus my vision
'Cause there’s no mistakes, just bends and breaks and friction
But do you know the hotter the fire, the purer the gold is?
'Cause I am resilient
A full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, oh yeah
I am resilient
Born to be brilliant
I'm gonna grow right through the cracks
Oh
'Cause I died every winter
But survived all the weather
Look at me now, look at me now
I'm in full bloom, yeah
They tried to poison the water
But I was a little stronger
Look at me now, look at me now
I light up the room, oh yeah
'Cause I am resilient 
A full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, no
Oh, I am resilient
Born to be brilliant
I'm gonna grow right through the cracks
Oh, you're gonna watch this flower grow
Right through the cracksHave you ever lost, lost the light in your life?
Have you ever left, left yourself behind?
Have you ever lied and just replied "I'm fine"?
'Cause I can see you've lost, lost the light in your life
Wanna run like your mascara
Wine-stained lips talkin' to the mirror
If the sun comes up, don't even care at all
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Promise one day, baby, they're gonna dry
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
If love has left you with, with a question mark
If trust has left you fallin' in nobody's arms
If you wanna hide like your emotions
Heart can't break, it's already broken
If the sun comes up, don't even care at all
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Promise one day, baby, they're gonna dry

Only love, only love
Eighty-six thousand, four hundred seconds in a day
I swear lately most of 'em have been a waste
I feel 'em come and go, bury my mistakes
But time just goes on and on in a way
If I had one day left to live
And if the stars went out on me, the truth is
Yeah, there's so much I'd say and do
If I had nothing to lose, nah, nothing to lose
Oh, I'd call my mother and tell her I'm sorry
I never call her back
I'd pour my heart and soul out into a letter
And send it to my dad
Like, oh my God, the time I've wasted
Lost in my head
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead
Give me
Only love, only love
Give me
Only love, only love
I swear sometimes I hear myself talking, getting mad
Take shit so personal, like it really matters
Oh, am I awake, am I sleepwalking? Tell me that
It's scary how quickly I lose perspective and I react
If I had one day left to live
And if the stars went out on me, the truth is
Yeah, there's so much I'd say and do
If I had nothing to lose, no, nothing to lose
Oh, I'd call my mother and tell her I'm sorry
I never call her back
I'd pour my heart and soul out into a letter
And send it to my dad
Like, oh my God, the time I've wasted
Lost in my head
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead
Give me
Only love, only love
Give me
Only love, only love 
Yeah, give me
Only love, only love
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead
Give me 
Only love, only love

Only love, only love 
Only love, only love 
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me 
And take the love instead
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead
Give me
Only love, only love
Yeah, give me
Only love, only loveI'm thirty-something going on thirteen
Still a sponge to everything
Saucer eyes wide, yeah, I still believe
And a sparkle in my steps
Smiling with my teeth
They say that I might lose my Midas touch
They also say I may become irrelevant
But who the fuck are they anyway?
I don't care what they say
I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age
Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age
So, I recommend that you lose your mind
It was the only thing that was keeping me behind
They say curb your curiosity
They also say prepare to amend your dreams
But who the fuck are they anyway?
I don't care what they say
'Cause I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age 
Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age
How old would you be? Yeah
How old would you really be
If you didn't know, yeah
How old you really were?
How old would you be? Yeah
How old would you really be
If you didn't know 
How old you really were?
I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age
Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age
Oh-oh, I won't act my age
Ooh, yeah, ooh
Ooh, yeah, ooh
I won't act my ageI lost my tug of war today
Took my foot off of the brakes
But what comes up must hit the ground
So I drink these anvils down
It's a dance with the devil
A stumbling tango
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow
It's a dance
It's a dance
It's a dance
Just want to connect
But you won't let me do it
So I get altered, 
Wish less was going on
Wish I could just throw the ball
And ignore it all
It's a dance with the devil
A mercurial wrestle
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow
It's a dance
It's a dance
It's a...
But what, what is it worth
Waking up with a crown of clouds?
What is it worth
When my head spins out with doubt?
Wish I could measure
When the poison is pouring out
Oh...
It's a dance
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you 
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you 
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you 
Oh, no, oh, no I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it
Can't go with the flow, got to make waves
Even though I look at the sand, and I'm just one grain
But my intuition says there's a bigger mission I must embrace
So I'm, I'm pushing my thoughts to a new place
I'm kicking and screaming
'Cause it won't be easy
To break all the patterns
If I'm not evolving
I'm just another robot
Taking up oxygen
It's something bigger than me
I can feel it beginning
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it
But it keeps on growing
Out of control
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening
So I'll speak my truth though my voice shakes 
Try to summon the strength to look fear in the face
But I'm kicking and screaming
'Cause it won't be easy
To break all the patterns
If I'm not evolving
I'm just another robot
Taking up oxygen
It's something bigger than me
I can feel it beginning
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it
But it keeps on growing
Out of control 
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening
Happening 
Happen, I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it happening 
Happen, I can see it happening
I can see it, I can see it, I can see it happening
It's something bigger than me
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it
But it keeps on growing
Out of control 
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening
Happening 
Happen,  I can see it happening
Happen, I can see itI built a wall so high, no one could reach
A life of locks, I swallowed all the keys
I was petrified, only knew how to hide
They can't hurt me if they don't know me
A full facade made a mirage outta me
Then you came and started digging for a treasure underneath
And you found a better version of me I had never seen
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You got me wide open, now I'm ready
Is this intimacy?
I was a ship floating aimlessly
So camouflaged, was my own worst enemy
Then you came in like a sailor with a heart that anchored me
And every day, I wake up grateful I'm no longer lost at sea
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you'll see
Into me, you'll see
You got me wide open, now I'm ready
Is this intimacy?
Oh, 'cause no one's ever seen me like this
Seen right through the bullshit
I pray that I can keep unfolding
Pray that I can just stay open
Just stay open, just stay open, just stay open
Oh, 'cause you broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you'll see
Into me, you'll see
You got me wide open and now I'm ready
This is intimacyYou sent a text
It's like the wind changed your mind
We were best friends
Yeah, we were building a life
With every kiss and every letter
Every promise of forever
Oh, but you hit “send”
And disappeared in front of my eyes
And now you're just a ghost
You could be so cold
There’s just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there’s just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision’s 20/20
I see through you now
Something has died
Now that I have made up my mind
 I’ll be alright
It doesn’t haunt me at night
'Cause every gift and every letter
Every promise of forever
Now, is out of sight
Like you were never alive
And now you're just a ghost
You could be so cold
There’s just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there’s just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision’s 20/20
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
So, rest in peace
I’ll see you on the other side
And now you're just a ghost
You could be so cold
There’s just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there’s just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision’s 20/20
I see through you
Now, now, now, now, now
Oh, now, now, now, now, now
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
I see through you nowNo one knows, knows where my mind goes
I keep you on the low, I must confess
I've been painting us, the picture makes me blush
My imagination at its best
I could put us on an island
I could put us in a mansion
I could put us in a back seat, yeah
You're anywhere I want you to be
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
No, they'll never know about us
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
As long as I keep you tucked
Tucked deep, deep in my fantasy
'Cause, in reality, we're a mistake
Don't need permission to do what I do to you
When all you are to me's a sweet escape
I could put us on an island
I could put us in a mansion
I could put us in a back seat, yeah
You're anywhere I want you to be
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na 
Na-na-na-na
No, they'll never know about us
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na 
Na-na-na-na
As long as I keep you tucked
I'll keep you
Yeah, I'll keep you, baby
No one knows, knows where my mind goes
I keep you on the low, I must confess
You're someone that I should forget
Oh, woah, oh, yeah
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby 
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby 
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na 
Na-na-na-na
No, they'll never know about us
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na 
Na-na-na-na
As long as I keep you tuckedI'm losing all direction
Slipping into quicksand
I've shattered the illusion
Seen behind the curtain
I'm disenchanted
Dancing on a wire
Juggling desire
Every hit gets harder
When you're fighting without armor
I'm disheartened
Do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender
It's a mind maze, all these head games
Caught in a cage , a complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way
I used to be so sparkling
But now it's not so charming
What used to stimulate me
Now can barely wake me
I'm unresponsive
Will I find salvation?
Some kind of moderation?
Spinning all these plates is
Gonna be a challenge
A delicate balance
So do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender
It's a mind maze, all these head games
Caught in a cage , a complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way
Get out of my own way
Get out of my own way
Get out of my own way
So do I start over, re-rediscover?
I submit to your, your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender
NoYou’re a one-of-a-one, a one-of-a-kind
That you only find once in a lifetime
Made to fit like a fingerprint
A code that clicks open the gold mine
They say one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
When I found you, it was all pitter-patter
Secretly, I hit the lottery
'Cause you're brighter than all of the Northern Lights
You speak to me, even in my dreams
Wouldn't let you go for even the highest price
They say one man’s trash is another girl’s treasure
So if it’s up to me, I’m gonna keep you forever
'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find
Was a phenomenon when you came along
Yeah, our chemistry was more than science
It was deafening, loud like lightning
It was striking, you couldn't deny it
They say one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
The two of us together make everything glitter
'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find
To the bottom of the sea, I'd go to find you 
Climb the highest peak to be right beside you 
Every step I take, I'm keeping you in mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go , so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find
It's hard to find
Oh, it's hard to find
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetimeEverybody's in a hurry, in a flurry
Shopping 'til they're droppin' in the snow
Kids are cryin', dogs are barkin'
Catchin' up with folks we barely know
Sure, it's madness, but it's magic
As soon as you hang up the mistletoe
'Cause you're the reason for the season
No, we don't need to keep up with the Jones
Our love is something priceless
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things 
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling 
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you
So, Mr. Santa 
Take the day off 
Get a massage 
'Cause we've got this one all under control
A little whiskey 
We're getting frisky 
And slow dancing to Nat King Cole
No, we ain't stressin' 
Just caressin' 
Warming up our popsicle toes
Nothing's missin' 
'Cause you're a blessin' 
Yeah, you're the only one I'm wishing for
Our love is something priceless
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things 
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling 
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you
I don't need anything
Take back all the Cartier, and the Tiffany's and the Chanel
Well, can I keep that Chanel? Please?
No, no, no, no
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things 
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling 
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you
Just you and me, under a tree
A cozy little Christmas here with youI lost myself in fear of losing you
I wish I didn't do, but I did
I lost my own, my own identity
Forgot that you picked me for me
But now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They always seem to get the best of me
I found I had to love myself the way I wanted you to
Love me
No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me
Sometimes I wish my skin was a costume
That I could just unzip and strip
But who I am is who I'm meant to be
And it's who you're in love, in love with
So now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They're going to have to take a back seat
I know I have to love myself the way I want you to
Love me
No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me
No more standing in my own way
No more standing in my own way
No more standing in my own way
No more standing in my own way
No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing my feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love me
No more second-guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself the way I want you to love meTonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air

And make sure your champagne glasses are empty
We are now approaching the runway
So get ready for take-off
She’s got that international smile
She’s got that one international smile
That girl’s a trip 
A one-way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she’s got that one international smile 
Catch her if you can 
Yeah, she's so in demand 
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she’s got that one international smile"This is the last time," you say
After the last line you break
It's not even a holiday
Nothing to celebrate
You give a hundred reasons why
And say you're really gonna try
If I had a nickel for every time
I'd own the bank
Thought that I was the exception
I could reroute your addiction
You could've been the greatest
But you'd rather get wasted
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forté
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain
You say it helps you write your rhymes
Whatever helps you sleep at night
You become what you despise
A stereotype-type-type-type
You think you're so rock and roll
But you're really just a joke
Had the world in the palm of your hands
But you fuckin' cho-o-o-oked
Should've been my teammate
Could've changed your fate
You say that you love me
You won't remember in the morning
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forté
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forté
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forté
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go downHe put it on me, I put it on
Like there was nothing wrong
It didn't fit, it wasn't right
Wasn't just the size
They say you know when you know
I don't know
I didn't feel the fairytale feeling, no
Am I a stupid girl
For even dreaming that I could?
If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, yeah
Snow White said when I was young
"One day my prince will come"
So I wait for that date
They say it's hard to meet your match
Gotta find my better half
So we make perfect shapes
If stars don't align, if it doesn't stop time
If you can't see the sign
Wait for it
One hundred percent, worth every penny spent
He'll be the one that finishes your sentences
If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, he'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, oh-oh yeah
'Cause I know you're out there
And you're, you're looking for me
Oh-oh-oh
It's a crazy idea that
You were made perfectly for me, you see
Just like the movies
That's how it will be
Cinematic and dramatic, with the perfect ending, ohh
It's not like the movies, oh
But that's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, you'll come undone
And your world will stop spinning
And it's just the beginningIs Mercury in retrograde?
Or is that the excuse that I've always made?
'Cause I wanna blame you
But I can only blame myself
Yeah, it's easy to throw you under the bus
Or call you crazy, while filling my cup
I say these things to hurt you
But I only hurt myself
Oh, I can only take responsibility for me
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby, to say "I'm sorry" 
I've faced my demons, yeah, I paid my dues
I had to grow up, I wish you could too
I wanted to save you
But I can only save myself
Oh, I can only be the change I want to see
Yeah, to see
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, yeah, oh
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby, to say "I'm sorry" 
I point my finger, but it does me no good
I look in the mirror and it tells me the truth, yeah
Why are these lessons always learned the hard way?
Is it too late to change?
Oh, it takes two 
Two sides to every story
Not just you 
I can't keep ignoring
And I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh
It takes two 
Two sides to every story
Not just me 
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby, to say "I'm sorry" 
I'm sorryYou gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi
'Cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID
But you lost the motel key
Spare me your freaking dirty looks now
Don't blame me
You wanna cash out
And get the hell outta town
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Why are those lights so bright?
Oh, did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis
Why am I wearing your class ring?
Don’t call your mother
'Cause now we’re partners in crime
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S
Ha, and get some cash out
We’re gonna tear up the town
No, don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me, told me, told me
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
That’s what you get, baby
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter
Gimme some cash out, baby
Gimme some cash out, babyYou make me feel like I'm losing my virginity
The first time, every time when you're touching me
I make you bloom like a flower that you never seen
Under the sun, we are one buzzing energy
Let's pollinate to create a family tree
This evolution with you comes naturally
Some call it science , we call it chemistry
This is the story of the birds and the bees
And even when seasons change
Our love still stays the same
You give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
I've flown a million miles, just to find a magic seed
A white flower, with the power to bring life to me
You're so exotic, get my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet
Always on the brink of a heart attack
You keep me alive and keep me coming back
I see the sun rise in your eyes, your eyes
We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies
And even when seasons change
Our love still stays the same
You give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
You love me, you love me
Never love me not, not, oh no
When we're in a perfect harmony
You make me sound like, like a symphony, oh
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh, spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeatI saw a spider, I didn't scream
'Cause I can belch the alphabet
Just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I tape these suckers down
'Cause they just get in my way
The way you look at me
Is kinda like a little sister
You high five your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters
So I don't wanna be one of the boys
One of your guys
Just give a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be one of the girls
Pretty in pearls
Not one of the boys
So over the summer, something changed
I started reading Seventeen and shaving my legs
And I studied Lolita religiously
And I walked right in to school and caught you staring at me
'Cause I know what you know
But now you're gonna have to take a number
It's okay, maybe one day
But not until you give me my diamond ring
'Cause I don’t wanna be one of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be your homecoming queen
Pin up poster dream
Not one of the boys
I wanna be a flower, not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses, not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day
You're gonna wanna make out
Make out, make out with me
Don't wanna be 
Don't wanna be 
Don't wanna be 
'Cause I don't wanna be one of the boys
One of your guys
Just gimme a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be one of the girls
Pretty in pearls
Not one of the boysCan you tell me, who called a race?
Can anyone stay in one place?
And when you get to the finish line
Will you wish for more time?
But see, one day
One day you will
But maybe one day you will find
That you just can’t push rewind
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now
Do you ever think that, we're just chasing our tails?
Like life is one big fast treadmill
And we pop what is prescribed
If it gets us first prize
But you know who I, who I think will win
Are the ones that let love in
Are the ones that take the time
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now
Be here with me now
'Cause the future is right now, right in front on you
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do
Our future is right now, I'm in front of you
Baby, don't blink and miss this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?

Suit and tie, kinda knight, I'mma be her Prince Charming
Let's get trippy and go missing like we on the milk carton
Baby girl, you already know I spoil you like sour milk 
And give you keys to the crib and let you drive the whip
But you gotta make up your mind, you gon' have the pay in to win
Cause soon as you do it in that's what'll betray it she back for revenge
This is more than a case of friends with benefits
She’s Cinderella ’til you lead her on, from a good girl to a wicked witch
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back
Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away 
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back
She's a beast, I call her Karma 
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer 
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart is on steroids, 'cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her 
If you get the chance, you better keep her 
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer 
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleeping beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma 
Damn, I think I love her, shawty's so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair 
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for 
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse 
Are you ready for, ready for 
A perfect storm, perfect storm? 
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going backYou are my hurt locker lover
Keep me walking on a wire
Don't know when you'll blow
So I tiptoe through your triggered mind
You fight me, but I'm on your side
Defeated, now retreating
Why you tryna make me your enemy?
All we really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby, why the ammunition?
I don't wanna be the last one standing
Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I am not fighting anymore
I've tried to pick off your red flags
While dancing on broken glass
Your mind games hit like grenades
Feel cursed, just like the Kennedys
But you somehow get me on my knees
Defeated, now retreating
Why you tryna make me your enemy?
All we really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby, why the ammunition?
I don't wanna be the last one standing
Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
No, I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby, baby
I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
I don't wanna fight no more, anyway, anyway
I am not fighting anymore
 Choose your battles, babe
 Then you'll win the war
 Stop digging your own grave
 When there's so much to live for
 Choose your battles, babe
 'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby, baby
I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then goLay me down at your altar, baby
I'm a slave to this love
Your electric lips have got me speaking in tongues
I have prayed for a power like you
To see deep down in my soul
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower, a desert rose
Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and Heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed
This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all aglow
Like a feather, you make me float
Flying high as a kite on your love
Lost in sweet ecstasy
Found a Nirvana finally
Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and Heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed
This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all aglow
Like a feather, you make me float
You make me float
You make me float
This is spiritual, under your spell
So phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel , all aglow 
Like a feather , you make me float
Oh, oh-oh
You make me float
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, you make me floatYeah-eh, yeah
I can feel a Phoenix inside of me
As I march alone to a different beat
Slowly swallowing down my fear
Yeah, yeah
I am ready for the road less traveled
Suiting up for my crowning battle
This test is my own cross to bear
But I will get there
It's never easy to be chosen, never easy to be called
Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall
I can see the heavens, but I still hear the flames
Calling out my name
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can feel this light that's inside of me
Growing fast into a bolt of lightning
I know one spark will shock the world, yeah yeah
So I pray for favor like Esther
I need your strength to handle the pressure
I know there will be sacrifice
But that's the price
It's never easy to be chosen, never easy to be called
Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall
I can see the heavens, but I still hear the flames
Calling out my name
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don't let the greatness get you down
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don't let the greatness get you down
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?She is a pyramid
But with him, she's just a grain of sand
This loves too strong, like Mice and Men
Squeezing out the life that should be let in
She was a hurricane
But now she's just a gust of wind
She used to set the sails of a thousand ships
Was a force to be reckoned with
She could be a Statue of Liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he’s scared of the light that’s inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark
Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
Can't believe she’s become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a pearl
She was unstoppable
Move fast just like an avalanche
But now she’s stuck deep in cement
Wishing that they never ever met
She could be a Statue of Liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he’s scared of the light that’s inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark
Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
Can't believe she’s become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a...
Do you know that there’s a way out?
There’s a way out, there’s a way out, there’s a way out
You don’t have to be held down
Be held down, be held down, be held down
'Cause I used to be a shell
Yeah, I let him rule my world, my world, oh yeah!
But I woke up and grew strong and I can still go on
And no one can take my pearl
You don’t have to be a shell, no
You’re the one that rules your world, oh
You are strong and you’ll learn that you can still go on
And you’ll always be a, a pearl
She is unstoppableYour Instagram, embarrassing
Living a poser life
Got bigger lips and paid friendships
But losing the light in your eyes
Your only friend, your reflection
Arching your back for likes
I knew you when we'd laugh at them
Now you're the stereotype 
Oh babe, you got high on your supply
You fell in, and now you're trippin'
Yeah, you got high on your supply
Bought the hype and now you're slippin'
You got a head so swollen
You got a vibe so broken
Why oh, why do you keep telling yourself all of them lies
High on your supply
High on your supply
High on your supply
Tell yourself another lie
High on your supply 
High on your supply 
High on your supply
Tell yourself another lie
You're cooler than these sycophants
Who wanna be part of the show
It's hard to hear, but oh so clear
You're not in on the joke
I'm only here because I care
I know it's a lonely road
I knew you when we had nothin'
And that's why I don't blow smoke 
Oh babe, you got high on your supply
You fell in, and now you're trippin'
Yeah, you got high on your supply
Bought the hype and now you're slippin'

High on your supply 
High on your supply
Tell yourself another lieI leave the gas on
Walk the alleys in the dark
Sleep with candles burning
I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and
Running all the red lights
Did I get your attention?
'Cause I'm sending all the signs that
The clock is ticking
And I'll be giving my two weeks
Pick your favorite shade of black
You'd best prepare a speech
Say something funny
Say something sweet
But don't say that you loved me
I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost our grip
Best abandon ship, oh
Maybe I was too pale
Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better
Better luck in the sack
No formal education
And I swore way too much
But I swear you didn't care
'Cause we were in love
So as I write this letter
And shed my last tear
It's all for the better
That we end this here
Let's close this chapter
Say one last prayer
But don't say that you loved me
I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Oh, we've been diagnosed
So let's give up the ghost
'Cause I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost our grip
Best abandon ship, oh
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
OhhAhh
Dressin' up 
Dressin' up 
Ahh
Saucer of milk
Table for two
You wanna pet my kitty?
You're such a dirty doggie
It’s your lucky night
'Cause I'm in the mood, oh, I'm feeling spicy
I'm feeling real naughty
Pick a part, you dream it up
A dark vixen, a Lolita
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you
I can tell you're obsessed by your shortness of breath
Ooh, my Cookie Monster wants a taste test
Be a good boy and I'll show you the rest
Ooh, my little voyeur wants to play explorer
Pick a part, you dream it up
Librarian, dominatrix
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night 
Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you 
You're getting hot, so let's call the nurse
Ooh, I feel a fever
Let's take your temperature
Better behave
Or a police officer will have to hold you down
Give you what you deserve
Pick a part, you dream it up
Use your imagination
Oh boy, I'll be your fantasy
Tonight's the night 
Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you
Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you
Tied tight, tip, teasing
Push, pull, pressure, pleasing
Beads of sweat drip down your neck
Breathing deep, gaining speed, 'bout to peak
Trembling, trembling, trembling
Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you
Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you

I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up for youMy fire through cold nights
The brightest of all lights
You are my home
Wherever we go
We don't need a thing under the tree
You're giving me all I need
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason, you are the reason
My heart can't stop singing
You can't fight this feeling
Unspeakable joy
Ringing through my soul
We don't need a thing under the tree
You're giving me all I need
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday

Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reasonI'm out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high, but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends
Oh-oh-oh
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town, pulling me down
My mother says I should come back home, but
Can't find the way, 'cause the way is gone
So if I pray, am I just sending words into outer space?
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?
Is there a light?
Is there a light?
At the end of the road
I'm pushing everyone away, 'cause I can't feel this anymore
Feel this anymore
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?
Have you ever been so lost?Voted most likely to end up on the back of a milk box drink
Looks like I'm letting 'em down
'Cause $7.75 isn't worth an hour of my hard working time
When you can't afford half the shit they advertise
Oh, I'm worth more than a X
More than a toe-tagged generation full of regrets
Oh, I won't settle, no oh
Oh, I can't settle
I wanna break the mold, wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air, I'm not going down without a fight
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you
Representing you and me
Don't you wanna go down in history?
Rather than end up begging on the streets
Trading under table favors for a place to sleep
'Cause I'm worth more than this
So stop writing prescriptions for more Ritalin
I can focus my attention
I wanna break the mold, wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air, I'm not going down without a fight
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
Don't give up
Don't give in
Build your house on the rock
Oh, not in the sand, in the sand, in the sand, in the sand
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
'Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I-I'm leaving my fingerprints in the endI've learned to slam on the brake
Before I even turn the key
Before I make the mistake
Before I lead with the worst of me
Give them no reason to stare
No slippin' up if you slip away
So I got nothing to share
No, I got nothing to say
Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned, yeah
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned
On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window, oh
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
I'm waving through a window, oh
Can anybody see? Is anybody waving back at me?
We start with stars in our eyes 
We start believing that we belong 
But every sun doesn't rise 
And no one tells you where you went wrong
Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned, yeah
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned
On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window, oh, oh
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for the answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
I'm waving through a window, oh, oh
Can anybody see? Is anybody waving?
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in the forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
When you're falling in the  forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?
Did I even make a sound?
Did I even make a sound?
It's like I never made a sound
Will I ever make a sound?
On the outside, always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window, oh, oh
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
Waving through a window, oh, oh
Can anybody see? Is anybody waving back at me?
Is anybody waving? 
Waving, waving, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-ohHow do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute?
How will I know the right way to love you?
Usually the queen of figuring out
Breaking down a man is no workout
But I have no clue how to get through to you
Oh, I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knocking on wood
Hoping there's a real boy inside
'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in, make you talk
Even pull a string, for you to say anything
But with you, there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
And I can't seem to find your heart
Oh, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool
This one's out of my hands
I can't put you back together again
'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real, but you're not a man
You're just a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy and understand?
But you're not a man
If the past is the problem, our future could solve them, baby
I could bring you to life if you let me inside, baby
It'll hurt, but in the end, you'll be a man
You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real, oh
Toy...
Could you ever be a real, real boy?
Understand, but you're not a man
You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a manIf you want me
The cherry on top, the pick of the pack, the crème de la crop
If you want me, you better do better than that tonight
Oh-oh
If you want me, it takes more than a wink
More than a drink, more than you think
If you want me, you're gonna have to break the bank, tonight
'Cause some don't have the patience
Some call me high maintenance
But you pay the bill, 'cause that's the deal
If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
And don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me
For me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me
If you want me, I'm not a piece of ass
A one-night stand, a storage shed
I think you better walk by, tonight, oh no
If you want me, then stop begging
I don't put out for charity
If you want me, there's no discount price tonight
But I don't need your dollar bills
I just want something real
'Cause nothing's free, except loving me
If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
And don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me
For me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me
If you want me
The cherry on top, the pick of the pack, the crème de la crop

In the kitchen, on the floor
In the middle of the park

And all these little players, acting like they can hate
But they can not
Can't, won't, don't, never will, be real

Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb

'Cause we're all chained to the rhythmRemember when I dove into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee under my skin?
A mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories
Every bone's been broken, but my heart is still wide open
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to
With each scar, there's a map that tells a story
What a souvenir of young love's like jumping out
An airplane riding a tidal wave of an ocean of emotion
My heart rips me wide open
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to
And I cover up these scars
And I can't stop seeing stars
Whenever you're around, around
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to
I can't stop
No, I can't stop
No, I can't stop
Oh, I'm going out in flames
Oh, I'm going down in flames
Ohh
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
Baby, you are the weapon I chooseAyo, Katy! Let’s hit 'em with the remix, baby
Aw, let’s go!
It’s a Friday night, now here we go
I ain’t no stripper, but I work the pole
Bartender, can you pour some mo'?
And I’m so tipsy, coming out my clothes
Fly high, high, high, and I can’t see, so I can’t drive
I party 'til I’m out my mind
I kiss on him, but he don’t mind
Then I wake up in the morn
I got a guy in my bed, like: "Hello, good morn"
Don’t remember how I got him home
But Friday night, it was nice and long
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're going to stop-op, oh whoa
But this Friday night, do it all again
This Friday night, do it all again
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're going to stop-op, oh whoa
But this Friday night, do it all again 
This Friday night, do it all again 
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa
But this Friday night, do it all againI take these turns a bit too fast
Trying to leave you in my past
The CD skips our favorite songs
Our greatest hits just don't belong
I really love to hate this
Love hate, hate love relationships
Are overrated
Over my dead body is how this will end
You said it's over
And I could go for another chance to do this over again
So this is it?
After all we've been through
We called it quits
And I'm about to
I lost my grip
On what little I had left
You said it's over
And I could really go for a cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
Cup of coffee and an overdose
I pop these pills like cracker jacks
And the prize, the glazed eyes
Just watching you react
When you're depressed you sleep too much
I'm not sure if I'm waking up
It's overrated
Over my dead body is how this will end
You said it's over
And I could go for another chance to do this over again
So this is it?
After all we've been through
We called it quits
And I'm about to
I lost my grip
On what little I had left
You said it's over
And I could really go for a cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
Cup of coffee and an overdose
You said it's over
And I could really go for a cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
I stood in line without you, oh
I stood in line without you, I, I-I-I-I
I stood in line
I stood in line without you 
I stood in line without you 
I stood in line without you 
And only, only ever thought about your pretty faceSo break out the frame you’re in
Find that adrenaline
Whatever advice you like
Just save me some tonightIt ain't no accident, evident
I can see your love in a fingerprint
It ain't no mystery, I believe
When a feather falls right next to me, yeah
That's my invisible angel
You might be so far away, but you're so close
We're like the lighting and thunder
A million miles from each other
But so close, yeah
I can feel your energy around me
I can feel your energy around me
I can feel your energy around me
Oh, I can feel your energy around me
I hear you in the breeze, whispering
You're a light that keeps on flickering
It ain't no mystery, I believe
When the chills come rushing over me
That's my invisible angel
You might be so far away, but you're so close
We're like the lighting and thunder
A million miles from each other
But so close, yeah
I can feel your energy around me
I can feel your energy around me
I can feel your energy around me
Oh, I can feel your energy around me
It ain't no accident, evident
I can see your love in a fingerprint
It ain't no mystery, I believe
When a feather falls right next to me, yeahHello to everybody listening to Smile, it's Katy Perry.
I wanna say a very special hello to all of my incredible, beautiful, loyal, encouraging KatyCats all around the world.
Thank you so much for being on this journey with me every single time I put out a record, and for being excited and letting the music, um... work its magic on you, and for showing up at the shows, and all the little places, and for being such an incredible team and a support system that I can always rely on.
I am so incredibly grateful for each and every one of you, and the things that you make online, that make me laugh, and the care that you show, and... all of it, I am so profoundly grateful.
And that's what a lot of this record is: it's, it's a... a record that I never really set out to make, but here we are. You know, after continuing my writing process for 2 years, I would get a little message and just be a vessel for, um... different songs or ideas over the past 2 years, and we had many of them so we felt like, maybe it should be a record. Maybe the record should be called "Smile", and it should be about finding your smile once again.
Um... I don't know about any of you, but sometimes I can feel super low, and alone, and really in my head, and be my own worst enemy, and let that horrible negative voice that trickle, trickles in and out of my, of my head, take over. And, in this past couple of years I've really, um, tried to work on that; and I think a lot of these songs reflect walking through that process, walking through that valley, and coming out the other end alive, and giving live, and, um...
So, I just, I'm so grateful you guys are listening, I, um... I'm excited, I wanna know what your favorite songs are. I have one more song that you're about to hear, um, this song is kind of a funny, sassy song. Definitely don't @ me when you hear it, but thank you once again for listening to all the songs. I hope these songs are encouraging and can lift you out of whatever you're feeling, or give you a little umpfh, or, um... give you whatever you need for today. And if you lost your smile, it helps you find your smile again.
God bless you! I love you.I can't let go of control
I can't let go and not know
Don't know the way ahead of me
One day at a time is all I need
There was a time without trust
There was a time without love
But it took you to show me
That I could hand over the keys
I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map, without a map, without a map
So let's take a walk and get lost
Let's take a chance on finding us
I wanna see the world with you
Every step feels so brand new
It's hard to jump with no net
But I've jumped and I got no regret
You're my co-pilot, yeah that’s right
Now I can just enjoy the ride
I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
But we'll see more without a map 
Without a map, without a map, without a map 
I know we're finally falling
Cause I was giving you half no more than
My hand's in the air while you're driving
This is living, this is living, this is living
Oh it's beautiful, beautiful
Being with you, being with you
I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map, without a map, without a map 
Without a map, without a map, without a map California Girls
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey
Yeah, the one, uh huh
Baby, you're a California girl
Teenage Dream
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
You...
California Girls
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh
The One That Got Away
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one, the one, the one
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
Last Friday Night 
There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbeque
This a hickie or a bruise?
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're going to stop-op, oh whoa
But this Friday night, do it all again
This Friday night, do it all again
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
E.T
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your loving
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
Firework
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moonI'm used to opening my own doors and splitting the checks
He introduced me, was always just the friend
I bought a new dress, he never noticed
Always falling for these bad boys, such a challenge
I'm getting tired, of cleaning up after them
I think I'm ready to be a woman
Oh, love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
You were such a surprise
An unexpected gift
Said I was pretty, and I believed it
Not really used to all this attention
Told myself I don't deserve you
And this is just a phase
Could I get used to, being loved the right way?
I want to argue, but there is nothing to say
Oh, love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
Oh, love, I think I'm ready
'Cause you send me flowers when there's no occasion
Yeah, we talk for hours, you still want to listen
Won't hold it against me if I just need you to hold me tonight
My mother always told me that you'd show up one day
So scared to feel this way
But, love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
Oh, love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
Oh, love, I think I'm ready]
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention 
Since my girl kissed a girl
I guess I can do the same thang
Call me John Witherspoon
Bedroom
Bang-bang
Me and Mrs. Jane-Jane
Watch us do our thang
They say I only name one
But they both got the same name 
They call me Big Daddy, but I ain't Cane/Kane
I got a homeless personality
I can't change
I mean I'm so on top, it's like another world
I am MIMS
A.K.A
Mr. My-Girl-Kissed-Another-Girl
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what
I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
Chorus: Katy Perry
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what
Good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
Repeat Chorus
Bridge: Katy Perry
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to
Deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent
My Girl Gotta Girlfriend, she said she kissed a girl
Won't fill me no details, cause she don't, kiss and tell
Man, I'm in a different world
Is this heaven, is this hell
Some say I'm a lucky man like I fell into a wishing well
Even though I'm livin' well
Somethin' just ain't sittin' well
She gettin' more play than me
Every night, it's a different girl
But I don't mind it
I find it
Somethin' sort of excitin'
My girl kissed a girl, and guess what
She liked it 
Repeat ChorusLightning strikes only once in your life
I guess I'm lucky 'cause I've found myself
In the line of fire tonight
My heart beats like thunder under my skin
And my world speaks in wonder since you appeared
Now we are here
And I could die in your arms tonight
But it would be a shame
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame
Dreams hardly ever do come true
I guess I'm lucky 'cause I've found myself
Waking up right next to you
Oh, and with this raging heart of mine
I'll love you till the end of time
I thank the gods that our stars align
From the ocean floor to the distant sun
Forever more to kingdom come
Have no fear, I'll be burning here
And I could die 
In your arms tonight
But it would be a shame 
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame 
I'll be your 
Ooh, I'll be your 
Oh, I'll be your 
And I could die in your arms tonight
But it would be a shame
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame
Love you again and again
An everlasting fantasy
I'll be your immortal'Cause I'm all that you want, boy

Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile 
Every day, Groundhog Day

But every tear has been a lesson
Rejection can be God's protection
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'
Yeah, I'm thankful

Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile 
I'm so thankful

Finally got back that smile 
I'm 2.0, remodeled
Used to be dull, now I sparkle
Had a piece of humble pie
That ego check saved my life
Now I got a smile like Lionel Richie
Big and bright, need shades just to see me
Tryna stay alive just like I'm the Bee Gees 
A Mona Lisa masterpiece
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile 
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful 
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile 
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I gotta crack a smile, even laugh a while 
Been through a lot, but I ain't backin' down 
See, I came in the game with the flashy style 
Now I'm looking at the wealth that I'm passin' down
I'ma seen the light, it's a pleasing sight
Girl, we even manifestin' when we sleep at night 
Fell down couple times, now we reachin' heights 
Yeah, to be precise, I'ma lead the fight 
Been appointed, light on your life so anointing
Catch me two-steppin', nigga, stressin' is pointless
No need to worry 'cause the truth is here

Grateful 
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally 
Oh oh Look at those beautiful eyes
She reminds me so much of me
Starting out in a brand new world
Who she gonna be?
Will she follow everything that's been said?
Maybe listen to her heart instead
Maybe she needs to be free
She got that from me
What you get is what you see
It's a fantasy life, but it's real to me
And I'll do what I want when I want to do it
I didn't want to live in a box or mansion fault with doors and locks so I never let anyone put me through it
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it 
Give it up to you
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it 
Do it all for you
They all talk, talk, talking at me
Telling me who I am, what to do with my body
And I'll do what I want when I want to do it
Grandma, soon I'll see you too when I overdose, tripping on my shoes
Be the next Queen of Pop
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it 
Give it up to you
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it 
Do it all for you
Give it up to you
Do it all for you
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it 
Give it up to you
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it 
Do it all for you
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
Can't you see?
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
That's all I want from meSummer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one, , the one, 
The one, the one, the one, the one, the one
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away, whoa
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got awayDressed like an Indian prince baby
You lookin fine and so mighty
Hot cold can I take a bit baby
Be your first fruit burst lady
So take it slow
Move my boat
Shake it more
I can take it all
Masam Gunah ah ah
Take it to the next level
If you want another medal
Gunah ah ah
Masam Gunah ah ahI was living in a small mind
With no lifeline
And no messages can reach me from the outside
When I looked out over the horizon
Didn't notice the sun was setting or just rising
Then it hit me
Maybe bit me
Then I knew, quite a few would not go with me
I didn't know exactly where I would be going
But I had to let this river in me flowing
What a ride
When you open your eyes
For the very first time
A real surprise
I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water, every moment I'm alive
I was living on a fault line
The fault was all mine
And this unstable ground found me down half the time
But I had enough
I had to get up
I had to shrug it all off 'cause it's the same old stuff
Then it hit me
You won't permit me
To be an individual
Just doesn't fit me
But I decided that it's going to be living
Yeah, I decided I'm escaping from your prison
What a high
When you open your mind for the very first time
A real surprise
I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water, every moment I'm alive
So long conformity
And ambiguity is a new priority
All it takes, for heaven sakes
Is to figure out the face and learn to separate
I started living outside of the box
Taking my time when I always used to rush
Living outside of the box
Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not
I always knew this day would come
When I broke down the walls for my liberation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive
Oh, living outside of the box
Oh, living outside of the box
Oh, living outside
Ha ha ha
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
Oh, living outside of the box
Of the box, of your life
Of everything that seems nice
Oh, living outside of the boxIf I lost it all today, what would you take?
Would my love be enough to stimulate?
Shit hit the fan, grenades got thrown
Would you still show, oh?
Could you go down with me to the mat?
Could we get back up beneath and eventually laugh?
I, I gave myself a life
I gave myself a life
Oh, I gave myself a life
We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone to ride this ride with me
Can I get a witness? 
Will you be my witness? 
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this
Looking for a witness to get me through this
When you tell me everything, there's no holes
You can scroll through anything, you've got the codes
Nothing to hide, it's all in their eyes
And we just know, oh
I, I gave myself a life
I gave myself a life
Oh, I gave myself a life
We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone to ride this ride with me
Can I get a witness? 
Will you be my witness? 
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this
Looking for a witness to get me through thisI know there's gotta be rain if I want the rainbows
And I know the higher I climb, the harder the wind blows
Yeah, I've gone to sleep night after night punching a pillow
But do you know the darker the night, the brighter the stars glow?
'Cause I am resilient
A full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, oh no
I am resilient
Born to be brilliant
You'll see me grow right through the cracks, yeah
'Cause you're gonna watch this flower grow
Right through the cracks
Aitana
Puede llover por unos mеses
No todo sale como uno lo quierе a veces
Si hubo una herida, la curé solo yo, solo yo, solo yo
Si caigo me hago más fuerte, no es cuestión de suerte, yeah
Somos mejores si together
Estamos open to better
Que el sol siga brillando y que lo malo no me espere
Let's begin a revolution
'Cause love is the resolution
No hay nada que me pueda parar
'Cause I am resilient
Open to better
Won't let the concrete hold me back, oh yeah
I am resilient 
Born to be brilliant
I'm gonna grow right through the cracks
Oh, yeah
Oh, I am resilient 
Born to be brilliant
I'm gonna grow right through the cracks 
Oh, you're gonna watch this flower grow
Right through the cracksHow could I see you when I was so blind?
How could I grasp you when I was far behind?
How could I hear you when I was so deaf?
How could I get up when I had been left?
But You said, don't worry
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, don't worry
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in me
How could I be clean when I was so dirty
How could I be made whole when I was torn apart
Make me whole, make me whole
Make me whole again
But You said, don't worry
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, don't worry
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in me
But You said, don't worry
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, don't worry
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in me
But You said, don't worry
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, don't worry
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in meTold them your dreams, and they all started laughing
I guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens
I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
When did we all stop believing in magic?
Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic?
I'm the long shot
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't it be me?
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down 
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
Tonight I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air
Tonight I'm walking on air 
Tonight, tonight  I'm walking on air 
I'm walking, I'm walking on air 
Tonight I'm walking on air 
Let's go!
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
But they don't know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the ----?
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out 
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisiesAh-ah-ah
I felt it, the wire touched my neck and
Then someone pulled it tighter, I never saw it coming
I started to black out and then someone said good mornin'
I took it as a warning, I should've seen it coming
So now I'll take a chance on this thing we may have started
Intentional or not I don't think we saw it coming
It's all addin' up to something
That as for some involvement, that as for a commitment
I think I see it comin' if we stepped out on that limb
My heartbeat beats me senselessly
Why's everything gotta be so intense with me?
I'm tryna handle all this unpredictability
In all probability
It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause you're the best I've got
So take a long shot
I realize that there is all this doubting
Things we're both scared about that
We'll never see 'em coming, throw caution to the wind and
We'll see which way it's blowing into this fully knowing
We'll never see it coming 'til it's much too close to stop
My heartbeat beats me senselessly
Why's everything gotta be so intense with me?
I'm tryna handle all this unpredictability
In all probability
It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause I'm the best you've got
So take a long shot
Oh, I waited for fact to come of fiction
And you fit my description
I never saw you coming, but we'll make it even though
It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause you're the best I got
So take a long shot
You didn't expect this
Oh, you never saw me coming
You didn't expect this
Oh, you never saw this coming
I take the long shot
I take the long shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot
'Cause you're the best I've got
Oh, I’m taking this chance on you, baby
I’m taking this chance on you, baby
I’m taking this chancePreacher man walked into the bar and he said
He said "Hey girl, can't you walk a mile straight?"
Father, I'm torn and I'm selling my soul
To the rhythm, the beat and the bass
'Cause I can't confess my rock and roll ways
'Cause I'm so possessed with the music, the music he plays
I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love, with my rock-rock god
Preacher man took my hand and looked in my eyes
He said "Hey girl, can't you live your life right?"
Father, things aren't always so black and white
Don't cast the first stone 'cause I'm not alone
And it's not like I'm hurting anyone
But I can't confess my rock, my rock and roll ways
I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love, with my rock-rock god
I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love, with my rock-rock god
No, I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
I chose a path and I'm not looking back
And I'm sorry if I left the angels cryin' over me
I can't stop my feet from dancing to the sound of his drum
Oh no, I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love, with my rock-rock god
Preacher man, preacher man, oh
Preacher man, preacher man, oh
Preacher man, preacher man, oh
Preacher man, preacher man, oh
'Cause I'm gone, gone, gone 
Gone, gone, gone
Yeah, I'm gone, gone, gone I've got people to see
Places to go
Deadlines to meet
A reputation to up hold
It's like a ton of bricks
Breaking on my back
It’s like
The force of gravity
In full effect
I got money to burn
And I'm on the sake
They bet their bomb on me
Cause I'm their ace of spades
I feel the walls
Getting closer
I'm like a bomb
With all red wires
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means
I'm gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means
I'm gonna be
A diamond
It won't ever bend
A diamond
Cause there ladies
Best friends a diamond
But there
There has to be more
Than what these pirates
Are gambling for
If not for the push
I’d probably be a pebble
If not for the pressure
I’d be forgotten forever
Just another stone
Skipped upon the water
Drowning fast before
The other failures
I don't wanna be
A distant memory
On your wall
Just another cd
That you burned
And never bought
Am I not worth it to you?
After all that drama
That we've been though?
A diamond
It won't ever bend
A diamond
Cause there ladies
Best friends
A diamond
But there
There has to be more
Than what these pirates
Are gambling for
Ooh ooh  diamond
I've gotta be a diamond
(I'm a diamond in the sky
With you standing by
Now catch me if I fall)
Oh  oh  oh
Yeah yeah yeah
I'm a diamond in the sky
With you standing by
Now catch me if I fall
Into the arms of a coma
All this pressure
I've got pressure

What the fuck?Through this skin you see
My heart
Through this laughter you feel
My pain
Even through this mask you see
My face
For You are the only one who really knows just who I am
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
You search me
Growing up never comes
Easily
In Your hands, You're the potter
Molding me
Then why do I wear this mask and play this game
Of hide and seek
When You are the only one who really knows just who I am
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
My Father, my Father
You are my Father, oh, and I am Your child
And you hear my cry, even at the midnight
And you search me

And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
The mysteries of who You are
The mysteries of who You areI've never asked to define our time
It's understood
So crystal clear
When your eyes lock mine
We so connect
But we're almost scared of it
So no strings attached
Is where it's at..
For the moment
So just relax
Baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night 
Undo my dress, let down my hair
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
Yeah, I play cool
Like i've met a hundred yous
And for tonight
You're just right
To be the one I use
But you break me down
I forget the games I play
Oh you wrap me up
In your arms and I just.. melt away
So just relax
Baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night 
Undo my dress, let down my hair
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
Oh if I could freeze this moment
In my heart shaped locket
Wear you around my neck
So you won't be forgotten
I would, I would
Oh if I could tell you everything
I feel for you baby
Spill my heart out on the floor
And have it be reciprocated
I would, you know I would
So just relax
Baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night 
Undo my dress, let down my hair
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
Oh baby relax
Oh baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
Undo my dress, let down my hair (Oh if I could freeze this moment in my heart shaped locket
And let's just wear you around my neck so you won't be forgotten
Spend the night, spend the night. I would, I would)
Woah oh ohYou're such a poet
I wish I could be Wesley Willis
My words would flow like honey, sweet and laid on thick
You're so edgy
You dont even need a rhyming dictionary
I wipe my hands on your jeans, cause they are more distressed
So they say--you got O.C.D
And they claim you can barely read
But you say "Don't bother me with all of your reality"
But it could be so simple
Life should be that simple
I wish it were just so simple
But the point's been missed
You've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems
So what, you're a genius
But you've got a lot to learn
Like the time you lost your apartment
Cause you bought too much Vuitton
You park in a loading zone
You sleep with the lights all on
You cross your i's and dot your t's
All it goes to show
That it could be so simple
Life should be that simple
I wish it were just that simple
The point's been missed
We've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems
I'm not saying that it's a piece of cake
Just take a moment to re-evaluate
The possibilities
The situations
The opportunities
That are waiting
Oh, the possibilities
Oh, I
That it could be so simple
Life should be that simple
I wish it were just that simple
The point's been missed
We've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems
We could talk all day
About your eccentricities
What I mean to say
Oh, is that I need you listen please
And focus on life's simplicities
So don't be afraid to strip it away
Cause at the end of the day
It's still as simple as it seems
It is all so simple
Just deal with itThey know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the...
A tiger, don't lose no sleep

What the...You know it's crazy, cause nights like this
Would start out with a little private party
You sneak me in your mom's house
I know I mighta spilled my drink, but
Really wasn't tryin' to spill my heart out
I mean it started as a conversation
I was really tryin' to get my thoughts out
But then we make moves and we make plans
Had the whole thing mapped out
See, you were gonna go to college
And to pay for bills I'd figure the job out
And you knew I had to say it, but them day's gone
Now I moved on and you switched phones
Hopefully reincarnation will bring us back to the place we belong
Summer after high school when we first met
We make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
Its time to face the music
I'm no longer your muse
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
I'm falling for you like dominoes
From the top of the hundredth floor
Look out below Geronimo
Tryin' to get behind the closed doors to your soul
Why'd you have to end the show
We had such a beautiful plot
There was still more story to go
Now look, I'm not insinuating that
You're some type of fair weather player
But even if the whole world falls over
I wouldn't be aware of a glacier
I just wanna see you wake up
Doing your hair in the mirror with your makeup
Then, maybe in the next lifetime we could make up
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got awayEvery week's the same
Stuck in school's so lame
My parents say that I'm lazy
Getting up at 8AM's crazy
Tired of being told what to do
So unfair, so uncool
The day's too long
And I'm holding on
'Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's time when we're gonna
Breakout
Let the party start
We're gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
Feels so good to let go, oh-oh 
Hanging out's just something we like to do
My friends and the mess we get into
These are the lessons that we choose
Not a book full of things we'll never use
The day's too long
Yeah, I'm holding on
'Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's time when we're gonna
Breakout
Let the party start
We're gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
Feels so good to let go, oh-oh 
Wish it would never end
Spending time with my friends
Oh, with my friends!
Breakout
Let the party start
We're gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
Feels so good to let go
Breakout
Let the party start
We're gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
Feels so good to let go, oh-oh I used to know you when we were young
You were in all my dreams
We sat together in period one
Fridays at 8:15
Now I see your face in the strangest places
Movies and magazines
Yeah, I saw you talking to Christopher Walken
On my TV screen
But I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
I used to work at the record store
Now I work for my dad
Scraping the paint off of the hardwood floors
The hours are pretty bad
Sometimes I wonder where you are
Probably in L.A
That seems to be where everybody else ends up these days
And I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you, yeah
I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you, yeah
Thank you, thank youI turn my head, there's nothing there
All I own is my thoughts for my fears
I close the door to keep out the bad
I plug my ears to keep out these fears
And I cry
So hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold, hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold me
I listen to these voices
Or is it this house that's giving me chills
As I lie upon this little girl's bed?
Who's at the door? Who's walking near?
Or has my imagination spilled?
This little girl all grown up still fears
Oh, and I cry
So hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold, hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold me
Where can I go, where can I hide
From these evil sufferings?
Oh, these images painted on my walls
They say there's a place that I can
Hide in the shadow of your wings
Oh Lord, bring me to this place of refuge
No more tears
So hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold, hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired, and tired and tired, and tired and tired
Oh, so tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold me, hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold me, oh, oh
I am so tired
Oh Lord, I'm so tired
Oh, oh
Hold me
Me, meLiving in fear
Is not what you had
In mind for me
But holding to you
Is so hard
I cling to what I see
In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You
Here in this haze a distant light
Seems to draw me near
But in the shadow of my doubt
My faith just disappears
In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is YouI know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees 
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek 
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top

A simple song, a photograph of mine
To show this public eye what I have to offer
I may not have a PhD
Or speak in eloquent philosophy
I'm nothing more than simply me, you'll see
What I am trying to say, hey
I'm just a babe in so many ways
I'm still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through
I don't regret, I'm not ashamed
That I haven't yet begun to speaketh ways 
Oh perhaps some day but for now I'm grateful
To be a part of the family tree
While The Man upstairs does His work on me
It's a job that may take eternity to complete
Just when I've learned all I can
Those growing pains up and kick on in again
Still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through
Time after time, one more time and again
Will it ever end?
It's the lessons in our lives that make us wise
But young or old, I am told it's the same
Oh, these growing pains never go away
So I'll just keep on trying
What I am trying to say, hey
I'm just a babe in so many ways
Still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through

Time and time again
My faith won't fail
For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall and He'll will pick me up
For time and time again
He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall and He will, He'll pick me up
For time and time again
My faith won't fail
Oh, for time and time again
My faith won't fail
Oh, for time and time again
My faith won't failThe weight of my words
Are like feathers from a bird
My mouth, it moves, but you won't hear a thing
'Cause I've dug myself deep
I managed to fit both my hands and feet
All my little white lies
Smell like a big old bucket of bleach
In one ear and out your other
So lock and key
You won't open up for me
So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us
And it feels like you're in China
And I am in Peru
Whenever I am sleeping next to you, oh
We can hear the crickets singing
Oh, all throughout the night
Oh, boy can't you just get used to something so right?
And sure I confess
I'm a mess, I'm a mess of mistakes
But please count to ten before you go and throw it all away
So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us
'Cause if you give up
Then what am I supposed to do?
All of our dreams never will come true without you
So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not giving, giving, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not giving, giving, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, baby, don't give up on this loveLeg 1 — Europe

Under the shooting stars?
We made a wish were together forever
And let nobody tear us apart
And how fun was that ride down to Mexico?
We took a chance on those road side tacos
And we got sick by the side of the road
And the fall came
And we had that big pot lot party;
And your little sixteen year old brother
Spilt wine all over my carpet
And I got mad, you thought it was funny
I stayed mad all winter;
It's so sad
A thing like that
Becomes such a splinter
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Is the end of the road
For us it's too, late
Let the credits start to roll
I'm almost twenty-three
And I'm barely hanging on
I can't keep crashing couches
And going to sleep at dawn
And when were you going to take me somewhere that I can dress up?
Where we can act grown up
Do you ever wanna clean up?
We share a car, you thought it was okay
You couldn't have cut it closer
I'm sick of it, this is it;
And now the party's over
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same, and
The story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Is the end of the road
For us it's too, late
Let the credits start to roll
Someday, you'll make, some girl, happy;
I know, you'll get though
You'll know, just what, to say, to do;
Because I showed you
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Is the end of the road
For us it's too, late
Let the credits start to roll
Let the credits start to roll
Oh, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yeah
Oh, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late
I guess the driveway; will be the end of the roadTwelve noon
Watch her sleeping in your room
Why can't that still be me?
Two o'clock and I'm still driving 'round your block
Feeling a little crazy
You'd change your number and move to the suburbs
You run, but you can't hide
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords
But I like showing up at your place
So surprising
That look on your face
I'm underneath your street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever
So weeks pass and I found myself another catch
Someone who loves me equally, yeah
The tables turn and you're not happy
When you learn he's moving in with me
He bought me a big ring, we moved to the city
Now you won't stop calling
'Cause you always thought that you'd have your plan B
Now you're showing
Up at my place
Not surprising
We both play this game
You're underneath my street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
You're right outside my window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever
La la la la
La la la la
Forever
La la la la
La la la la
You'd change your number and move to the suburbs
You run, but you can't hide
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords
But I like showing up at your place
So surprising
That look on your face
I'm underneath your street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever
I'm underneath your street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window, throwing rocks and starting fights

Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb

Its always predictable
Postpone your broken dreams
While flipping through the pages of a magazine
You gotta take the highs with the lowsMy mama warned me about boys like you
It’s the reason I wear these steel toed boots, yeah
And let me give you a little piece of advice
My papa packs heat and he won’t think twice, yeah
Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Too much trouble better stay away
Grab your hat, better get gone
But if you stay, you’ve been warned
I’m a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart 
Be careful what you start!
I’m a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart 
It’s gonna leave a mark!
Well, every now and then I make a man break a sweat
Watch him work overtime on my wristbands 
Cause I’m the kinda girl that you wanna show off
I’ll tell ’em all your friends with a southern drawl 
Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Sweet as a peach, impossible to tame
Fingers on the trigger and you’ll be to blame
Cause if you stay
I’m a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart 
Be careful what you start!
I’m a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart 
It’s gonna leave a mark!
I’ll ride where the wind wants to take me
Leaving lovers in the dust every city
'Cause my heart was like a ghost town baby
And now I've met a man that breaks me
My mama warned me about boys like you
It’s the reason I wear these steel toed boots
I’m a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart 
Be careful what you start!
I'm a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart 
It’s gonna leave a mark!
Straight for you heart 
I'm a bullet and I’m headed
Straight for you heart 
It’s gonna leave a mark!Yeah, you guys ready?
TEEさん

Uh-huh, here we go!
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy, your enemy
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back
Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine

妖異の魔女だと 言われても
どうにも止まらんぞ 分かってても
狂喜の愛ほど 抑えられない衝動
こいつが bueno 
ゴージャスなそのlips
とろけそうなkiss
視線の先の 男どもを
一目で招く
富士山芸者も脱帽
この国の宝と並ぶほど
見てみろ マジbeautiful
ゴージャスな美貌で

あの日から感じてる
逃れようとしても
その魔法にヤられる

Are you ready for, ready for 
A perfect storm, perfect storm? 
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine 
There's no going backGot a call from my friend
She saw my picture again
In a magazine
We laughed out loud
'Cause she said, "Remember when this was all a silly dream?"
Now I wake up every day
In a different city
A smile on my face
Somebody pinch me
She said "All the world's a stage"
But girl you know
Those cameras and lights
Won't ever change me
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
It's amazin' to hear people singin' along
Hear the radio playin' my song
I still get butterflies
Still get nervous inside
In the spotlight
Now every now and then
On a Friday night, cruisin' down to the dive bar
We waste the night away
Spend saturday sleepin' in late
Yeah, those were the good days
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
And even when I'm miles away
I'll always have the roots from where I came
'Cause when it all fades away
My home will still be the same
Ooh
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I...What are you lookin' at?
I saw this coming from a mile away
I saw a crack in the egg
A little rip in the page
I found your necklace on the floor
Underneath the bed
Where you said
I was the only one
You thought I'd cry
You thought I'd lay down and die
You thought there's no getting over you
And all this time
You've been having your fun
I've been having some fun too
Cause' it takes one, to know one
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here, heartbroken
But the knife is in your back
You left your suit, you left your tie
And looked me in the eye
And swore that it was business baby
And when you left I got a call
That started it all
And now it's not your business ba-by
You thought I'd cry
You thought I'd lay down and die
You thought there's no getting over you
But all this time
You've been having your fun
I've been having some fun too
Cause' it takes one, to know one
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here, heartbroken
But the knife is in your back
You're such a wreck
The cutest accident
Makes so much sense
You'll come back to me, oh
And I'll let you
Hey
Huh
You're back
Cause' it takes one, to know one
Congrats you've met your match
You think i'd lie here, heartbroken
But the knife is in you're back
Cause' it takes one, to know one
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here heartbroken
But the knife is in your back
------------------
PS: This is my very first annotation so it would be nice of you if you left a feedback about it. :]I'll blow you a kiss from across the room
I’ll let it miss so you don't assume
Please tell me that you want me, you need me
Doesn't matter if you don’t believe me
I have no one to call me baby
Sure is sad no one calls you lately
I try to run but I don't know how to get there
Keep on running you're going nowhere
You fear the sunrise, you can dry your eyes, your crocodile tears
I just need a man who will stay
You can save it for a rainy day
Won't you help me get my life on track?
I'd oblige but you stabbed me in back
Ride with me, I'm headed south
I can't believe a single word from your mouth
You and me are like biscuits and gravy
Now I know that you're crazy
You fear the sunrise, you can dry your eyes, your crocodile tears
Can’t believe a word you say
You can save it for a rainy day
Had to tell you not once, but twice
You need to take your own adviceI saw you at the grocery store
Oh you both looked happy
Picking out the usual
She's a carbon copy
Of everything you lost, of everything I'm not
I guess you just forgot how to pick 'em
If she's the one I've heard about
I'm disappointed
If she's the reason why you left
I'm not impressed at all
Well this looks like the end
Yeah, I hope we can still be friends
Congratulations
Let me be the first to wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse that creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me again
And again
And again
And again
Well, someone had to tell the truth
And I'm always honest
I read you like an open book
And it's obvious to me
She's just the one between, heading no where fast
Sure it's gonna last forever
Let me be the first to wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse that creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me again
And again
And again
And again
Oh, you wish
You wish
You wish

Hello?
Hi, it's me, can I come over?
Sometimes I want a shot of your Novocaine
I think I found the switch that turns off the brain
Locate the black hole that I can jump right through
'Cause my ears, they won't stop ringing
I won't stand another pick up line
Oh, my heart, it will stop beating
If I don't see you tonight
I'm throwing down some drinks, and then speed dialin'
I think I'm gonna wake you up
I stutter when I speak, but I'm not lying
I think I want you way too much
These things I confess, they just lead to a dysfunctional love
Just don't hang up
Just, just don't hang up
Running away is not the solution
My head's not straight with all this pollution
Electronic gadgets add to the confusion
So, are you on your own?
Or should I take a rain check?
Now am I going home?
Or will I cry my eyes out?
I'm throwing down some drinks, and then speed dialin'
I think I'm gonna wake you up
I stutter when I speak, but I'm not lying
I think I want you way too much
These things I confess, they just lead to a dysfunctional love
Don't hang up
There wouldn't be so much to say
If I wasn't in this all to stay
Is it too late
For us to communicate?
I, I, I, speed dialin'
I, I, I, speed dialin'
I'm throwing down some drinks, and then speed dialin'
I think I'm gonna wake you up
I stutter when I speak, but I'm not lying
I think I want you way too much
Don't hang up
'Cause I want you way too much
Out of luck
Because you're too far for me to touch
Don't hang up
Because I need you way too muchThis was big for us
Forever changing you and me
Allow me to be ambiguous
Though I can't stand ambiguity
I'll beat around this burning bush
Trying to put the fire out
When all the shoving came to push
The words just stayed stuck in my mouth
'Cause it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone
Ba da da dum
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum
So we might lose
But I'm glad I didn't leave
I wear my soul on my shoes
If not my heart upon my sleeve
If I'm not allowed to speak aloud
Of what you really mean to me
Then'll type it bold when I spell it out
I T S L O V E
'Cause it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone
Ba da da dum
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum
So why do I hesitate for my cocoon to break?
Second guess every move that I make
This was big for us
Changing you and me
Oh, somebody tell me
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your life for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum
Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Yeah, yeah, oh yeahI took advantage of you
A stepping stone to my pedestal
When you had enough of it
I said 'Fine, good luck replacing this'
Cause I seem strong and independent
Self sufficient, confident
And I'm like Mercury rising to the top so selfishly
The better half of me was you
I'm like a hive without a bee without you
I gotta find you, gotta remind you
That two is better than one
So please accept my apology
Cause I'm feeling like a branch without its tree
It took me a fall to really see
That you're the catch I want to keep
Cause I get weak thinking about you
Living without you life has no value
Baby, come back to me
Cause you're the only missing piece
Cause the better half of me was you
I'm like a hive without its bee without you
I gotta find you, gotta remind you
That two is better than one
Ooh, it took a little earthquake
To appreciate the stability you've given me so consistently
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The better half of me was you
I'm like a bird without its wings, without you
I gotta find ya, gotta remind you
That two is stronger than one
The better half of me, oh it's you
I'm like a heart without its beat without you
I've gottafind ya, gotta remind you
I promise you that I'm going to try to
I'm gonna love you because two is better than oneDid it seem to disappoint you, living alone?
By the banks of your dilemma, out of control
No one seems to give the answers, that you wanna hear
What you'd give to find a welcome here
Miles and miles of lies behind you, those were the days
So many lives you'd hope would guide you, help you find a way
Now it seems to your surprise that they left you lying here
What you'd give to dry these bitter tears
Did it come naturally? You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say I love you
Heaven waits the hours of silence, finds you on your knees
Broken in a sweet surrender of peace
All the years of searching for a love you didn't know
Now you've finally found a welcome home
Did it come naturally? You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say I love you
I love you, I have
And I always will
Did it come naturally? You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say
Did it come naturally? You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say I love youI won't, no, I won't apologize
I will not, will not subscribe
Don't ask me, ask me to normalizeTold them your dreams, and they all started laughing
I guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens
I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
When did we all stop believing in magic? 
Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic? 
I'm the long shot
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't it be me?
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house 
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
When did we stop believing? When did we stop?
When did we stop believing? When did we stop?
'Cause I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me? Oh, me
Oh, me, yeah
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisiesOh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you've found it
Slow motion, sparks you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys oh, yes they will
They don't want to define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills, then get cold feet
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow, so if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants
And your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight
I can't cook, no but I can clean
Up the mess you left
Lay your head down
And feel the beat as I kiss
Your forehead, this may not last
But this is now
So love the one you're with
You wanna chase
But you're chasing your tail
Quick fix won't ever get you well
'Cause I feel the distance between us
Could be over with a snap of your fingers
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, sweetheart
Put the bottle down
'Cause you don't

Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all
Your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white
Christmas with you
Jingle Bells
All the way, all the wayIf You came by me
Would I crown You my King
Or brush You off as though
I really didn't see
If You walked by my side
Would our souls then be unified
I swore Your name
Would never be denied
But I took up this hammer
And laughed at all Your slander
And pierced Your hands
With the nails of blasphemy
How could I do this? I don't know
Said something forced me to it, so
Spit in Your face and passed You by
But time and time again
I'd live that life of sin
I knew it hurt you bad
But I wasn't ready to give in
Maybe someday
But not this day I said
I wanted to live my life
I was willing to pay the price
But I took up this hammer
And laughed at all Your slander
And pierced Your hands
With the nails of blasphemy
How could I do this? I don't know
Said something forced me to it, so
Spit in Your face and passed You by
('Cause I'd forgotten those words
Your name won't be denied)
But looking into my eyes
I knew You felt this heart's cry
I needed You
Bad my life was oh so sad
But looking back at all this pain
This guilt, this strife
Would You take it all away
If I were to give you back my life?
But You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee

With a crown of thorns

Can you tell me, who called a race?
Can anyone stay in one place?
And when you get to the finish line
Will you wish for more time?
But see, one day
One day you will
But maybe one day you will find
That you just can’t push rewind
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now
Be here with me now
'Cause the future is right now, right in front on you
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do
Our future is right now, I'm in front of you
Baby, don't blink and miss this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now
Part II: Love Me
I lost myself in fear of losing you
I wish I didn’t do, but I did
I lost my own, my own identity
Forgot that you picked me for me
But now, I don’t negotiate with insecurities
They always seem to get the best of me
I found I had to love myself the way I wanted you to
Love me
No more second-guessing
No, there’s no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I’m gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I’m gonna love myself the way I want you to love me
No more standing in my own way
No more standing in my own way
No more standing in my own way
No more standing in my own way
No more second-guessing
No, there’s no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I’m gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I’m gonna love myself the way I want you to love me
No more second-guessing
No, there’s no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I’m gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I’m gonna love myself the way I want you to love meWe're looking in the same direction
But you don't see what I see
Just a half moon in your perception
It looks full to me
Oh my head is caught, caught in clouds
But your buried so, so far down
You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down
The way your pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down
Your words can pollute the future
So you should choose carefully
Cynical is a natural born killer
If it were up to me I would say
Lets get you all medicated
So we can get dedicated
You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down
The way you're pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down
This is not a race
This is the relationship
But you take the cake at being the worst in it
Try and keep me grounded
You took my faith and nearly drowned it
This is not a test
This is the relationship
You are the best in being Mr. Negative
You weigh me down
You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down
The way you're pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down
You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down
The way you're pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down
You weigh me down Greetings, loved ones
Let's take, take, take journey
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees 
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek 
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love, in love, in love, in love
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sex  on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Toned, tan, fit and ready
Turn it up cause it's getting heavy
Wild, wild, West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns 
The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just the king and a queenie
Katy, my lady 
Lookie here, baby 
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you representin' California 
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California, California girls
California, California girlsIf the fish swam out of the ocean
And grew legs and they started walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking
And the stars fell out of the sky
And my tears rolled into the ocean
And now I'm looking for a reason why
You even set my world into motion
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
I look up into the night sky
I see a thousand eyes staring back
And all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black
I feel the weight of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation
Then most of my life isn't real
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-ooh-oh, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-oh
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and goldIt felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl 
I kissed a girl 
Kiss...
I kissed a 
I kissed a 
I kissed a girl, I kissed a girl just to
I kissed a girl, I kissed a girl just to
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight

Didn't you know if nothing changes
Nothing changes
Time's up
Promise this time I'm getting off
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train
We wait for it
Even when it's gone
We've surfed the wave
Now we've hit the shore
And we've squeezed the fruit
Till there's no more juice left
We're both so good
Good at keeping up the lie
Yeah-heah, yeah-heah
Hey but no one's got to
Die, we can
Get it in prospective
Kiss my lips
Life is what we make it
Time's up
Promise this time I'm getting off

Nothing changes
Time's up
Promise this time I'm getting off
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train
We wait for it
Even when it's gone
As I'm waving you goodbye
I want you to smile
Save a picture in your frame
File it right next to my name
I'm willing to die
For love willing to try
But not willing to lie for love
I know that this cake's already baked
Now its burning, burning
We can
Get it in prospective
Kiss my lips
Life is what we make it
Time's up
Promise this time I'm getting off
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing changes
Nothing changes

Even when it's goneI know you know my boyfriend is out of town
So have a drink, let's talk it over
So many things I shouldn't be saying now
You know, I like my boys a little bit older
I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
All my girls are nowhere to be found
They all split when I'm in trouble
But I'll tell you all my secrets if you stick around
The undercover lovers under the covers
I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-ove
I just wanna use your lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-ove

Trying to stop my head from spinning
Too much to drink, not making sense
It's been a while since I've been with someone new
That I can't stop the way I'm feeling
As you leave, please could you just close the door
Now that our love affair is over
You're exactly what I was looking for
We'll find a shoulder to cry upon
I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

Singing this song, song, song, song, songWhen I wanted you, you would not reciprocate
When I needed you, you would always show up late
But things have changed, and I've got the upper hand
You can run and I've got you eating out of my hand

When I got my period, you were inconsiderate
But tables turn, and it's great to be on top
Got you trained to appreciate the good that you've got
That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
I say where and when it happens
That's more like it, that's more like it

I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in

Eat with your hands, fine

Got you running back for seconds
Every single night
Sweet tooth, no tooth fairy
Whipped cream, no dairy
Got her hot light on, screaming, "I'm ready"
But no horses, no carriage
Under candle light
We can wine and dine

Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
We're all chained to the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song

All the highs and lows and in-betweens
And now you see me and just say, "Hey"
Isn't it weird that you've seen me naked?
We had conversations 'bout forever
Now it's 'bout the weather, okay
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk
Isn't it wild that I know your weakness?
And everybody at the party thinks
That you're the best since sliced bread
And isn't it awkward I got a new somebody?
And honestly it'll probably be a while before we can just be friends
I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget

Let's take a journey
Greetings, loved ones
 Let's take a journey
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees 
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek 
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

California girls man
Hahahaha 
I really wish you all could be California girls
California girls man
I really wish you all could be California girlsI won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
Cause my roots, they run deep, oh
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I will on my angels
They say...
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
I know it, I know it
And be transformed
’Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "you're out of time."
But still, I rise
Don't doubt itWe woke up late, said goodbye
Now I'm standing outside on the street
I walk through the city, I'm laughing
In case staring down at my feet
If I look up, the sky might fall
Open up and pull me in
I feel like an angel who's fallen
But I just got to have the taste of original sin
Damn, can you feel it?
Damn I can't believe it
Damn you got me feeling good
Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good
Two minutes later, I'm counting
The seconds and hours to go
Working a sweat out of bed
Just the thought of you is making me glow
I got the fact that you get it good
Now back up and just leave it alone
I'm walking on air cuz your crunk
Now I'm going home to do it all again on my own
You got my tongue, it's so tied
My eyes are open wide
And my hair is standing up on my skin
And I keep saying:
Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good
Walk through the door, and enter your room
Cause this whole world lies but you tell the truth
Do you think I'm gonna give you up?
You never gonna let me down
Your love is like an ocean and I'm starting to drown
You got my tongue, it's so tied
My eyes are open wide
And my hair is standing up on my skin
And I keep saying:
Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good
Damn, I can't believe it, I can't believe it
Ooh you got me feeling good good goodYeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile
Every day, Groundhog Day
Goin' through motions felt so fake
Not myself, not my best
Felt like I failed the test
But every tear has been a lesson
Rejection can be God's protection
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile
I'm 2.0, rеmodeled
Used to bе dull, now I sparkle
Had a piece of humble pie
That ego check saved my life
Now I got a smile like Lionel Richie
Big and bright, need shades just to see me
Tryna stay alive just like I'm the Bee Gees
A Mona Lisa masterpiece
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile 
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm gratefu
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile 
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile 
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile 
I'm so thankful
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally
Smile 
I'm so grateful
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally
Smile You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I'll let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream

Never needed anyone to send me off to sleep
And I know I said go slow, but I can't hold back no more
Got a premonition this ain't gonna be a fling
You make the weekend feel like a year
Baby, you got me changing
24/7, I want you here
I hope you feel the same thing
I want you to be the one that's on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
I want you to be there on a Monday night
Tuesday night, every night
Are you gonna be the one that's on my mind?
3-6-5, all the time
I want you to be the one to stay
And give me the night and day

Ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Are you gonna be the one? 
Give me the night and day
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh
Are you gonna be the one?

Love it when you come back and can't take it when you leave
Got me fantasizing our initials already
And I wanna just let go, falling deeper than before
Say that you are ready, lock it up in a heartbeat
I want you to be the one that's on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
I want you to be there on a Monday night

I guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens
I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me

'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
Hey, hey
Oh, cover me in daisies
Hey, hey
When did we all stop believing in magic?
Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic?
I'm the long shot
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't it be me?
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out 
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
Hey, hey
Oh, cover me in daisies
Hey, heyThey know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the?
A tiger don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions from a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated, I got your number
'Cause you're a joker and I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning, lay 'em up like
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket
Your game is tired, you should retire
You're 'bout cute as an old coupon expired
And karma's not a liar
She keeps receipts
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the...?
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket
They know what is what
Do they know?
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the...The leaves were falling, I was seventeen
We'd been locking lips, grabbing hips, smoking cigarettes
We took a drive in your 1990 the hand me down
From out of town, I was California
Oh, my legs were not shaved
And you had dirt between your fingers
They told us to behave, but hey
It's not like riding a bike
It's not like flying a kite
It's not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like taking a bath
It's not like having a laugh
It's not like reading a map
It's nothing like the first time
I had seen it in the magazines
We would change the channel on the TV screen
'Cause it's such a sin what ya did to me
Straight to hell is what they sell if you done the deed
Oh, but what could be so bad?
Oh, if everyone is guilty
I guess we want what we can't have
'Cause I've heard...
It's not like riding a bike
It's not like flying a kite
It's not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like taking a bath
It's not like having a laugh
It's not like reading a map
It's nothing like the first time
Do you remember? Do you remember?
Do you remember? Do you remember?
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time
It's not a walk in the park
It's not a shot in the dark
It's not a juvenile crime
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like tying the knot
There's no connecting the dots
And in case you forgot
There's nothing like the first time
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like reading a map 
Oh ya, you give me laugh
There's nothing like the first timeI won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
Cause my roots, they run deep, oh
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
But still, I rise
Don't be surprised, I will still rise
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in your veins
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed
But still, I rise
Don't be surprised, I will still rise
But still, I rise
Don't be surprised, I will still riseTeenage dream
Teenage dream
Teenage dream
You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Teenage dream tonight
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back

Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonightYou’re walking through
A lonely Street
Looking at the moon
It light up your ocean eyes
Please Save Me Some Tonight
While you’re walking
My eyes get you
They don't want to let you go
You’re like a vital blow
You have all you want
The people watching us
We both think “fuck off”
While we're kissing
It seems that we are chained
We were made for each other
So break out the frame you’re in
Find that adrenaline
Whatever advice you like
Just save me some tonight
Baby save me some tonight
Baby let yourself love
Don't be afraid of feeling
Be my love
Your indifference is hitting
Like a Demon
Killing me, from the inside
Be my light
Light my way
Throw the hell
I’ll go from you hand there
You have all you want
The people watching us
We both think “fuck off”
While we're kissing
It seems that we are chained
We were made for each other
So break out the frame you’re in
Find that adrenaline
Whatever advice you like
Just save me some tonight
Baby save me some tonight
Don’t let alone
Here in the darkness of my soul
I need you baby
By my side i need you
To heal the wound
That an ¨unconditional¨ love open up
You have all you want
The people watching us
We both think ¨fuck off”
While we're kissing
It seems that we are chained
We were made for each other
So break out the frame you’re in
Find that adrenaline
Whatever advice you like
Just save me some tonight
Baby save me some tonightYeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile, that smile
That smile, that smile, smile, that smile
Back that smile, that smile, smile, that
Finally got back that smile, that smile, smile, that smile

Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile
Finally got back that smile
Finally got back that
Finally got back that smile
Finally got back that
Every day, Groundhog Day
Goin' through motions felt so fake
Not myself, not my best
Fеlt like I failed the tеst
But every tear has been a lesson
Rejection can be God's protection 
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile, that smile

'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally
Oh 
I'm so grateful 
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally
Finally got back that smile
Finally got back that
Finally got back that smileIsn't it strange that you used to know me?
All the highs and lows and in-betweens
And now you see me and just say, "Hey"
Isn't it weird that you've seen me naked?
We had conversations 'bout forever
Now it's 'bout the weather, okay
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk
Small talk
Now there's nothing left but small talk
Small talk 
Now there's nothing left but small talk
Isn't it wild that I know your weakness?
And everybody at the party thinks
That you're the best since sliced bread
And isn't it awkward I got a new somebody?
And honestly it'll probably be a while before we can just be friends
I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk
Small talk
Now there's nothing left but small talk
Small talk 
Now there's nothing left but small talk
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers 
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
We were, we were lovers
Now there's nothing left
Now there's nothing leftComparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one
I still got the seed
You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes
You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test
He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth, oh
He pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into...
You're the best
And yes, I do regret
How I could let myself let you go
Now the lesson's learned
I touched it, I was burned
Oh, I think you should know
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What you would do if...
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Won't you walk through
And bust in the door and take me away?
Yeah, no more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes I want to stay
Oh-oh, woah-oh, woah
StaySwish, swish, bish

What the f...I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
Cause my roots, they run deep, oh
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
I will still rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...
Oh, ye of so little faith

Victory is in your veins
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed
I will still rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise
’Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "you're out of time."
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise
I will still rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, riseIt was quite a shameless summer for my lover
When the gloom was full of horrors
And the moons were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met
I miss our shameless summer sweatYou're so gay, and you don't even like boys

Let's take a journey
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees 
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek 
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sex  on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep ​*horn honks*​
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh
You could travel the world 
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us 
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out

Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis
Why am I wearing your class ring?
Don’t call your mother
'Cause now we’re partners in crime
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me
Me...
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love

You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic
This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wave length
And be there when you vibrate
For you I'll risk it all
All

We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one

So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away"You know, sometimes you can be blinded by your extreme emotions. I definitely was looking for answers, during that time when I wrote that song, and yeah, I was depressed and sad, and there were thoughts, but there were never actions, thankfully. But I wanted to share that side of my story, because I know there are so many other people out there that have gone through things like that, and you always feel like you’re the only one going through that. You walk out the door, and you see someone you know, and they ask you how you are, and you just have to say you’re fine when you’re not really fine, but you just can’t get into it, because they would never understand. Well, then comes along a song that speaks to you, that makes you feel like ‘Gosh, I can get through this if she can get through this, I can get through this.'"C'mon, woo

Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile 
Every day, Groundhog Day
Goin' through motions felt so fake
Not myself, not my best
Felt like I failed the test
But every tear has been a lesson
Rejection can be God's protection
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'
Yeah, I'm thankful

I'm 2.0, rеmodeled
Used to be dull, now I sparkle
Had a piece of humble pie
That ego check saved my life
Now I got a smile like Lionel Richie
Big and bright, need shades just to see me
Tryna stay alive just like I'm the Bee Gees 
A Mona Lisa masterpiece

All I could say
Is what do I do?
What do I do?
We're broken
But I can't
Throw us away
The video
Of our vacation's
Chewed up in the drawer
Beside me
She thinks I never got
To watch it
I'm so glad
I made a copy
The sky
Got bitter twisted
Just like you and me
I miss it
You snap it
Bend it
Burn it
Then you find
That you can't fix it
Fall back on whatever
Still remains
Breaking you in
Breaking your heart
I was taking it all
And I tore you apart
Breaking me in
Breaking my heart
And the damage was done
But I took what you got
We were breaking' it
Smashing' it
Taking' it
Loving' it
Hating' it
Driving' it home
And now I'm all
Now I'm all alone

Katy Perry claims the record for the most weeks at No. 1 in the 21-year history of Billboard's Pop Songs radio airplay chart all to herself, as "Dark Horse," featuring Juicy J, spends a fourth week on top, upping her career count to 46 weeks at No. 1. With her latest frame in the lead, Perry passes Mariah Carey, who's totaled 45 weeks at No. 1
Here's an updated look at the acts to spend the most time at No. 1 dating to the Oct. 3, 1992, launch of the Nielsen BDS-based tally, which measures the most weekly plays at mainstream top 40 stations:
Weeks at No. 1, Artist
46, Katy Perry
45, Mariah Carey
32, P!nk
32, Rihanna
29, Ace of Base
26, Maroon 5
25, Christina Aguilera
23, Beyonce
23, Boyz II Men
23, Nelly
Perry has earned her record-breaking feat courtesy of 11 Pop Songs No. 1s, also a chart best-sum, which she shares with Rihanna.  Of Perry's 11 leaders, "Horse" is the eighth to rule for at least four weeks. She set a personal best when "California Gurls," featuring Snoop Dogg, dominated for seven weeks in 2010
On its way to granting Perry her latest piece of Pop Songs history, "Horse" last week set the mark for the most weekly plays  in the chart's archives. It passed the 16,065 plays that her prior topper, "Roar," drew on the Oct. 19, 2013, chart
In addition to its pop airplay success, "Horse" topped the all-format airplay/sales/streaming-based Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it's her ninth career No. 1. It's sold 3.5 million downloads, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The song continues to build at multiple radio formats, bulleting at No. 2 on Rhythmic Songs, No. 8 on Adult Pop Songs and No. 28 on Adult Contemporary
All charts, including Pop Songs, will refresh on Thursday  on Billboard.comYou

        You look so funny to me
When you pretend to be something you could never be
You try to make us think you live a tough life
But you've got your daddy's money so you'll always get by
There's a little bit of hip missing from you're hop
You're from beverly hills stop pretending you're not
You're the full ten baby all of the way
You will never be south central LA
Got your Air Force Ones and your Sean John jeans
Way too big hanging down to your knee's
Can you tell me what's up with the "what up G's"
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be
You've got your twenty inch rims bouncin' up to the club
If you're not keepin' it real you're gonna get no love
Never seen the streets, never smelled them once
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be
We all know you've got it made
Drive around town in you're escalade
No matter how you fight to fix it right
You're just a trust fund baby on the inside
I'll admit for me life hasn't been too tough
I've got my own problems but they ain't that rough
You can act the part you can wear the clothes
You can talk the talk everybody knows
Everybody knows yeah...
Got your Air Force Ones and your Sean John jeans
Way too big hanging down to your knee's
Can you tell me what's up with the "what up G's"
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be
You've got your twenty inch rims bouncin' up to the club
If you're not keepin' it real you're gonna get no love
Never seen the streets, never smelled them once
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be
Just hanging with your homies, out on a Friday night
Turn up the bass it's time to ride
Now don't forget the shorties all up in the club tonight
Time for you to show me all you're ice ice
Baby boy
Got your Air Force Ones and your Sean John jeans
Way too big hanging down to your knee's
Can you tell me what's up with the "what up G's"
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna be
You've got your twenty inch rims bouncin' up to the club
If you're not keepin' it real you're gonna get no love
Never seen the streets, never smelled them once
You're just a wanna be, you're just a wanna beThis was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight

Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
 Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me

 Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you, I'll risk it all, all
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison

You're so supersonicSummer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one
The one
The one
Woah, oh, oh..
The one, the one
I should've told you what you meant to me
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one

Part II: Thinking of You
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your

'Cause all this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world

'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, thinking of youThe story we paint is the wish of a dream
A hard journey traced by hope
How the alignment of the stars
My heart longs for something that couldn't stay
A true lover of the future burned in the sand
Like a scene where I just saw it in my dreams
Birds fly to the ocean
Just as we are genuinely free
My heart keeps beating
As the waves break
And the winds carry
All the memories that make me return to you

        Everybody's reading the book
About the boy from Bethlehem
Story of a kid who would change
The world with the palm of his hand
So bring me some toast before you go
Because I'm beginning to see that the story is quite okay
Cuz I've seen movies, and I wear the shirts
But what does this story really say
From my love didn't come from fantasy
Or to play glamorous roles, for the
Company man that we've all made him out to be
Is not what the story has told
So entertain me if you want to
But I've heard it all
If you feel the need to say more than what's been said
But I'm sure Love can stand on His own
But I'm sure Love can stand on His own
Still she sings her top 20
About the boy she doesn't even know
Written by a man they call money
He's winning birds while saving souls
It's of the man, the marketing plans
And a new Mercedes for his 17 year old wife
He's really diggin' on the girl with the top 20
Ain't it funny
For my Love didn't come to win Grammys
Or to be the king of rock n' roll, for the
Company man that we've all made him out to be
Is not what the story has told
So entertain me if you want to
But I've heard it all
If you feel the need to say more than what's been said
But I'm sure Love can stand on His own
Oooh, entertain me if you want to
I'm sure Love can stand on His own
I'm sure Love can stand on His own
Love can stand on His own
So turn your eyes from the glow
And remember the SonYou gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi
'Cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake I.D
But you lost the motel key
Spare me your freaking dirty looks now
Don't blame me
You wanna cash out
And get the hell outta town
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Why are these lights so bright?
Oh, did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis
Why am I wearing your class ring?
Don’t call your mother
'Cause now we’re partners in crime
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right

Que tu te decides
Tu ne m'auras plus comme avant avec un battement de cils
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out

Si tu ne veux pas que je te quitte
Je ne te vois plus comme avant
Tu ne me va plus comme un gant
Je ne vais pas faire semblant
Surprends moi, ou va t'en

I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel likе I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn mе on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on

Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans

And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue

I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go

She knows

For you to say the words you say
And sometimes it's the little things that
That come to get you
I can feel the distance
Baby, maybe you can save me
This is real love, real love
I can see the problem isn't
Hanging onto any piece of you love, you love
Now don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life and never, ever let go now
Don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me
I'm gonna, gonna live this life
This life but never, ever let go now
Oh, oh
Save me when I rip the cord
And hang on so I don't get bored
And pull me when I kiss the ground
It's so nice to know you
Go 'head, you can chase the light
Kick back when it gets too bright
'Cause my world is another world
I'd, I'd like to show you
I can see the problem isn't
Hanging onto any piece of you love, you love
Now don't say whatever you say
As long as you say you love me

Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me, told me, told me
You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi
'Cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake I.D
But you lost the motel key
Spare me your freaking dirty looks now
Don't blame me
You wanna cash out
And get the hell outta town
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now

Why are these lights so bright?
Oh, did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis
Why am I wearing your class ring?
Don’t call your mother
'Cause now we’re partners in crime
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Waking up in Vegas

Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S
And get some cash out
We’re gonna tear up the town
No, don’t be a baby

Remember what you told me
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is

Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter
Gimme some cash out, baby
Gimme some cash out, babyI used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee
I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero
You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high, but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Caught in the eye of the hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town pulling me down
My mother said I should come back home, but
Can't find the way, 'cause the way is gone
So if I pray, am I just sending words into outer space?
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever, have you ever, been, yeah
Oh yeah
Oh
Is there a light?
Is there a light?
At the end of the road
Cause I'm pushing everyone away, 'cause I can't feel this anymore
I Can't feel
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so, so lost
So lost, oh yeah
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so...
Have you, Have you ever been, been so lost
Da da da da da dum
ThanksI hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don’t eat meat
And drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it’s almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You’re so sad maybe you should buy a happy meal
You’re so skinny you should really Super Size the deal
Secretly you’re so amused
That nobody understands you
I’m so mean 'cause I cannot get you out of your head
I’m so angry 'cause you’d rather MySpace instead
I can’t believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup, and
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like

Hey, oh yeah
Give it to me
Oh, you're so...

I wish you would just be real with me
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like

Penis
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Thank you!Hey
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you, baby
Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed, I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it, it, it, oh!
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
Cause us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent
It's innocent, yeah
Oh, oh, oh yeah
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
Thank you!I will not philosophize about the meaning of life
Let's take no time 'cause the teasing isn't right
Let's skip the foreplay
We know were gonna do it anyway
Cause all I'm selling is...
Sex, sex
On your radio, selling is
Sex, sex
Just like a machine
Have you seen my video?
Look at me I'm dancing in slow-mo
And the ad campaign I'm bathing in champagne
Cause I'm a lady
Good for one thing maybe
And all I'm selling is...
Sex, sex
On your radio, selling is
Sex, sex
Just like a machine
A machine
Yeah, a machine
All I'm selling is
Sex baby
Sex baby, sex
On your radio, all I'm selling is
Sex
Just like a machine
Will you be my sugar daddy if I promise to behave?
Then you can have me, but you'll be digging your own grave
Oh, it's not worth it, I've already done my circuit
All I'm selling is, all I'm giving is, all I'm selling is...
Sex, sex
On your radio, selling is
Sex, sex
Just like a machine
I'm selling it, sex
On your radio
I'm selling it, sex

Part II: Last Friday Night 
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're going to stop-op, oh woah
But this Friday night, do it all again

        I was raised on sundays and one ways
A room with glass stained views
Picture perfect washed in the words
That were my only truth
It's not that I'm letting you go
Oh, but now I'm all grown up
And I need to know
I'll make mistakes
But if that's what it takes
Then it's worth starting over again
'Cause I can and I will
And I'll do what I feel
When the world tries to break me, I'll bend
'Cause I can
Scared of asking too many questions
Scared to make the choice
From the beginning, you'll be my ending
If you can hear my voice
'Cause it's not that I'm giving you up
Oh, your name is engraved, oh
And so is your love
But I'll make mistakes
But if that's what it takes
Then it's worth starting over again
'Cause I can and I will
And I'll do what I feel
When the world tries to break me, I'll bend
'Cause I can
Oh, always
There's always
Times we have to leave
Oh, but I know that
When I need you
Oh, you will rescue me
Oh, I'll makes mistakes
But if that's what it takes
Then it's worth starting over again
'Cause I can and I will
And I'll do what I feel
When the world tries to break me, I'll bend
'Cause I can
Oh, when the world tries to break me, I'll bend
'Cause I canYou hate the sand between your toes
I like the beach on a sunny day
I like pink margaritas
It appears you like beer
I like a foreign accent
You just say "What? What the hell they say?"
We got different perspectives
Night and day, but that's okay
Sometimes I'd like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
You like to fight in silence
I like to scream while I'm breaking plates
You like the heavy metal
But I like songs to sing along to
Sometimes I like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
And I will, but you won't
And I do, but, but you don't
We won't budge either way
But we like it, we like it
Sometimes I'd like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree

        It's been dope
It's been sick
It's been funky
It's been hip
Look at my wings
They're fantasy, they're fairy
Now you are looking at me
You don't have 'em, I'm the boss
I'll give you where it hurts
With all my fairy dust
You roll crazy like a dice
Cause of my wings, my glitter
And oh my mind!
It's been dope
It's been sick
It's been funky
It's been hip
They say I'm nobody, I'm not worth anything, but I know that's just envy
With my wings they will go crazy
Cause' they shine more than those lazy
And if they don't get to buy my heart, then I don't consider 'em a f*cking threat
FunkyRita, my love
I have always loved you since the day we met

It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi
'Cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake I.D
But you lost the motel key
Spare me your freaking dirty looks now
Don't blame me
You wanna cash out
And get the hell outta town
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis
Why am I wearing your class ring?
Don’t call your mother
'Cause now we’re partners in crime
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S
And get some cash out
We’re gonna tear up the town
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
You told me
You told me, yeah
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Oh yeah
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter, yeah
Gimme some cash out, baby
Gimme some cash out, baby
Woah, oh, yeah
Thank you!Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one
I still got the seed
You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes
You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test
He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth, oh
He pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your...
You're the best
And yes I do regret
How I could let myself let you go
And now, now the lesson's learned
I touched it, I was burned
Oh, I...oh you should know, baby
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I, I was looking into your
Your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh, won't you walk through
And bust in the door and take me away
No more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes I'd like to...
Stay, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeahYou come over, don't talk
Turn the TV on off
Disconnected, unaffected
Better take the call
Show you pictures of my hometown
A pin could drop from miles down
What's the use in trying to be a girlfriend
When I know just what we are
There's nothing in common
Except the bed we lay on
I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between
You're a habit I can't break
Disaster to eliminate
What part of no do I not understand?
When you're no good for me
Cause I know we will never
Be some kind of forever
I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between
Cause I'm the girl who needs it all or nothing
How did we become a one-night stand?
Hanging on the thread just isn't something
That I want in the end, no
Oh, it's empty in between
You come over
Yeah, it's over
Oh, we know just what we are
I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between
Cause I'm the girl who needs it all or nothing
How did we become a one-night stand?
Hanging on the thread just isn't something
That I want in the end, no
Oh, it's empty in betweenDays like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drain me down
That was then and this is now
Now look at me
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Now look at me, I’m sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won’t never put me out again
I’m glowing, oh whoa
You can keep the dog for me
I never liked him anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah, yeah, except for me
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, noWe are the ones that walk to fire
And people say, "Don't touch," yeah, people say, "Don't touch"
We are the ones that never listen
We can't get burned enough, we can’t get burned enough
And there's no boundaries
Can ever hurt you, you can never hurt me
And we're so unique for falling in love and letting love be
You've got to take mе to that place
You let your guard down, yeah, you lеt your guard down, yeah

But you better choose carefully
'Cause I'm capable of anything
Of anything and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfеct storm
'Cause once you're minе, once you're mine
There's no going back
Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away, don't walk away
It's in the palm of your hand now baby
It's a yes or no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it up to me
Up to me, give it up to me
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back
She's a beast
I call her Karma
She eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart was on steroids
'Cause her love was so strong
You may fall in love
When you meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her
She swears by it but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma
Woo! Damn I think I love her
Shawty so bad
I'm sprung and I don't care
She got me like a roller coaster
Turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil' mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going backOh my god, were you looking at her butt?
You're such a good boy and let's keep it that way
You're going out with your guys tonight
And you can flirt boy, shop the windows displays
They'll get you drunk, best behave, alright?
