It bothers me when the gods get to actin' like the broads
Guess every team doesn't come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y'all
I just ask that when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all
Don't be duckin' like you never wanted nothin'
It's feelin' like rap changed, it was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge
Me and my G from D.C., that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million-dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge
Me and my man Oliver North, that's how I roll around

I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty Ms
Kobe my nigga, I hate it had to be him
Bitch, you wasn't with me shootin' in the gym
Tell Lucian I said "fuck it," I'm tearin' holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix, and take her ass out in public
Ordered her the filet, told 'em, "Butterfly it, she'll love it."
She used to soda and nuggets, she really just out here thuggin'
I'm just hittin' my pinnacle, you and pussy identical
You like the fuckin' finish line; we can't wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that
Young rich motherfucker gettin' mine off rap, with my niggas

From the hoopty coupe to that Ghost, dawg 
Pigeons on the roof like Ghost Dog 
Dwight Howard on the post, dawg 
My niggas got the powder through the post, dawg 
Watch the body tilt when you hit the head 
Niggas lost mills tryna beat the feds 
Ten grams off my last 250 now 
Big-ass crib, 250 down, damn!
Gave my nigga Max 7-5 
Then gave my nigga Penthouse another 30 
Fuck it, got me thinkin' like I'm 7-5 
Damn, nigga ain't even seen 30
Huh, I ride for my niggas, dawg

Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you
The highest form of my admiration
I ain't no connoisseur but I'm, kinda sure you will admire my taste
And before the sun graze ya, I'm tryin to see how deep you are
And believe me shorty I ain't talking 'bout no intimate conversation
I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable

Let it all drip baby
If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby
No more talking baby
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, damn, my baby tastes the best
I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex
Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check
Leave my cars at her crib, I'm just stuntin' on her ex
Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess
I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh 
Sex all night, couple shots of CÎROC
Crib on the water, got LeBron up the block

Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate
And I won't ever rest, we meet at the peak of your mountain
Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you
And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you
Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia
Hol' up, showing off some Agent Provocateur
Rushing you out your drawers though patiently get you off
Hate when they be too anxious though, hate when they be too dull
Like to go deep but I hate to get too deeply involved
How sweet is you?  Let me see some proof
Fuck making pussy talk, I like to make it sing a tune
All we need is we, we don’t need no room
Right now I’m trying to eat, and we don’t need a spoon

J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League
Riding to the music, this is how we do it , all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing
When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow what's on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space
Elroy Jetson: I'm somewhere out in space
In my 2-seater she's the one that I would take, wee
Riding to the music, this is how we do it , all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the, Aston Martin Music, Music

Caught in the life I can't it let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing
Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box
Mr. KFC, VVS's in the watch
Living fast where it's all about that money bag
Never front, you take it there, it ain't no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100
Riding to the music, this is how we do it , all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music
Would've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go, whether that's right, I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came -
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urgin’ all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back
Aston Martin Music, Music
Aston Martin Music, MusicI don't got a single sober vein in my body
I don't got a single sober vein in my body
Don't apologize, I quite enjoy messy
I see that bottle after bottle got you goin' crazy
And doin' shows after shows got me so lazy
So ride it out for me, and take it off for me
It's a good vibe, good vibe, good vibe
Don't you ever threaten niggas with a good time
She wanna buy a dream, I said I don't sell it
But she can rent it for a night, I don't mind, open wide
Cause all this fame, I earned it, I might as well use it
Private elevator goin' straight to my unit
All my niggas 'round me, gettin' kickback pussy
All my killas 'round me, all be hiding in Stussy
Can't nobody stop me, used to be homeless
Now that penthouse at the Ritz where my home is
Tour bus like a National Geographic
Bitches runnin' wild gettin' faded in the bathroom
It makes me smile, it makes me smile
Cause I got it
It makes me smile, it makes me smile
Cause I got it
All the pain, sweat and tears, just to get a piece
But now we got it
Man look at the kid now, can nobody stop me?
I don't got a single sober vein in my body
Fuck her like a thug nigga, young nigga, new Ferrari
Old money, I just 'fraid the Lord with us
Condo blow money, like it's all dope money
Come short wet niggas, like a speed boat coming, oh Lord
Mo money, mo money, these rich young niggas ain't ever know money
Belaire running down the Rollie on her arm
Pinky ring six-hundred, what you know about it
I'm the champ, baby, Real Deal Holyfield
Got the bitches, want it dirty, went and bought the crib
25 mil, I'm doing 25-to-life
100 acres, keep my shooters all through the night
Every chandelier ran a nigga, one-mil
20 chandeliers motherfucker who real
I just wanna show her what I live like
Wearing a white Birkin on a winter night
Fuck a Birkin, now she in the Bentley
That's when she went and tatted double M G
Now our bond deep, deeper than the rap
She give me brain she a mastermind to be exact
She a mastermind to be exact
I give her game and she give it back
Sip syrup so I fuck slow, sip more I wanna fuck more
Gotta grind 'till your eyes close,
Stay strapped 'till the trap close
They scream Maybach on the cell blocks
All my dawgs who used to sell blocks
They say the niggas in the jail talk
How your homies commissary fell off
What make it worse he get an elbows
25-to-life dead wrong on the cell phone
It makes me smile, it makes me smile
Cause I got it
It makes me smile, it makes me smile
Cause I got it
All the pain, sweat and tears, just to get a piece
But now we got it
Man look at the kid now, can nobody stop me?
I don't got a single sober vein in my bodyIf Michael Jackson came alive right now
He'd ask you to smoke one for him
So in his honor
You niggas Spud Webb, coming up short
Think you're Dee Brown, jump if you want
I put it on my momma and her very last nerve
Ricky Madoff everything I deserve
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
Do the math, I'm a motherfucking G nigga
It's all on me now, as you can see now
I'm gon' get this money and I will not be denied
Been shittin' on you fucks a long time, time to pee now
When you finish first they hate you worse, startin to see now
I'm at the round table, where your seat at?
Where your plate, where your lobster, where your sea bass?
We ain't never left, acting like we back
You should see us now taking pictures acting like we rap
This the circle that'll murk you, blackout, short circuit
Somebody show them square ass niggas the first exit
This here reserved for soldiers most definitely
So watch what you say and where you step more carefully
If I fall in the field and ain't no more air for me
Pour some on the ground and put one in the air for me
Tell my enemies fuck 'em, they know already but fuck 'em
Tell 'em again with a middle finger and a chuckle
You don't know nann nigga, nope, uh uh
This famous that'll still throw copper
Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle
Fire the ganja back up
Throw some blow in my tobacco
Then crank the Lac up
One match left, this the last turn
Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn
I'mma earn 'til the last court adjourn
'Til the last gavel drop we gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked
I'm part of the small percentage of niggas who make it out the ghetto
But niggas tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
It's funny how they come for me when they see me living comfortably
But when I was broke and sleeping on floors they ain't want nothing from me
My future's so bright but my past so ugly
And I just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me
Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
So I accept what got me here, reflecting in this rocking chair
All this space created, all that hard work it got me here
So what I look like telling a nigga that I shouldn't be here
Power to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear
And I'll be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair
Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
Out in the open all alone, I felt the coldest air
Secluded in my thoughts in fear
No one to talk to, no one there
Not even a voice, not even an ear
No one alive, no one to care
Now I got a power circle, now I'm on a power trip
And they calling me counterfeit cause I ain't gave a coward shit
Stone me, throw me a pile of shit but you won't pull me out of it
It's funny how it comes full circle
Now they wanna be a part of the power circle
They wanna be a part of the power circle
May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And what's life without grind
Those niggas, yo' niggas?
Hope those niggas real as mine
May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And what's life without grind
Those niggas, yo' niggas?
Hope those niggas real as mine
There's a difference between underrated and hasn't made it
Once you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred
There's no applause for ya and success is hard for ya
There's enemies, envy, with green my niggas -- lawnmower
And I'm on tour, Jordan 4's, Tom Ford
And I ain't thugging, they clapping at me, a encore
Got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy
I give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety
Shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertaining
And my inner sanctum need real estate I'm out my cabeza
Jealousy's for the weak, you ain't happy I made it
I be feeling like brother Malcolm just out of the Nation
Allah got us cause if we hollered a lost numbers
I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers
So shut the fuck up and listen, fuck all them stuck up musicians
My circle small but regardless, my circumference official
My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
They gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us
I'm so elusive, so my niggas be goin' through it
Guess it's a wrap when your co-defendant make soul music
Cash rule the world -- at least it do with girls
At least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts
If they real, then they real -- my niggas deserve it
And we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle
We don't deal with weak squares in this power circle
I'm like welcome to the power circle
I came a long way, I started with a powdered circle
Clique full of real niggas that'll probably murk you
Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
Lotta talking, lotta Tweeting, 'til you hear that chopper speaking
Kill my dog, I kill your dog, we tied even, I'd believe it
If you see it then you got it, nigga never give up
Cause if you grindin' you gon' be rich before you can look up
My cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up
Cause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hookup
And still make the profit
The streets say I'm the hottest and a nigga still modest
I'm just being honest
Back to the wall, never let 'em get behind us
Mac in my draws fitting right in my designers
Look at my persona, I dreamed it, woke up and conquered
And there was commas after commas, I eat 'em like Benihanas
Put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster
And the lobster over the table, power circle a mafia
Just talkin' money, talkin' money what you talkin' bout?
Probably talkin' bout us, we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about
Look inside the eyes of the last Mohicans survived
You won't last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon don't compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
I'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in YSL
Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell
Hell's fire, I never lie, you will never grind
I know the priors they running by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms
When they heard that Ohio State gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
When they day breaks and you earned them stripes
And you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
It's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
Now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm
On a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind
Now one fake, I'm a realist in strive, I'm a billion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gon' try to put a finish in my shine
But pussy, we'll hurt you
Life in the power circle
Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on, am I right?
Tried to warn you niggas
I tried to warn you niggas
It's too late now
Double M-G
Too much cake
Too much power
Too much respect
Bow down, nigga
Ugh!Yeah
I'm home now, it's over now, so...
Yeah
She got a thing for Chanel vintage that dropped before she could speak English
Do you love me or love seekin' attention, I mean which one is it?
You keep callin' me ya twin, but twins ain't this different
Mentally I'm already on next year, that's some 20/20 clear vision
You sayin' let you finish, I ain't tryna hear it
I'm all for spiritual liftin', but I don't fly Spirit
I'm all for findin' happiness, but down to die serious
All smiles, Kevin Durant trials
Had to blow it on the court, I must have blew a milli'
I'm walkin' on all charges, that's my new Achilles
I know they love to rock a check, but who gon' do it really? Really?
My depositions never surface
Tanenbaum know the logo on the jersey, it's gettin' purchased
Ten years in and y'all yet to hear my most impressive verses
Paid the cost to be the boss wasn't even my most expensive purchase
Trust when I say I'm never on the shit they assumin' I'm on
Tales about me are like corridos in Culiacán
Sashimi from Saito, you know that man two Michelin Star
Postcard from Grace Bay, sendin' my distant regards
Vision wasn't mine, told my niggas the vision was ours
Still a part of shorty even if we've been livin' apart
Roxx'll do you filthy for me soon as I give him the nod
Meanin' he'll blast for me like puttin' the 6 with the God
Hop on a float to show the city the one they appointed
The one that's rebuildin' schools and feedin' the homeless
Hang with my niggas, but sometimes I be tryna avoid it
'Cause they'll get to poppin' out of place like they double jointed
Goals was the top of the pyramid in this shitty world
"I gotta get the most of everything" is the axis on which it sit and twirls
Point blank period, like a City Girl and then I bring it back to 50 world
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, it's too late
This different right here, yo
I was nominated, never won a Grammy
But I understand, they'll never understand me
Lot of lives lost, but I never panicked
Lot of lines crossed, I never did a Xanny
A hundred room mansion but I felt abandoned
Love makin' love, but where will love land me?
Jealous, so their bitches be actin' like they sleepin' on us
But they speakin' on us, jewelers quote us even numbers
Still blowin' smoke as angels float above us
Love givin' back, but will they ever love us?
Chanel in the mail, FedEx from Pharrell
And what I got for sale just sit on the scale
Triple beam dream, a buck on the shades
I really seen things give mothers the shakes
I really bought cars for women on face
I know it seem odd, but money amazin'
College loans really did fuck up her credit
Discover cards, look back, I know she regret it
But we keep pushin', keep our foot on the pedal
In the mirror she a blessin', rebukin' the devil
Livin' on the edge, she keepin' me level
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever 
Slip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers
Everywhere we go, we create a dilemma
Coming to America, really the set
I'll let your soul glow, I'm keepin' you wet
All my cold Decembers, I know she remembers
Forgiveness for a sinner, but is it that simple?
Holdin' on your hands, your body's a temple
Fly you out to Cannes, ménages with bitches
Lobsters and the prawns, thought you was Spanish
Bottles for the Don, our parties the biggest 
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late 
Had a dream she was singin' to me like Gladys Knight
True love in the projects is called paradise
All your niggas left, you wasn't actin' right
But honesty itself a small sacrifice
My money bag heavy, got me packin' light
You movin' funny, can you fill my appetite?
Niggas' conversations, a lot of it false
He own condos right over Carnegie Hall
Speak about your cars, but all of 'em parked
Your niggas' money light, come out of the dark
You really are my type, that's not a facade
One of the reasons why I write, we got a synopsis
I'm always at the top of barbershop gossip
After further thought, better not knock 'em
Allocate some dollars to go out shoppin'
Bitch, we on the real, it's time to stop talkin' 
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late I just wanna be the one, I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down
I just wanna, I just wanna fly, I'ma show you tonight
That I'mma put it on you baby, take you past the sky
Wake up in the world and I'm just another nigga
Call it public housin' when you next door to the killers
On the corners, it gets better as you go
Grind that mothafucka 'til it's yellow brick road
Free as a bird, spoken word in my verse
On my knees prayin', niggas shootin' in the church
Wake up out my sleep in another cold sweat
I lived on Billboard, where the fuck to go next?
Go against the odds, youngin' go and get a job
Another country boy they want back on the farm
So far from my goals but I'm close to my kids
Thug cry for Mac Dre throwin' up the Thizz
I just wanna be the one, I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down
I just wanna, I just wanna fly, I'ma show you tonight
That I'mma put it on you baby, take you past the sky
I just wanna burn
Uhh, well let me light one for my problems
Smokin' on that loud, pumpin' up that volume
Get it crackin' like an eggshell in this mothafucka, make omelettes
Get a bad bitch that posts up like comments
They don't know what I been through, don't know what I'm goin' through
As long as I get through, that's what I look forward to
Richer than a bitch, but still I can't afford to
Let these niggas play with me; need to be remorseful
I swear I got that silencer on that Mac 9 and I kill these niggas with silence
My head stay in the clouds, I really feel like a giant
Can't trust none of these niggas, I murk one of these niggas
Then bury one of these niggas, still got dirt under my fingers
Ain't a threat, that's a bet
Cause they coming at my neck like the best a man can get
But to make a long, story short, I need a shoulder
Cause the devil on one, the other one I'm lookin' over
Tunechi...
I just wanna be the one, I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down
I just wanna, I just wanna fly, I'ma show you tonight
That I'mma put it on you baby, take you past the sky
I just wanna burn
I pray I live forever
Niggas hatin' like it's Salt Lake City
No tints on that pretty ass Bentley
Want you to know that them comments don't offend me
Cause your baby momma so friendly
I proceed with the plan, weed in my hand
Ciroc in my cup, quick pic for a fan
Money over bitches, first nigga with a Wraith
Double M, we handle business cause them niggas getting raped
Go get the yellow tape, it's well orchestrated
200 acres estates, a young nigga made it
Came from the hood, ain't nothing changed
Still lemon pepper on my mothafuckin' wangs!
I just wanna be the one, I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down
I just wanna, I just wanna fly, I'ma show you tonight
That I'mma put it on you baby, take you past the sky
I just wanna burn
Huh! Mastermind
As I get high in the middle of the night
Sometimes I ask myself, do thugs cry?
Uhh, uhh, Mastermind, my 6th LP
Can't believe we did it
Man, I thank everybody that played a part of this
Shout out to my engineer E-Mix
Each and every one of you supporters
My fans, 100J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League
Huh! This is special
Extremely special
When 16 ain't enough
When 16 ain't enough
Ooh, yeah
Aw yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah
When 16 ain't enough
When 16 ain't enough
Ooh, yeah
Aw yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah
It's funny because, it's been on my mind lately
Having a dope beat, a dope idea
Sixteen bars ain't enough!
How the fuck, can I squeeze my whole life into a 16-bar verse?
You know, so many different levels, to living your life and
Depicting, with your wordplay
Exactly what life means to you, and sixteen ain't enough
I know y'all gonna feel me on this one
You gotta feel me on this one, huh!
It's funny how things change, funny how time fly
More than my feet travel, the more that I feel fly
More that I make now, the more that the chicks smile
She call me a local nigga, I opened a Swiss account
Eisenhower status, Etta James on the dash
Smooth as John Coltrane cruising in the Cadillac
Seville, feel my life on the real
We the Last Poets so this is a world premiere
Rolling like Mick Jagger, the women just getting badder
All I see is the money, cream, Eric Clapton
And all I wanted was one, 16 ain't enough
Talking that fast money, 15 every month
When your people labelled poor, that motivated me more
Everything I ever wore was once worn before
Roll with the punches now it's box office numbers
Dressed like Sammy Davis, steaming my marijuana
Double M G's, double M fees
We in every hood, nigga: government cheese
Yacht to Yachtmasters, Ol' Dirty Bastard
Floor seat for the Heat, paper that I'm stackin
Better put away a penny for the rainy days
Pick and roll, give and go, fuck a fade away
Living like Scottie Pippen, dribble riddles for vittles
Started off with a scribble, now I'm flowing a river
She say my heart cold, I'm naming my son December
Whitney died night before the Grammys – damn, what a memory
Trump Tower and I started with a 10 speed
Born broke, had to use a nigga's instincts
Now I get a hundred racks for the 16
Waking up to turkey bacon and my thick queen
Niggas hating, I'm just watching on the big screen
Three Stacks on the beat and the kicks mean
When 16 ain't enough
When 16 ain't enough
Ooh, yeah
Aw yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah
When 16 ain't enough
When 16 ain't enough
Ooh, yeah
Aw yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah
You know how sometimes you got so much to say but
They on-, they only give you 16? Hehehe
Man it's like, I mean, I got so much to say
The world has said so much to me
And I just wanna give right back to 'em
But, I only get 16, that's like a cage, you know?
I really can't say what I wanna say, you know?
It's just a glimpse, that's all
Just one uh, one little single glimpse, just a page
But I guess I'm defeating the purpose of doing all this talking
Aight
Summer '88, or was it '89?
Or was it wintertime? Aw never mind
I'm in my room, booming
Drawin' LL Cool J album covers with Crayolas on construction paper
I'm tryna fuck my neighbor, I'm tryna hook my waves up
I'm tryna pull my grades up, to get them saddle lace ups
Before lil' Marc was Jacob, before them girls wore makeup
Before my voice would break up, before we'd tour them shake clubs
Before my mama wake up, before my crumbs would cake up
Before they tell me they love me and we'll never break up
Before the time she makes love to someone that I thought was my homeboy
But boy, was I wrong now
I don't budge, don't want much, just a roof and a porch
And a Porsche, and a horse and unfortunately but of course
An assortment of torches that scorches the skin
When they enter, intruders whose tutors did
A lousy job, how's he God if he lets Lucifer let loose on us?
That noose on us won't loosen up but loose enough to juice us up
Make us think we do so much and do it big
Like they don't let us win, I can't pretend
But I do admit, it feel good when the hood pseudo-celebrate
Hence, why every time we dine we eat until our belly aches
Then go grab the finest wine and drink it
Like we know which grape and which region it came from
As if we can name 'em; hint-hint—it ain't, um, Welch's
Hell just fell three thousand more degrees cooler
Y'all can't measure my worth
But when you try, you'll need a ruler made by all the Greek gods
Because the odds have always been stacked against me when back's against the wall
I feel right at home, y'all sitting right at home
All Kellygreen with envy while I'm jelly beans descending
Into the palm of a child, looks up at mama and smile
With such a devilish grin, like "Where the hell have you been?"
She's yelling, "Selling’s a sin," well, so is telling young men
That selling is a sin if you don’t offer new ways to win
A dolphin gon' shake his fin, regardless if he gets in
Or out of water, most important thing for him is to swim
And Flipper didn’t hold his nose, so why shall I hold my tongue?
I miss the days of old when one could hold his gal on his arm
And not set off these alarms, when camera’s snap-snap-snap
Return fire, pap-pap-pap pap pap-pap pap pap
They’ll learn why, mere privacy, so essential
They won't make no laws, I break their laws 'til they see out our window
I take the fall to make them all treat human kind more gentle
Forsake them all, I hate them all, don’t like em, don’t pretend to
Yeah something tells me, we ain’t in Kansas anymore
All that shit that used to be cool ain’t cool anymore
All the women we were pursuing, now they want more
And they deserve it all, don’t settle for what ain’t yours
When 16 ain't enough
When 16 ain't enough
Ooh  yeah 
Aw yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah
When 16 ain't enough
When 16 ain't enough
Ooh, yeah 
Aw yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah 
Breakdown, breakdown
Does your mama know you see me? Does she know you're freaky?
Does she ever wonder if it's 'bout ya I am speaking?
Do you ever ponder where I'm at when you get sleepy?
How the hell I'm gonna tell the youth don't be me? Yeah
Hahahahah, hahahah, I love it
Does your daddy think you perfect? Does he know for certain?
Does he know how you act when you pull back all them curtains?
Do he think I'm 2Pac 'cause I'm Black and put the words in?
Does he know his daughter might have caught a real merman? Yeah
Hahahah, it's funny because, because you're a changer 
But because we love you, we go that extra mile
Break it down for 'em, André, huh!
Next level, amazingYo this Chris Rock! I'm in here with my man Ricky Rozay. We in here drinkin' this Belaire Rosé. That's how we do it. That's all we do, Belaire Rosé! Eatin' Wingstop, what you know about Wingstop, nigga? You don't know nothin' about no Wingstop. You can't handle this, nigga, you can't handle, sit down in the corner, shut the fuck up and take notes, bitch. Just take notes
I used to see niggas on TV, man
I used to be like, "Yo, them niggas so blessed"
You know what I'm sayin'?
If I had that opportunity, you know what I'm sayin'?
Damn, I grew up on that Cash Money
Bling bling, was well known to flash money
Hit the liquor store, after my Vic authority
Quick to switch a bitch up, pick up me a thicker shorty
Pistol on me, nigga, ain't no pickin' on me
We veterans so it's better if you go get your army
A thug holiday is where your body lay
Me and Trick Daddy come from a common place
So us gettin' money, that's just a conversation
It's so hard stayin' rich and miss the confrontations
Cigars in the Oval Office, Ronald Reagan
Hug Barack Obama, whisper, "As-salāmu ʿalaykum"
Live for the moment, die for the streets
Bible on the dash, kilos on the seat
I used to see you niggas on my TV screen
And wondered what was life like, was it all a dream?
And then I met you out on LiveNation dates
Came to the realization that your watch was fake
Damn... you nearly broke my heart
I really thought you niggas really owned them cars
I used to look up to you, nigga
Ugh
Hard to point a finger when you live a life of sin
I'ma bring my niggas with me if I lose or win
Bought a fleet of cars, let the bitches tag along
This little thing of ours, not the ones to tattle on
Omerta the code, Met Ball, parties with Vogue
Still blowin' thick smoke while you powder your nose
Such a head rush until the day the feds rush
That's when you niggas wish you put your bread up
Leased whips, bad blood, that shit'll sink ships
Fast money comin' slow, you better think quick
Rap game, so much fuck shit done
That's why this .45 in my Trukfit trunks
Fuck a skateboard, I went and got a Wraith, boy
Catholic record labels, niggas gettin' raped, boy
Birdman's a priest, moans in his synagogue
Publishin' is a sin, repent, forgive me, Lord
Shots fired, home invasion out on Palm Isle
Red beam detonators, who the bomb now?
Look you in your eyes, nigga, 'fore I say good night
And pray that Mannie Fresh'll get to see the light
Damn, Stunna
I loved you, nigga
Hate it came to this
You stole them boys' pub' and bought a foreclosure
Scott Storch demons in it, which is more poison
I handed over records, never charged a coin
But could sense the sentiment, I'm talkin' all along
All Miami issues, Rozay handle for him
Same way Big Ducky do for me in California
Never slippin', got relationships with the trillest niggas
Tony Draper, J Prince and even Jimmy Henchmen
Plenty killers and I know that Diddy with it
Tyga, chinchilla, really ain't no penny pinchin'
Knew that you would never visit BG
Turk came home, take that boy a three piece
Shootin' dope, usin' coke, movin' like you the Folks
Sacrificin' half our life for your new music cult
You would give us self esteem and motivate our drive
But was in our pockets by the time we count to five
I pray you find the kindness in your heart for Wayne
His entire life, he gave you what there was to gain
I watched this whole debacle so I'm part to blame
Last request, can all producers please get paid?
Can't believe this shit, homie
I still love you, nigga
How the fuck, nigga, you touch half a billion, nigga
And your team starvin', nigga?
You on an island, nigga, you came to my city, nigga
I let you in my city, nigga
And what hurt me the most, nigga
Is how you did my brother Khaled, nigga
Khaled was loyal to you, nigga
The pain I seen in my brother's eye, nigga
FaceTimin' my nigga, nigga, he took that to the chin, nigga
That's why my nigga blessed!
That's why my nigga Khaled blessed!
You put my nigga in the hole, homie
I don't feel you for that, my nigga
That shit hurt me, you under-dig? Umm
It's painful what you see real niggas do
When they get the paper, when they get the bag
You can't never forget 'bout lil bruh and them
I'll never forget 'bout lil bruh and them
Lil bruh and them, always remember
Lil bruh and them, this for lil bruh and them
StunnaGeah

Ugh
Let the top down
I came a long way from the weed game
Twenty stack seats at the Heat game 
And I'm still strapped with the heat man 
Can't be steppin' on a nigga feet man 
80 pair of sneakers came from the D game
Cousin was a Crip, said it was a C thing
Brown bag money in a duffle bag
Fuck 'em all, wet 'em, then we gotta double back
The homie whippin' chickens in his momma kitchen
On the mission, said he get it for his son tuition 
Real nigga's dreams comin' to fruition
Stumble, but I never fall, leanin' on my pistol 
I only love it when her ass fat
We should listen to this track in my Maybach 
I'm just tryin' to be a billionaire
Come and suck a dick for a millionaire 
Ugh
It's just different
I know it feels different
Ugh
I only love her if her eyes brown
Play this shit while you play around with my crown
King H-O, y'all should know by now
But if you don't know, ugh
Millions on the wall in all my rooms
Niggas couldn't fuck with my daughter's room
Niggas couldn't walk in my daughter's socks
Banksy, bitches, Basquiat
I ran through that buck fifty Live Nation fronted me
They workin' on another deal, they talkin' two-hundred-fifty!
I'm holdin' out for three
Two-seventy-five and I just might agree
Ex-D-boy, used to park my Beamer
Now look at me, I can park in my own arena
I only love her if her weave new
I'm still a hood nigga, what you want me to do?
Been hoppin' out the BM with your BM
Taking her places that you can't go with your per diem
Screamin' "Carpe diem!" until I'm a dead poet
Robin Williams shit, I deserve a Golden Globe, bitch!
I'll take a Ace in the meanwhile
You ain't gotta keep this, Khaled, it's just a freestyle
Fuck rap money, I've made more off grapes
Fuck show money, I spent that on drapes
Close the curtains, fuckboy, out my face
I whip the coke, let the lawyer beat the case
Murder was the case that they gave me
I killed the Hermès store, somebody save me
Stuntin' to the max like, wavy!
Oh, shit!
Oh, stuntin' to the max, I'm so wavy
Used to shop at TJ Maxx back in '83
I don't even know if it was open then
I ain't know Oprah then
Had the XL 80 bike, loud motor, they be like, "Damn!"
When I'm comin' through, rrraaanngg
Had the grill in '88, y'all niggas is late
You got all that, right?
Ugh! I love this shit like my own daughter
Spray these niggas, baby, just like daddy taught ya
Young
It's just differentWhat is this? 
Maybach Music
I like this Maybach Music, hahahaha
She's just perfect in every kinda way
But I don't think I can handle her pain
So messed up and I'm too busy just runnin' my game
Oh, girl after girl, mistake after mistake
I've tried to change, but they always around pullin' me down in bed 
Gave you my word, but they were just broken promises 
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex 
I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit
Sorry, won't turn back the clock
Baby, I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry don't make it right, I know
We at the crib, she got her legs wrapped around my waist
Conversation, she lick every tattoo that's on my face
Like a thug, I just wanna fuck, that's every day
Temporary separations, confessin' my mistakes
She packed her bags and left me home and I'm still hurt
You new pussy, but she can't tell me that it's real first
A lot of lies apologized, the thirst real
When she hear this thinkin' to herself, "Damn this verse real"
Rehab out in Vegas, that made this a murdered sin
Sent the bottles to her table, then made love on the jet
Temporary thrills, all these women you think I tossed
My feelings genuine, disregard what you see on blogs
I been a boss before I recorded Meek song
Mill in cash on the 'gram, they trendin' Meech home
In the D and my G, he throwin' that P-Stone
Every picture that you post, we comments on each one
I'm just a typical ordinary nigga
But I know that I can't change the rules
All this time I blamed you 'cause I know what I'm doing
Stepping on your heart again, relationship ruined
I tried to change, but I'm always out, fuckin' around in the club 
Pieces of my love letter tore up from this break up 
My worst nightmare went right in my back, I wish I could wake up 
I feel like shit, know I ain't shit, but I'm... 
Sorry, won't turn back the clock
Baby, I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry don't make it right, I know  
Life's short and baby girl, you deserve a winner
Every day the diamonds on you get bigger and bigger
Hustle from my heart, so every night I can deliver 
Sayin', "Sorry", layin' up, I'm way up in your liver 
The red bottoms got you walkin' funny 
Get you an agent, she ballin' and all she talk is money 
Take her shoppin', baby boy, ain't no salary caps 
She get it poppin', so you better bring battery packs 
Perfect time to relax
Nothing is perfect other than me and the perfect match
They all watch me 'cause the moves I make out they budgets
Diamond district, six figures on my shorty nugget
I've tried to change, but they always around, pullin' me down in bed 
Gave you my word, but they were just broken promises
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex
Yeah, I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit
Sorry, won't turn back the clock 
Baby, I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry don't make it right This shit is highly sophisticated
I just make it look easy, nigga
Follow me
I'm so sophisticated
To get a verse from me, you gotta be initiated
To get a purse from me, she gotta be sophisticated
Purchase a whip from me and never miss a single payment
I'm from the city where the Muslims even Christians hate it
Even the black folk hate to see another nigga made it
Tell all them pussies to chill, champagne refrigerated
Just bought a chopper 'cause the last one, got it confiscated
Counting a hundred mil so many times, I contemplate it
You wanna be the hottest but that shit get complicated
I pull your card, I know you're pussy by your conversation
Show you the safe, you'll have to kill me for that combination
Made another two milli just off the compilation
I just hit a lick, I'm telling you this shit amazing
Got a white bitch, she fucking me just like she Jamaican
Sipping purple and that motherfucker concentrated
This for my niggas in them prisons, overpopulated
This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mark, then you gotta make initial payment
We going hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton
The game sweet, gave all my niggas an occupation 
We so sophisticated 
Shit so sophisticated 
Hundred millionaires, bitch we made it 
I'm so sophisticated
Smoking weed, busting open Dom and liquor later
I bust her open then I tell her I'ma lick her later
Pull out the stick and spray that bitch just like it’s activator
Time to lay down these niggas who still be masquerading
We know you pussies, so you got my niggas masturbating
Round of applause 'cause them choppers be so captivating
So sophisticated ‘cause them hits be calculated
Put yo dick in the dirt, now you decapitated
I'm getting money so you'll never hear me talking petty
Tatted on my stomach, rich forever, Makaveli 
Fifty million, hundred million, it's accumulating
I'm the hottest and these other niggas cooling, ain't it
I got a bitch I'm fucking that you see on BET
My Lil' Haiti shooters will have yo ass on TMZ
Breaking news and we still get them for ten a key
And if he faking, fuck him, tell them niggas "C'est la vie"
This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mark, then you gotta make initial payment
We going hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton
The game sweet, gave all my niggas an occupation 
We so sophisticated 
Shit so sophisticated 
Hundred millionaires, bitch we made it 
Shitting on these haters, ball hard D Waiters
Ever since I got money, e'rybody need favors
That's why I ain't got no homies, and I ain't got no neighbors
But I be on my grind like I ain't got no paper
But I'm so rich and I got yo bitch
All in my whip and she all on my dick
With a hand on my stick, tryna live in my crib
'Cause I handle my shit like a candle got lit
'Cause I burn shit down, yeah I'm in my bag
And these niggas so mad it's my turn now
And I get that cash and my bitch so bad, she so sophisticated
I'm balling hard, fucking bitches and ain't got shit for haters
I hang my arm out the window now watch me get the paper
My neck so frosty, you frauding, yo shit refrigerator
Boy you an imitator
You ain’t got no M's in yo account, I never ask my amount
Treat that bad bitch like a bad check 'cause I cash that and I bounce
I ain't never had shit but I grab shit and I cashed out on that ounce
And I flipped that to a bird and bounced back like word
This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mark, then you gotta make initial payment
We going hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton
The game sweet, gave all my niggas an occupation 
We so sophisticated 
Shit so sophisticated

The real Noriega, he owe me a hundred favors

Ain't 'bout no funny shit, still bitches and business

Major league, who catchin' because I'm pitchin'
Jose Canseco just snitchin' because he's finished
I feed 'em steroids to strengthen up all my chickens
They flyin' over Pacific to be specific
Triple C's, you know it's fact, we holdin' sacks

Talk about me cause these suckas scared to talk about me
Killers talkin' 'bout me, it ain't no talk about me
It ain't no walkin' round me, see all these killers round me
Lotta drug dealin' 'round me goin' down in Dade County
Don't tote no twenty-twos, Magnum cost me twenty-two
Sat it on them 22's, birds go for 22
Lil' mama super thick, she say she 22
She seen them 22's, we in room 222
I touch work like I'm Convertible Burt
I got distribution so I'm convertin' the work

Every day I'm, every day I'mYou wanted to fuckin' walk around these roaches. These niggas is roaches. These niggas is mere motherfuckin' mortals. I'm tryna push you to supreme bein'. You don't wanna motherfuckin'... You don't wanna embrace your destiny, you wanna get by
You don't wanna go into the motherfuckin' dark where it's lonely. You can't handle the motherfuckin', the pain of the motherfuckin' not knowin' when the shit is gonna stop
Momma's tryna save me but she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
"Blast for me" – the last words from my nigga
On the pavement, born killers, body shivers
Drug money, dollar figures
Hustlers movin' out of rentals, art of war is mental
Havin' sushi down in Nobu
Strapped like an Afghan soldier, nowhere to go to
So it's bang, no survivors
Only riders on my rider, murder rate rises
Stalkin' niggas on their IG's, never; I be
Still solo, Under Armour still Polo
No wire, on fire
My desire for fine things made me a liar, a shooter
Gettin' high feelin' like it's vodou
Nine lives, SK with the cooler
Makaveli in the 'Rari, still B-I double G, I, E
I pray you smoke with me
Go to bed with a kilo like Casino
Janet Reno, we all we got the creed of Nino
Pretty cars in the driveway
If you cut it then you sideways, double up, crime pays
Momma's tryna save me but she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
You fuckin' wanna walk around with these niggas? What the fuck is their culture? Where the fuck is their souls at? What defines you? These niggas with these fuckin' silly looks on their faces. You wanna walk around with them or you wanna walk with God, nigga? Make up your goddamn mind
I'm from where the streets test you
Niggas mix business and pleasure where the cocaine measure
The narcotics is our product
The by-product, you walk up on me, I cock it
New Mercedes as it peels off
Nothin' penetrates the steel doors, gang signs, see 'em all
I said my prayer as I'm countin' sheep
Never really athletic, but I play for keeps, do you feel me?
The mortician, the morgue fillin' with more snitches
We kill 'em and takin' their bitches, R.I.P
Chinchillas on a winter night
Black bottles when I'm feelin' like, you wanna know what winners like
And I'm never on that tour bus
Just a decoy for niggas, the PJ's for two of us
Ciroc boys down to die for Diddy
My niggas ride for less, keep it real, homie, made me filthy
Touch mine, until it's even: kill
Like I'm knowin' every heathen will, closed the deal with Steven Hill
We Magic City of the networks
Cut a nigga cast off, how my nigga net worths
Momma's tryna save me but she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
Fuck, y'all wanna talk about fuckin' jewelries and Bentley's and Hublot's and fuckin' art that niggas ain't got on their fuckin' walls and fuckin' mansions niggas ain't got. Niggas can't even pay the IRS, let alone their fuckin' staff, nigga. You gotta tell the truth, man. The truth'll set you free, son, the truth will set you freeUgh
Ugh

My Rolls Royce triple-black, I'm Geechie, ho
Ballin' in the club, bottles like I'm Meechie, ho
Rozay—that's my nickname
Cocaine runnin' in my big veins
Self-made, you just affiliated
I build it ground-up, you bought it renovated
Talkin' plenty capers, nothing's been authenticated
Funny, you claimin' the same bitch that I'm penetrating
Hold the bottles up, where my comrades?
Where the fuckin' felons? Where my dogs at?
 I got that Archie Bunker
And it's so white, I just might charge you double

Look at yourself, now look at me 
You can't see a nigga, I'm what you used to be 
Look at it this way , you niggas sideways 
Always gettin' money, my nigga, crime pays 
So fuck a nigga , I'm self-made 
You a sucker nigga , I'm self-paid 
This for my broke niggas , this for my rich niggas 
Got a hundred on a head of a snitch nigga 
I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Whippin' work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start

Gettin' work, hallelujah 
One nation, under God 
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start 
The thirty-six holes leave you bleedin', family 
Word to them thirty-six Os in a kilogram 
Blunt tip orange like caviar
Wildin' out, fishtailin', Subaru, rally car 
Out the passenger, lettin' the automatty off 
A eighth of that girl I'll knock your mommy and your daddy off 
Fuck around and knock the emblem on the Caddy off 
Four shooters buggin' out, blickin' at your Caddy doors 
And did I mention guns from Red Dead Redemption? 
Nine-mils, fifty-clip extensions 
Coke is like a mattress in the hood, I'm flippin' on it 
And the money's like a chair, I'm sittin' on it 
I think I'm Big Meech , Larry Hoover
Whippin' work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start
I think I'm Big Meech , Larry Hoover 
Gettin' work, hallelujah

I look in my fridge, my shit lookin' scarce
I got a few kids, we need some shit on the shelf
I get a knock at the door, they say my rent overdue
And while my niggas sell dope and don't know what else to do
The only thing on my mind, I'm tryin' to keep on the lights
I call up my slime, I need a kilo tonight
Everything went well, I'm eatin' steak, no more soup
Then I parked the Caprice, I went and got me a coupe
Everything takes time, but this shit came fast
Niggas standin' in line, they wanna hold me back
I multiplied my hustle, stimulated my mind
Motivated my niggas and we'll never divide, NO!
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back

First I got me a Taurus, then I copped me a Lexus
I took over Florida, my connect out of Texas
Then I start sippin' purple, got my shit screwed
When you feedin' your circle, watch your shipments improve
Fabricate 'bout your fortune, all my fabric's imported
Fornicate in my fortress, 40k still my mortgage
24k my toilet, all my taxes reported
All my exes deported, shout-out Texas, New Orleans
All these niggas influenced by a hustler's endurance
I just bought me the purest, but I need some insurance
Niggas watch who you fuckin' just to hate on your bitches
Niggas breakin' the rules, niggas facin' suspension
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back

Momma workin' three jobs 'til I told her to quit
How we rose from the sewers, funny now I'm the shit
Niggas ain't gettin' money, but they got an opinion
Had this tech makin' racket, serve you like you were tennis
Killers ride for that paycheck, AK, okay, check
Bitch nigga let's play chess, yo bitch next, no latex
These niggas won't hold me back, told the feds they sold me sack
Whip 'em right and then come right back
Whip-whip-whip 'em right and then come right back

These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back...Just being somebody that the neighborhood respected
And my mama could be proud of, was the apple of my eye
That's all I ever wanted, just being something, man
So at that point what else can you ask for?
Tears runnin' down a nigga face
In a room full of failures, I feel out of place
Still sleepin' on the floor when you deserve better
Got you reekin' through the cold even in warm weather
I told Meek, "I wouldn't trust Nicki
Instead of beefin' with your dog, you just give 'em some distance"
We all make mistakes, let's not be too specific
We like, "I rather be a killer than be a statistic"
I never fold, no, I never ran
On my soul, I'll roll like an avalanche
I thank the Lord I got some great friends
That's why every bottle I open, I say, "Amen"
Just had seizure at the Super Bowl
Woke up in the third quarter lookin' for the smoke
If it's more than a quarter million, I'll count it twice
Pucci broke my heart, shit, I call it life
And never will I call it right
Not perfect but I'm the one you would call at night
Travelin' the world, I'm just reppin' my city
But rarely do I hear that this nigga done did it
When niggas in fatigues will keep you intrigued
'Cause the loss of life's the only thing niggas believe
So I pray you listen carefully
Then I become another motherfuckin' casualty
Always speak and say hi
You just never ever walk on by 
You even stopped and put one in the sky 
You do it for the love of you and I 
Standin' on your block but you so out of place
Uncle on the couch, momma runnin' out of space
Lights off so you never tend to speak much
Go your separate ways every time the lease up
A fat ugly nigga, thought I'd never be nothin'
Another tree stump, happy with his free lunch
Duckin' pigeons, I'm an eagle on a sunny day
Flap my wings once a week, pray I glide safe
I want fried chicken at my funeral
Rolls Royces, dope boys, Sway interviews
Everybody dyin' for the same things
Cop kill a nigga, don't nobody gangbang
I'm happy Donald Trump became the president
Because we gotta destroy, before we elevate
Real shit, look at me inside the white house
With a pocket full of weed inside the white house
Dead presidents tattooed on a nigga chest
U.S. treasury addressing me, mad at my address
Own the biggest residential pool in the U.S
Drake and Kanye can invite every bitch they ever met
Finger fuckin' bitches in the holy water
Then I go an tell what happened to my only daughter
So her daddy told it to her firsthand
Never perfect but it's not just 'bout them purses
Always speak and say hi
You just never ever walk on by 
You even stopped and put one in the sky 
You do it for the love of you and I 
Maybach Music
The streets could never teach me
All the things I got from you
I found myself in the wrong lane
And I ended up in pain, pain
I was strolling down a dark street
When this girl passed me by
She said you've always been a good friend 
And you never never never let me down
I'll just fall back, never turn back
Let it go, let it go
I'll just fall back, never turn back
Let it go, let it go
Always speak and say hi
You just never ever walk on by 
You even stopped and put one in the sky 
You do it for the love of you and I This is for the soldiers that see the sun at midnight, ya dig?
Let me slow down 
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
We the lost symbols speak in cryptic code
Ancient wisdom valuable like gifts of Gold
I embark on life, my path is all math
I understand the codes these hackers can’t crack
I understand that folks expect me to fold
Community control to violate parole
I won't fail, but a lot of men will
I’m iconic in the field like Solomon's Seal
Uh, it’s just the intro
Allow my flow time to sink into the tempo
Free Mason, freelancer
Free agents , we faster 
Big contracts, big contractors
Built pyramids, period, we masters
No caterpillars, it was just a lot of niggas
A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors
All white mansion, I’m the child of God
All black diamonds, times were hard
New Rolls Royce, guess you made it, nigga
All-white neighborhood, you they favorite nigga
My top back like JFK
They wanna push my top back like JFK
So, so I "JFK"
Join forces with the kings and we ate all day
Right now I could rewrite history
I stopped writing, so fuck it I’ll do it mentally
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
Niggas couldn’t do nothing with me, they put the devil on me
I would have preferred niggas to squeeze the metal on me
Rumors of Lucifer, I don’t know who to trust
Whole world want my demise; turn the music up
Hear me clearly
If y’all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me
Fuck all these fairy tales; go to Hell, this is God engineering
This is a Hail Mary pass, y’all interfering
He without sin shall cast the first stone
So y'all look in the mirror, double-check your appearance
Bitch, I said I was amazing
Not that I'm a Mason
It’s amazing, that I made it through the maze that I was in
Lord forgive me, I never would've made it without sin
Holy water, my face in the basin
Diamonds in my Rosary shows, he forgave him
Bitch I'm red-hot, I'm on my 3rd 6
But a devil I'm not, my Jesus-piece flooded
But thou shall not covet, keep your eyes off my cupboard
I'm a bad motherfucker, it's Hov, just say you love it
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
If I ever die, never let it be said I didn’t win
Never, never say, never say Legend didn’t go in 
I just wanna die on top of the world
And makin love to my favorite girl
I'm making beautiful music, we making a movie
We knew we was born to do it
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplying and I pray to God we never die

Unless it had to do with mine, in the middle of the night
Killers coming for you life, all you wanna do is shine?

I see your praying to Jesus, but will that help ease the pain?
Seen a brother get slain for a jar full of change

Pigs' feet in a jar; serve it to me warm
Any questions, they hang 'em, better pray for Dj-Django
Got me working in fields, too many years it gets fatal
All I want is my woman, such a wonderful mother, 
On the days that it rains, her smile bright like a summer
Our revenge is the sweetest, bitch cause I'm coming
Gonna die in my arms, for what you did to my mother 
Hundred dead bitches,  hundred black coffins

That we gon' be rich forever
And ever, and ever, oh-oh, oh-oh
We gon' be rich forever, oh oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
We gon' be rich forever, and ever, and ever
I remember bein' blind to it
'Til the day I put my mind to it
Pen and pad on the dresser for me to fine tune it
I sat in the corner, made up my mind, do it
Def Jam on my heels, should I sign to it?
Million dollar advance for me to rhyme fluent
Every day I'm hustlin' on every corner boomin'
Back of the Phantom, couldn't fathom, I was such a student
Grandfather deal for the Godfather
Lucian Grainge from the ghetto, I follow God's orders
And he told me I was rich forever
And he showed me I was rich forever
They call me Mr. Roberts when I'm in the bank
Digits like the Dodgers when it come to franks
Flossin' out in Compton like I got a cape
RoseMo tried to fight it, but barely niggas fade
White sheet, yellow tape, where your dogs at
Count a million cash, can you blog that?
Me and niggas your type never exchange numbers
Want to conversate and steal game from us

Still smoking sticky, it ain't no other option
Not for made niggas and I’m never stopping
I raised the bar, I set the standards
My yayo Usher Raymond, that bitch just keep on dancing
Dollar bills on top of dollar bills
Thats all I’m throwing, if she won't lil' momma will
Made niggas, talking a lotta skrill
Eight digits a nigga tryna live
Made man, you hear what I said
I got a hundred squares if you scared, called the feds
Made men, I’m screaming dollar bills
Pop the trunk on the Porsche, there they go, dollar bills
Riding round the city, plastic cup of Henny
Find a nigga like me, truth be told, I don’t know many
I say shout my driver Lauren, that 62 with curtains
Can't see shit, I don’t know where the fuck I’m at for certain
When it boils down, I’m just a T.O. nigga
But bitches tell me that I look just like a creole nigga
New Orleans know it’s love, everytime I’m in town
Shout out my nigga Tez, that's my brother my round

Off the rack just ain't my style, I call it designer
One of my baddest women ever, I call her Rihanna
... But that's cause her name is Rihanna!
I’m in the condo just posting watching Miami kill
I might just walk to the arena and watch it for real
Ashes to ashes, me, Rozay and Khaled
Smoking bull riders, shit moving slow as a ballad
Tattoo on your ass, it’d be nice if you show me
I’m buying bitches furs, Mike Tyson, Naomi
I’ve got the right to do it, it’s only right to do it
Love me some head, and I love a woman that likes to do it

The side you gotta watch your A&E cable television for homie
But we live this shit
I'm not a star, well that's a lie
I seen a man raise his hand on the stand, he testified
Spoke on the homicides, amongst other things
Even shared my triple beam dreams
A project minded individual, criminal tactics
Us black kids born with birth defects, we hyperactive
Mentally sex-crazed, dysfunctional, they describe us
They liars, at the end of the day, we're fuckin' survivors
I remember watchin' Scarface the first time
Look at that big house, that Porsche paid for by crime
How could I sell this poison to my peoples, in my mind?
They dumb and destroy themselves is how I rationalize
In the bastardized nation, Magnum .45 carryin'
Where I'm from ain't far from Washington Heights to cop Aryan
A rookie boy, the cookie didn't make no profit
A stranger to the block, I damn near had to make them cop it
It only took a fiend to taste it once to say it's garbage
I brought it back to papi, ain't tryna take no losses
He focuses on my emotionless young dealer face, then pauses
He gives me powder, he has faith in Nas' ambitions to distribute coke
Had addictions to gold chains, Mercedes Benz hopes, but I'm again broke
This shit ain't cut for me, other dealers, they up their orders
Barely at 62s, they already up to quarters
They out there every day, some true hustlers for you
I'm at it half way, none of my customers are loyal
Picturin' pipin' out the seats of a Pathfinder
Powerful pursuit for pussy, cash, to flash diamonds
My junior high school class, wish I stayed there
Illegal entrepreneur, I got my grades there
Blamin' society, mad, it wasn't made fair
I would be Ivy League if America played fair
Poor excuse, and so I was
Throwin' rocks at the pen, just for the love
Before the evil, the secret life of G's
You seein' me blurry, triple beam dreams
Pocket full of money, parkin' lot full of them haters
Triple beam dreamin', crib with 2 elevators
20 flat screens and got cameras every angle
Dope been comin' so you know the income major
Rule number 1: I can't do business with a stranger
Contract killers comin' when I feel endangered
Early 90s reminiscin' when I had a pager
Triple beam dreams: now Pat Riley my neighbor
Fuck boy, talkin' out of turn nigga
In the court room, spreadin' like a germ nigga
25 on the line, them niggas droppin' dimes
Cooperation got them rednecks droppin' time
Khaki suits and some niggas go to actin' cute
We was all cool, stackin' in Acura coupes
More accurately, we acted as is if jackin' was cool
Snatchin' niggas out they shoes then wear jackets to school
Fuck boy, you caught up in my dream
Countin' cream on the cover of a magazine
I'm the source, got the plug with the uncut
Jay-Z Blue Magic nigga, what what
Brand new S Class with a meal ticket
Nigga cocaine white as Tommy Hilfiger
Ralph Lauren Blue Label as I'm gettin' high
Triple dream dreamin' as the cream multiples
Fuck boy, talkin' out of turn nigga
'Fore you sell dope, it's shit you gotta learn nigga
Home invasions, duct tape
Fornicatin', countin' money with a fuck face
Fuckin' bitches that be givin' up your whereabouts
Slow leaks, gotta air em out
Kill 'em all, Rolls Royce Ghost nigga, ball
Phantom drop head, shit I had to get em all
Niggas hate but they know they never get involved
Food on the plate, fuck em all, I could send my dog
Triple beam dreams, the ghetto's my reality
I'm from where your hustle determines your salary
Six figure family member, nigga forget about it
Low income housin', nigga tryna get up out it
I got a plan little nigga, just believe in me
Triple beam dreamin' with this thing in me
Pocket full of money, parkin' lot full of them haters
Triple beam dreamin', crib with 2 elevators
20 flat screens and got cameras every angle
Dope been comin' so you know the income major
Rule number 1: I can't do business with a stranger
Contract killers comin' when I feel endangered
Early 90s reminiscin' when I had a pager
Triple beam dreams: now Pat Riley my neighborGo on jump

Yes you do. You smoke crack don't you? You smoke crack don't you?
Look at me boy, don't you smoke crack?

Hallucination of money, while nigga's stomach just rumble

Nigga livin' in rubble, but then I'm labelled a rebel
Any nigga wan' rumble, somebody hand me a shovel

Steppin' off the Sonoma with the black duffle bag filled
Got a cute bitch with me, favor Kimora, for real
Got Meek Mill on the celly  that nigga worth a few mil

We pirates out here, nigga, just trying to stay afloat
And I ride for my niggas
Fascination with fortune afford me mansion and Porsches
Panameras abortion, marijuana imported
Dreams of gettin' cream and never to be extorted
Seen so many things, be preposterous not to record it
Product is in demand, profit not far behind
Got on my mother pearl, she fuckin' up father time
Babies be havin' babies, I'm talkin' 'bout how I grind
Niggas thinkin' it's voodoo the way bricks be multiplyin'
Affiliated with wealth, associated with death
Self-made millionaire, snatch a triple beam off the shelf

Blackberry boss, one call, ya put to sleep

So now when I menage and get massaged it's the proof
Proof's in the pudding and that baking soda cakin'
Paper that I'm makin' got her takin' photos naked
Listenin' to niggas like whistlin' at Wendy Williams

But I thought about my future and the loops I could pin

All my CDs gold but the Visa darker
Bastard child but I got a fleet of cars

Coke boy, I'll be thirty for sure now
Coke damn near same price as dope nowGod forgives, He's so honorable
But livin' amongst thieves and niggas like myself
You will not have that luxury
I wake up excited, I made it through the night
Things I did in the dark, will it ever see the light?
My nerves should be a wreck, I got a bad chick
She keeps me erect, she loves my ad-libs
I think I'm a genius, hundred grand a fuckin' feature
I do at least three a week, roll up the fuckin' reefer
Went from Benihana to Bimini in Bahamas
Ten chains, no luggage, I'm a big timer
Niggas claim that they thuggin' when they dick-ridin'
My niggas rather walk, do they own brick climbin'
On the block in my all white sneakers
Lord knows in my ten Jesus pieces
Pray for me cause you know a nigga doin' wrong
My homie in the cell, so I had to write a poem
Count mills for the times that we had it hard
Askin' for a hundred mill as I pray to God
I do this for my niggas facin' hard times
Can't be on them corners if you hustlin' part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, comin' from the Pharcyde
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick to quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces
Young nigga comin' up, they wanna gun you down
Drinkin' vodka in the memory of my nigga, damn 
Ridin' real slow on them all golds 
Shoppin' for them Os when the mall close
Reppin' for your homies when they all gone
Get empowered then you put your dog on 
All black tees, ten gold chains
At the Super Bowl, but we in the dope game
Ten years strong in the same trap
Ten years blowin' on that strong pack
Lord knows that I wanna live right
But Lord knows what that Club Liv like 
Forty dollar tab meanin' forty grand
Lil Wodie got it rolled up in a rubber band
Holdin' on the forty in his other hand
Ten chains on, smokin' in the motherland
I do this for my niggas facin' hard times
Can't be on them corners if you hustlin' part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, comin' from the Pharcyde
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick to quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces
I'm his poltergeist, niggas know I'm more than nice
All these jewels on, all Moissanites
I could see it in the sparkle cause it lackluster
Black card maxed out, damn black brother
White collar, black market
Chrome Smith and Wesson, back pocket
Eight shot, bitch I'm a top shotta
Screamin' your affiliations, but that don't matter
I'm flyin' first class as the snakes slither
Never blackmail a motherfuckin' killer
On trial and they wanna execute me
It's really sad, just the fact they never knew me
True G to the core, feel my texture
A true G keeps it raw in his lecture
Keep it simple, white tee, new sneakers
Dope boy style, ten Jesus pieces
I do this for my niggas facin' hard times
Can't be on them corners if you hustlin' part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties

Nas did it fresh, Jay did it fresh, I mean
Ye did it fresh, but man Big did it the best
And I was so impressed that I went and got ten
Now I'm stuntin' on these niggas cause I couldn't back then
Rose gold, yellow gold, a couple platinum
And I wear them all at once, I ain't tryna match them
I remember bumpin' Mack 10 and that deuce in the corner
Scrapin' up for a sandwich and a soda
Now my strength is up and I'm danglin' chains off my shoulders
But no Jesus piece on mine, cause at times I feel ashamed
For the reason that I buy em
And they say, because I'm Muslim I shouldn't think about the shine
Or even put it in a rhyme
It's better things I could talk about or put my money towards
But for now, I'mma wear these ten chains and floss
I do this for my niggas facin' hard times
Can't be on them corners if you hustlin' part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, comin' from the Pharcyde
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick to quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces
We untouchable
Xolaal sama guys, dundu ben yoon la
Dangay dundu sa dundu, gemm Yalla
Ligeey, xalis, gnax, amoul nelaw, gnafè
Sa life yako dugal, ken du ko jappale
Yow ya ray sa bopp ba dee. Moy loolu
Mi historia es complicada, pero al final del dia valio la pena, porque ahora estoy trabajando con el jefe
Yo vivi en Colombia y vivi muchas cosas, me entiende?
Vi muertes...vi muertes...vi cuerpos en las calles, sangrando despues del colegio, con 12, 13 años viendo estas cosas en la calle
Y siempre queria venir para aqui otra vez, y me vine, y trabaje porque tenia otra mentalidad. Y cuando llegue aca entendi mi proposito: hacer dinero, ser rico para siempre

I just upped my stock, fuck them cops
If you love hip-hop bust them shots
Your man is priceless, if your man's loyal
Better give that man a raise or end up paying for it
If you cut it, call it Jam Master Jay
No Adidas but I rock a brick a day
Talk about the jewels outta nigga reach
Nigga please, so I came back with a bigger piece
You still smokin' weed on your car chase
I'm pullin' off the car lot screaming: "God’s great!"
Before the crib you gotta clear the guard's gate
Elevators like Frank's on Scarface
New Presidential had that pavé
Like a G, I gave the Cartier to Wale
Then I gave Meek Mill a Range Rover
Told Warner Brothers that the game's over
For me to move forward from here on I need 50
I ain't talking 50 Cent neither nigga, haha
I came back a rich nigga
Young mogul, Bo Jackson, I'm a switch hitter
They want me face down on the pavement
Gang members claimin' I need to make a payment
It's hard for a young black executive
Can't you see we're all fucking relatives
Relatively easy we can go to war
Fuck it, we can go to war
Chasing me a hundred million, that's inshallah
Fresh up out the Feds system, welcome home Jabar

That's why I had to play the part, nigga
That wasn't me, it was a job, nigga
It gets deeper, that was just a start, nigga
Screamin' in my sleep, I know Lord hear me

Me against the world, me and my baby girl
Me and my baby girl, me and my baby girl
Double R, me and you, taking over the world
Taking over the world, taking over the world
Going hard was a given; the chance I wasn't given
Til I pulled right beside her, she was sitting in the Civic
Man, you was just who I was looking for
Top down, you could never overlook a boy
Big buckets, magnum bottles of that rose
On my R. Kelly, girl I'm bout that foreplay
Slow it down, speed it up, I'm just being me
Panamera here's the keys, thats just the G in me
Got a crib on the water, need a bathing suit
Bond that we share so unbreakable

Me and my baby girl, me and my baby girl
You know I'm on the grind so I miss you at times
All on my mind as I'm scribbling lines
I put the weed out, cause it play with my head
Turning money down, we just laying in bed
She blowing money wild, bundles of bread
Times are priceless, it can go to your head
I think my mind blown, I barely feel my feet
I'mma hold my head high even in defeat
It's not a mind game so don't even think
Even if it was, it'd be over 'fore you blinked
You don't have to play mine games
Just tell me what's yours is mine

Nappy-headed nigga, pocket full of crack rock

Watching from my point you thought it was a fucking film
One day he buy the car, next day the fucking rims
Curly-headed bitches, tall and they slim
They know him as the myth but see I know it's him
Never testify, I seen it in his eye
Attempted murder on his life in that 360i
With my two eyes
Two different pistols

Got on my hoodie and my motherfucking Desert Eagle
You wanna do me, then you go and tell the people
Knock me down, temp drops as the sun rise
I could see a hustler in my son's eyes
I never knew that money bring so many enemies
Dreams come true, they dream of killing me
But it's fuck 'em and I feed 'em fish
Them killers coming, 'X' you off the list
Now I'm being followed by some creepy-ass cracker

I got more money than that pussy that you’re signed to
Survive, who call this a color money conversation
A hundred stacks will cover everything I’m contemplating
Full confrontation, home invasion for the quarter key
Them cheap ass condos ain't the safest place you want to be
Call him a C.O. but you better not go call police
So when I see you, I’mma give you what you wanna see
You wanna see?
Color money
Color money
Uh, pussy nigga
Rob a nigga close to me, you better bring it back
Until the day we even steven, tell you bring it back
Red rubies on they can't believe a nigga rap
Color money still feed niggas in the trap
They got the Rolie with the red face
The red ring nigga looking like a fed case
Fuck all these rappers, real talk, 'cause I ain't fucking with 'em
Double M, we balling way harder than Puff and them
It ain't no love loss, I only see one boss
You looking at him when they got the guns going off
And all the bitches on the staff and they get a check
So bust it open, never test a nigga intellect
Color money
Color money
Color money

We at the condo, let's have a pool party
Ain't no space in the garage, I got a new Buggati
 Double M-G
 Yeah
I heard a young nigga had to sell his soul
For a new Bugatti and a ton of gold
Stepping in the crib, I gotta pat you down
So old school, still in my cap and gown
The lawn manicured and it's well lit
Talking whole sale, each 12-6
Order crab legs with the heavy butter
.357, perpetrator stumbles
Shots fired, and I fear the worst
Gift wrap his ass, December 1st
Underneath the tree, can a nigga sleep?
Yea I went and spent a hundred G's on a V
One point five for the transport
Car got a letter B all on the asshole
Fuck a Swiss account, I got it all cash
If it's any problem, you can bring 'em all back
Know how a hustler move, do what he gotta do
Fuck the prosecutor, tell him the Bugatti's new
One point five settle all these civil suits
Platinum a million time, record in a silver suit
The whole city screaming "Where that boy Diddy at?"
Blue Yankee fitted, boy I brought the city back
I'm a Harlem nigga, I'm a Ciroc boy
Fuck a penthouse, I bought the block boy
Bought a Vacheron in London, costs a million pounds
Fuck a chick all in the shower like I'm trying to drown
Turn my back just like a king, I let her wipe me down
I'm Sean John down to my jeans, how you like me now
Hating ass niggas not my type of crowd
Gotta get a fade before I wear the crown
I hope you brought some money since you talking loud
We sipping Blue Dot and we smoking loud
I scoop a new broad just to knock her down
I get a new broad when she not around
Fuck a phone bill, bitch I'm worth a bill
She wanna feel the rush, I give her sugar hill
One point five for the transport
Car got a letter B all on the asshole
Fuck a Swiss account, I got it all cash
If it's any problem, you can bring 'em all back
Know how a hustler move, do what he gotta do
Fuck the prosecutor, tell him the Bugatti's new
One point five settle all these civil suits
Platinum a million time, record in a silver suit
Yeah, like that
Aiyyo I know you niggas see us
And I know your bitches feel us
You know what it is Maybach Music
Omarion.. Rozay..
She fell in love with a dope boy
Black diamonds on the neck of that dope boy
Big body Benz for that dope boy
Love every tattoo on that dope boy
She sheds tears for that dope boy
Shit, it is what it is for that dope boy
Handle minor biz for that dope boy
But the reward is major, so on and so forth
She can tell you by the Greyhound
She can show you how to stay down
I can tell you 'bout to break down
VS1's all in my bitch watch face now
Straight G's for your low esteem
A.P's for the whole team
As I run away from my obituary
Walkin' in the shit that'll get you buried
Miami's mine like I'm Pat Riley
Baselines shooters nigga, act wisely
Get the picture, niggas gettin' richer now
Livin' next to bitches, out on Fisher Isle
Down from Oprah, Don King, and Sosa
Come to the coca, callate la boca
They let shit slide when my nigga won't
Remember God forgives and them triggers don't
Aw baby, it's just how it goes
Can't feel it but I know you know
Cause I keep it on the outside of you, girl
And I keep it on the outside of you, girl
And I'm reaping just what I've sewn
My heart's beating but it still stay froze
And you're waiting on the inside for me, girl
And you're waiting on the inside
Arms wide open 
Arms wide open  ooh

Arms wide open 
Arms wide open  ooh

She fell in love with the lifestyle
Paper tag now her neck all iced out
Lear jets to the fights now
Belagio crap table with the dice out
Floor seats at the Heat game
Her bag 20 grand, nigga, peep game
South beach makin' love on the rooftop
Fuckin' to the rhythm, got her singin' like she Jill Scott
I'm just a nigga with a attitude
Earnin' revenue through different avenues
One of my soldiers died in Attica
Anythin' other than to ride is out of character
Top down and it feels right
I could tell you what a dope boy feels like
I could tell you that he never sleeps
He may smile but it's never sweet
Swisha burnin' at his fingertips
Tears on the inside but they never drip
God forgives and the courts don't
Seekin' an appeal when the courts won't
Aw baby, it's just how it goes
Can't feel it but I know you know
Cause I keep it on the outside of you, girl
And I keep it on the outside of you, girl
And I'm reaping just what I've sewn

Ice Cube lookin' nigga, you know life a bitch
I once got no allowance, now I got the crown
I said I was The Boss, nobody made a sound
Really had to see them things, this level story tellin'
Who else could flip a chorus into 40 million?
Out in Cannes with Leonardo DiCaprio
While out on bond, pray I go to trial rapido
Eight felonies, tellin' me wanna give me life
Every nut I bust, really, I gotta do it twice
Ricky Ronaldo, really when I'm in Portugal

I may name my daughter Hermes
Get Margiela to decorate the new birds nest
20 million up at Merrill Lynch
I met his chick, he haven't seen her since
Through the city, I'm still floatin' like a magic carpet
She stop me for a selfie, I just want the knowledge
Expressin' what you think'll send your kids to college
Or be a Geechi nigga just to keep the Bentley polished
Do it for the dear departed, fuck a Ben Carson
Empire rented, you've made a nigga a target
Only one that's smokin' up in Goldman Sachs
But I'm the only one that's rollin' like a quarter back
And I never put it in my government
'Cause I never put on for the government
Uh, I think she like me

Pussy niggas lookin' for me, I'ma give it to 'em
Santorini, Greece, sex in the swimmin' pool
If her pussy dry, call her Beetle Juice
I'm baby-makin' in them Andes
Put up all the yachts, pulled out the jetskis
Khaled hit me on the FaceTime 
I'm the flyest nigga on his bassline
She see the sneakers and she see the stones
Fat boy run the city, seated in the throne

Maybach MusicDo you know what we are going to do? We are going to defend ourselves because Huey P. Newton says that, "Power is the ability to define phenomena and make it act in a desired manner." Power is the ability to define phenomena and make it act in a desired manner. Power: if we have the ability to define it, the only next thing to do is get organized. So when a pig walks up to you, or when a pig gets to jiving with the people you be so organized you be learning some tactics, you be learning some revolutionary principles, you be having some guns hid out somewhere, you have some proper tactics that when the pig gets to jiving with you, the pig is wrong, you whip your guns out on him, blow him away, and then you have made the ability, in fact, you have made that pig act in a desired manner
Smokin' a fat spliff in a brand new Benz
No I.D. on the track, let the story begin, begin
Hah, yeah
Lookin' in the mirror but I don't see much
Still runnin' the streets so I don't sleep much
Watchin' the snakes so they don't creep up
But the way I'm gettin' this money, niggas can't keep up
You niggas can't keep up
Niggas got beef but it can’t be much
I'm still walkin' through the crowds like I can't be touched
Top back all black, Gretzky puck
Ice skater lil' later might let me fuck
Damn, she might let me fuck
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this?
Vacheron on my wrist a year ago
I didn't even know the bitches exist
Quarter milli for the mothafucka
No insurance on the mothafucka
Ain't life a bitch?
But you gotta keep her wet
Keys open doors so I gotta keep a set
Everybody know that I'm a lotta people's threat
Biggie Smalls in the flesh livin' life after my death
Yesterday I read my horoscope
Tell me Lord will I be poor and broke?
Tell me Lord will I be dealin' dope?
I wanna take my momma to the Poconos
But only Lord knows
Goodbye, to all the loved ones I leave behind
At least they can't see me cry
And I ask, when someone wants to be me, whyyyy
Thought havin' everything would ease my mind
If you could read my mind
My God, I'm scarred, I have tattoo tears of joy
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this?
Young rich motherfucker still uneducated
But dammit a nigga made it
Goddamn a nigga made it
Crib bigger than a church, Lord know I'm blessed
Five different lawyers, Lord know I’m stressed
A punch in the face get you 300K
Ask Vlad, now he back to makin' minimum wage
Another victim of my criminal ways
I wanna walk in the image of Christ
But that bitch Vivica nice
And I'm still swimmin' in ice
I'm just livin' my life
I'm just livin' my life
Lease a Lamborghini for your pussy rate
Life is just a pussy race
Snatch a bitch take her back to your place
Next morning I can tell you how the pussy taste
I got expensive taste
Goodbye, to all the loved ones I leave behind
At least they can't see me cry
And I ask, when someone wants to be me, whyyyy
Thought havin' everything would ease my mind
If you could read my mind
My God, I'm scarred, I have tattoo tears of joy
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did we do to deserve this?
Not to dwell on the the past but to keep it real
I gotta represent for Emmett Till
All the dead souls in the field
Lookin at my Rollie it's about that time
White man had a problem with mine
And we suppose to be shy?
The revolution's televised
Bobby still on the rise
Goodbye, to all the loved ones I leave behind
At least they can't see me cry
And I ask, when someone wants to be me, whyyyy
Thought havin' everything would ease my mind
If you could read my mind
My God, I'm scarred, I have tattoo tears of joyHere we are
The world is ours
From the block to boulevards
The rain is gone
The rain is gone
The rain is gone
From the block to boulevards
The rain is gone
The rain...
This shit make me feel a certain kind of way
Huh, this shit feel good right here
This shit feel like, some Carol City shit right here
My nigga Peanut, rest in peace
See you would felt this right here
I'm on my Convertible Burt shit
I'm feelin' myself, hope you feelin' me too
God forgives and I don't, unforgettable dude
I'm ballin' my nigga, and that's word to your mama
I want you to ride, definition of honor
Honor thy brother, but murder these hoes
Always pay your taxes, never pay these hoes
Always making moves, I didn't make the rules
I'm just making ends meet with this plate of food
Went from Spaghetti-O's to a new set of Vogues
Back to square one, we still was selling those
My Tribe Called Quest, shit was nice dawg
Gucci was Q-Tip, I was Phife Dawg
On the world tours with all the wrong whores
Had the right ideas, and all the wrong stores
Timing is everything, rhyming is everything
Geechi Liberace, put diamonds in everything
Here we are
The world is ours
From the block to boulevards
The rain is gone
The rain
Yeah man, ya heard?
I rock Chanel nigga, yeah, Skateboard, heh
They say "Skateboard, you racist
You only hang with white Cubans"
Nonsense, that's the necklace nigga, the light's moving
This is jewelry, that shit is foolery
Frozen water on my neck nigga, who cool as me?
Up in mansion like the black Kurt Cobain
My nigga Ross said he's the boss, 'cause he works cocaine
And under no certain circumstances
Will the facets of the diamonds not be disrespectful
And hurt your chain, and your feelings
Yeah they villains but I'm chilling, I'm still a N.E.R.D
Millions and millions and millions off of verbs
Well my niggas be stealing and killing and thrilling for the birds
Making deals, squeezing the life out of them Nextel chirps
I'm on my iPhone 
Bitches put their naked pictures on my iPad
The doors go up and I gone
Black boy scoring his life, I'm scoring the Oscars 
Remember I used to want a Pasha and eat some lobster
But now I eat the apple with my A-P
Your life and your wrist got the wrong timing, you hate me
Says the little boy that loves you, who had the ashy feet
Now I wear that ashy white suit out in Fashion Week
Where the upper-classes meet, that's just me
...I smash the beat
Here we are
The world is ours
From the block to boulevards
The rain is gone
The rain
Uhh, dedication to motivation, gave 'em motives to hate me
Old homies betrayed me, running around saying they made me
But when I had a quarter, they had, four and the baby
It was a whole different story, but fuck them niggas is shady
Now I'm self-made, self-paid, and I give myself a raise
Whole circle shining nigga, never had no selfish ways
Never had nobody tell me 'go and get it' tell me 'save'
Had to learn on my own, ask my Mama I was gone
Puffing purple getting stoned, trying to take the pain away
Now its Rolls Royces, umbrellas for a rainy day
Old heads told me "young fella, this ain't the game to play!"
Had to take the chance, told the dealer, "deal my hand"
And now that nigga's getting murdered, shit is getting scary
I put mirror tint all in the Ghost, I'm screaming Bloody Mary
Nigga Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary
Let 'em cross the line of scrimmage, they get fucking buried
They had me cutting through that field just like a rushing Barry
Slammers play with hammers
Had them birds but we don't fuck with Larry
I was just trying to ball, ducking D's and grinding raw
But now I pull up in that thing
Them niggas gon' need some Tylenol, I'm gone!
Here we are
The world is ours
From the block to boulevards
The rain is gone
The rain
I'm staring at my notepad like goodbye to my broke past
Words full of money, use dollar signs as my periods
I'm gettin money - period!
They said I got a old soul and I'm rich nigga spirited
So one time for the old-timers and two for the new school
Three for my Geechi niggas with big Rollies in that new coupe
Blowing on loud, sipping on that dirty juice
With a tre-deuce, living life like they ain't made loot
'Cause what's here today could be gone tomorrow
So I'ma get it myself
I ain't known to ball, make sure my kids is straight
In case I'm gone tomorrow
Young Bonaparte, I'm noble dog like Drew Ali
Dark shades like Kool Moe Dee, cool fly nigga is who I be
Big chain with a bigger charm
Leave with a bad chick under my arm
Uhh! Geechi Liberace
Diamonds on everything, even my posse
Here we are
The world is ours
From the block to boulevards
The rain is gone
The rain is gone
The rain is gone
From the block to boulevards
The rain is gone
The rain...I just left the new United States embassy
Somewhere in Georgia it's 109 rooms
I saw 30 bitches and 30 rooms and I was on the wrong side of the house
Oh
Anytime me and Scott Scorch get together you gotta call us the Illuminati
Whenever you see the G it represents God and geometry
That's what the stencil's for
I'ma take you deeper though
Nah, I'm just fuckin' with you
Aye, Scott, I'm just fuckin' with you, baby
Yo
Speedin' in the Ghost on the phone with jewelers
My new bitch out of D.C., call me Ricky the Ruler
Gotta gather my concentration while countin' my stacks
I got eight car notes and just lost me a pack
On the beach, I'm up and down, women jockin' my ride
300 horses in this bitch, need a jockey inside
False floors for firearms is how you should ride
Tried to murder me while in mine so that's how I survived
My new deal with Def Jam just set me for life
Warner to Chappell to BMI, I'm just rollin' the dice
Big numbers, I'm John Wall, I'm ballin' tonight
Just jokin', my sense of humor is like one of a kind
Got them gangstas who on my line that'll blow out your mind
Got them gangstas who on my line that'll blow out your mind
Got them gangstas who on my line that'll blow out your mind
Got them gangstas who on my line that'll blow out your mind
Tell me it's real
Tell me this is real, baby
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
Geechi Liberace, I’m rich as a bitch
Charm city boys get a whole city of brick
Through the wire we wettin' niggas, set the shit on fire
My bitch smilin' I wanna bet, now we on Fisher Isle
Panamera with Tony Draper, briefcase full of paper
Made a killin' on Martin Luther James Earl shooter
My niggas, we grew apart, they joined the rival gang
Caught them slippin', gave them a pass throwin' pistols at survivin' gang
Next time boss gotta turn his back on 'em
Lettin' young boys brrrrat on 'em
Facts, never find me with the fake look
Trappin' little babies, bitch, just take me to the cakebook
Black bottles, boy, that's how our case of ace look
Your chick, homie, hit homie on the Facebook
Damn, she hit homie on the motherfuckin' Facebook
Tell me it's real, I wanna know
How does it feel, yeah, how does it feel?
Clean Maybach, but I'm filthy as shit
The partition is for the women, how busy we get
From the scotch, the large mop, bet the linkin' feel
It's all a dream and never wake me up until it's real
Duffle bags, that's for the homie when he comin' home
He never told and he never used the telephone
He on swole and that nigga need a telephone
In a Range Rover and a real nigga got it for him
Hey, hey...
You wanna know how does it feel
Hey, hey...
I know, I bet it must feel so real
Hey, hey...
Tell me it's real, I wanna know hey hey ey
How does it feel to be so real
You know when hangin' with billion dollar niggas
One of the perks is gettin' to meet all these billion dollar bitches
I just met a bitch who never gets jetlag
And spent 10 thousand dollars on not her best bag
You underdig thatMaybach Music
Oh, I see how this go
I see how these niggas moving
It's not a problem
I can adapt to it
Check
When you get a lil' paper, get ready for haters
They standing in line, they all suffer from vapors 
I got me a ghost, I took off the tint 
Bitch look at my face, I'm a grown-ass man
I'm buying real estate  and I'm building my plans
Can't name a realer place , going gram for gram
And all the killers, they know who the fuck I am
Look in a nigga face , watch me count my grams
My dog my trigger mate , and we bout them games
I'm talking trigger play , never safe for lames
Just beat another charge, made 'em drop that case
My lawyers going hard , a nigga versus the state
Just bought another car , had to drop that top
For 200 dollars, she-a suck that cock
'Cause when you seen with me , I'ma up that stock
I got that green with me, Gucci got those blocks
A nigga cheese dripping , I like my nachos hot
As far as green niggas, yeah, you might get got 
Breaking down my key, tryna see me the most 
Greenhouse on the couch, niggas seeing me toast 
Niggas making the threats, you could put 'em on Twitter 
But out of respect, I handle mine like a killer
I'm running the city like a pair of new J's
Maybe the patent 11s, I got these hoes in a daze 
Panamera parade  sippin Cir'c lemonade 
Baby, drop me a eighth  and baby boy straight 
In the back of the ghost, I can hear no whispers
In the back of your mind, you wanna be that nigga

Maybach Music!
Walkin' through the crib you can hear the waterfalls
Like the projects out in Philly bumpin' "I'm a boss"
If I'm feeling shorty you know I'ma floss
Did my thing in the summer my money somersault
Now I'm at the dealer with the worst credit
Got a yellow carat now I smoke lettuce
Let her count my bread she a bank teller
Can you keep a secret? I'm a rich nigga
Got the new ghost in the drop 2
That's 800 racks when I stop through
Dealing with the same team talking way back
Now I deal with big cream theme Maybach
Shes a thoroughbred, so her bags new
Welcome to the fam that's a 100 rack move
All in a duffel, baby, you could call it yours
Countin' all day now I call it chores
You inherit real estate when you stay in line
Can you imagine even livin' in my state of mind?
Strawberry swisha sweets in my Aston
Bumpin' slim dunkin' tryin' to live this life of mine
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can't understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again
With everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it
Look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the..
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can't understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again
I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see that guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin' at the..
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can't understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again
Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in the broken mirror
I see my mama smile that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message could've been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the..
MJ taught me that
Take 'em to Mars, man
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can't understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again
Hey B.P., looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time?
So why are we, talking to each other again...Huh

What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
Prime 112 behind the double doors
As I rewind the devils floors
Paths cross, of course your life lost
"Patience a virtue. Heard that you're the boss"
Your informant's correct
Now give me enormous respect
Cornered the game, record label on his chain
Right hand on the bible watch the flow catch flame
Margielas on her feet
Now she riding with a lame all jealous in the Jeep
All the lil homies wanna eat
But we never settle beef
So settle your debts before there's any regrets
Gino do the graffitti and Black Evander with the Tech
My girls say that I'm a mess
DJ Khaled say I'm the best
And my city do too
20 in the trunk, that's how city boys move
8.9, now the crib got a view
Mandarin manicure, DEA in pursuit
Champagne and a Rolex, Rose
No church for a d-boy: let's pray
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
Ain't no church in the wild
For a nigga like me in the game so foul
In a world full of sin where the love flow thin
And the pain run deep 'cause it's blood in the streets
See the stains on the money, no love for the weak
Where it rain, never sunny, just mud on a beach
Where a hater sticks to you like mud on a cleat
Thanksgiving with them birds, just drugs for a feast
Young'un only 13 with a snub in his fleece
Even though his heart's cold, he in love with the heat
See the high in his eyes, hear the slugs in his speech
From the bottom out of Philly, I emerge from the east
Peace! At the dealer, talking Bugatti talk 
You never heard it like 'Luminati talk 
Tell 'em haters that it's my mama fault
Breaking bricks, you would think we talking karate talk
Young niggas with old money
Never trust a nigga that said "Let me hold something"
Never trust a bitch that tell you she ain't blown nothing
The weathermen ain't never tell me 'bout these cold summers
Tears dripped on my dad casket
Niggas turned me into a bastard 
Glock .40 on me is plastic
Get to reaching, I'm squeezing on him and clapping 
And I ain't talking 'bout assemblies
I'm talking headshots where niggas won't remember me
I asked God, "Please remove my enemies"
I was surprised when I lost niggas that was friends of me
Human beings in a mob 
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wildFucking you, fucking you

Mean hustle got me chasin' all this fast money
Balenciaga sneakers, now she touchin' cash money
So sexy in them all black Giuseppe heels
50 stacks in her bag so she know it’s real
Top off the Ferrari now we thugged out

Twenty-four karat gold, eighty carats worth of ice
Ice insured, fuck life insurance
I live for the moment, and put a bullet on that 
Got the club rockin' like a fuckin' boat
I'm the pirate on this ship, all you mates got to go
Good party over here, everybody over here
You know the word travel fast, everybody know we here
All the bottles over here, even spread it over there
All the models over here, but they swallow everywhere

And we 'bout to hit Jacob the Jeweler
So I can be like Slick Rick, and rule ya
Dr. Martin Louis the King, Junior
And I'mma never let the dream turn to Kruegers
My outfit so disrespectful
You can go 'head and sneeze cause my presence blessed you
I mean, we walked in this bitch so stylish
Niggas done mistook me for my stylist
And I know it's superficial and you say it's just clothes
But we shoppin' in that motherfucker and they just closed
So go ahead and just pose
When she walked up out the dressing room, the store just froze
And I know they tryna get they cool back
And them ghetto bitches hollin' "How you do that?"
Uhh, so they could never say we never lived it

I studied Kenneth Williams, I'm one hell of a student
Remarkable hustle, my niggas comin' home
I kept the candle lit, my nigga never rowed
Niggas caught him slippin', gave him a shit bag
Five shots to the stomach, 2Pac gift pack
It's death row, conspiracy theories
Concealed indictments handed to the grand jury
Get some money now, you hated by your own kind
The home invasion done by niggas in your bloodline
GABOS, game ain’t based on sympathy
So he put a hit on his cousin and auntie
Her sweet potato pies, oh me, oh my
Showin' no remorse, watchin the others cry
Heroin sales, detectives'll sell
A lot of yellow tape, where that Obama care?
This the mob, bitch, silk underwear
Yeezy concerts, Kim Instagrams
Niggas hatin', though they studied my moves
I'm like Farrakhan, in view of hundreds of Jews
Two attempts on my life, they threatened venues
Can't you see what I am? The hustle continue
I bought more jewels, I ordered the Wraith
I got a new style of shoes, match the watch in the face
Bill Belichick, coachin' and callin' the shots
Throw a yellow flag, pussy nigga body drops

Your mami house next, tell that bitch to duck
Ain't no sympathy in the inner city streets

To my Maybach music
Martin, Louie the King Jr
Startin' all that stuntin' is gon' ruin you
If B.I. was alive, he'd prob'ly have the 2-tone
With the Grey Poupon, anything 'Ye poop on
Will explode, 'cause I am the shit, and this is my commode
Uh-oh, there they go
Talking 'bout how your boy's clothes extra tight
I just remembered that my limelight extra bright
I hit the strip club and girls get extra hype
You hit the strip club and girls turn extra dyke
We know who not getting no sex tonight
And a lap dance'd probably be a blessin', right?
So all the shit you talking dead, coffin
Like the weed, coughing, new crib, loft in
Where it's at? Austin, where is that? Texas
What's in front? Benzes, what else? Lexus
Well, who's Maybach is this? Mr. West's!
Hey! Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homie, I'ma make back
Can you believe that? Whoa-ooh-ooh
You gotta see it 
'Cause I don't plan on goin' broke, put that on my Maybach
'Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music
To my Maybach music
Boss!
Kush burn like petroleum, crib needs custodians
Shades in all shades, these made of rhodium
Used to be the Oldsmo, hoes call it oh-lo
Now I got so many horses, bitches call me Polo
57, 62, tell me how you wanna move
Yeah, you know I got them both, beat your ass black and blue
 I was barely gettin' pretty women
Now I scoop Emmy winners like kitty litter
Any winter, Fendi denim like a slender nigga
Lookin' in the mirror, I can see the real contender
Celery for Eben Gregory, I'm on my dinner
So what the fuck is you telling me other than your gender?
I'm a boss, and I'm ridin' like a small Vogue
Niggas make your wheels and ride 'em 'til they fall off
Yeah! Ross!
Hey! Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homie, I'ma make back
Can you believe that? Whoa-ooh-ooh
You gotta see it 
'Cause I don't plan on goin' broke, put that on my Maybach
'Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music
To my Maybach music
Well, all right!
Hehehe
All-black Maybach, I'm sittin' in the asshole
Classy as a mother, still gutter like a bad bowl
Benjamin Franklin on X how that cash roll
That's right, them mils do, like damp clothes
I eat your meal, too, we don't feel you
And we be strapping up like the Navy SEAL do
Sweet as banana-split every time I peel through
Fresher than Will Smith and Uncle Phil too
Watching TV in the Maybach in traffic
I'm on my feet like Tough-Actin' Tinactin
I'm running this shit, you should try tackling
Lil Wayne in one word? Immaculate
You see the Biggie, see the Jay, the 2Pac in him
The Kurt Cobain, the Andre Three Stacks
And then I'm back to doin' shit like I do's it
Maybach Music!
Hey! Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach 
Whatever I send out, homie, I'ma make back 
Can you believe that? Whoa-ooh-ooh 
You gotta see it 
'Cause I don't plan on goin' broke, put that on my Maybach
'Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music
To my Maybach musicHeh, what is this? 
I like this Maybach music
 Hahahaha
Come and take a ride
Come and take a, come and take a ride
Billionaire, yayo
57, yes, yes, good for a D-Boy
Hand my MAC-11 to the engineer to record
Got the baddest women in the world for me to feed on
Double deck yacht, docked Boss, blowin' weed up
Revenue incredible, it put me on a pedestal
Columbia to Mexico, I figured was a better route
Look at me, a model now, models and them bottles 'round
A Blood holla, "Ballin,'" but the boys in blue, they shot 'em down
Gang-affiliated, colors prosecutors painted
Cause the niggas I employed name synonymous with mayhem
Instrumentals that are mental, Maybach kind of mental
400 off the lot, the block is monumental 
Some things your money can't buy
Like Heaven in the sky, even a better ride
In the rear, so many instruments I hear
Tucked behind curtain, no sign to fear
I'm higher than a lear, this Maybach music
Designer shit I wear, make hoes lose it 
Close your eyes and inhale the smoke
It's Maybach music, the realest shit I wrote, nigga
By an ounce, take a toke
Of this Maybach music, the realest shit I wrote
Boss!
It's Young!
Hahahah, fuck it then
Black Maybach, white seats, black pipin'
Remind me of Paul McCartney and Mike fightin'
You know, "The Girl Is Mine"
Life's a bitch, so the whole world is mine
The six-deuce long, the curtains are drawn
Perfectly like a Picasso, Rembrandts and Rothkos
I'm a major player, 40/40's in Vegas at the Palazzo
They said it was not so
Certain things your money can't buy
Like being this fly, 'til then, I'm just gon' ride
I'm like G Rap with better transportation
On the road to the riches, reach my final destination
In the lear, closer to Aaliyah, say a prayer
Hope I get to see her when I disappear from here, baby, yeah
But I don't see the endin' through these millionaire lenses
Just the two M's on the emblem
The partition roof, translucent and humidor
Refrigerators, where Ace of Spades or two I store
True story, my closet is like two stories
Straight to the happy endin', cause I don't do stories
Shawn Corey, real rap
The Maybach is bananas—peel back
Hahahah, you feel that? Young, c'mon
Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach
8-track episodes, been doin' this since way back
Since way back, since way back
8-track episodes, been doin' this since way back
Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach
8-track episodes, been doin' this since way back
Since way back, since way back
8-track episodes, been doin' this since way back
Boss, can't be stopped now
We got too much cake
They pinchin' pennies, while I'm musclin' for mills
And that muscle be that muzzle, when I stuff it in your grill
Stuffed shells, thanks to crack, I crack crab and lobsters
Not all mobsters imposters, gotcha
Boy, I got a eagle view, standin' on my balcony
Can only stay a week or two, so many people out for me
I bulletproofed the Maybach, got a killer's intuition
Holdin' on that MAC-11, Makaveli premonition
Waitin' on my Suge Knight, one nation under God
Since I chose a thug's life, guess I gotta play my part
Never will I die, my name symbolized
The hustle for young killers coming from the other side
Some things your money can't buy
Like Heaven in the sky, even a better ride
I'm large, my black car, menagin' black broads
Massage for frauds, I'm livin' large, my fat rocks
It's eat to kill in the field of hip-hop
Runnin' up on the car, you get popped, mopped and dropped
I'm the bossThere's so many things that I don't understand. Sometimes, being in the position I am, with no malicious intent, my nigga, you can take it how you want it. I see it from both sides, I feel a nigga pain
Learn to walk a tightrope
Ever seen a rich nigga go broke?
They putting liens on a nigga's things
Publicize your demise, and by all means
Your family fortune is forever what you stood on
Sold dreams, fantasies that put the hood on
You reap what you sow, and they speaking repossessions
To the culture itself, these are powerful lessons
These niggas always smiled when I came around
They let you know my reputation when you in my town
A real nigga, you gonna know that by the contract
Bottom line blood, show me where them one’s at
That paper it get funny when publishing is involved
Mechanicals never mattered because that was your dog
Now you hands-on, but things don’t ever seem right
You make a call to give your lawyer the green-light
He look into it then hit you up with the bad news
It’s so familiar, he did the same with the last dudes
Mafioso, baby girl, cash rules
Every dollar accounted for, double M the crew
Death Row, fast life
Foreclosed on my past life
The white man call us stupid niggas
We spend it all, nothing for our children
Had it all, now it’s repossessed
Can’t feed the clique cutting bad checks
Time to learn boy, that cash rules
Success is a precious jewel
Planting poison in a nigga mind
Chilling with your boys when it’s time to grind
We both come from those humble beginnings
Still can’t believe we never followed each other on Twitter
Funny thing is the animosity money brings
Real niggas out of style we may be one in three
Back against the wall outnumbered by fuckboys
One bullet, one target, one choice
You can take an L or take the shell
It's still double M still making mills
Made niggas respect my hustle on both coasts
I put the word out to see who hit back with the lowest
I need a hit handled, put me in touch with the closest
You still digging through ashtrays killing the roaches
And I never took an L back when Meek fell
Just drove the numbers all the way back up at retail
Death Row, fast life
Foreclosed on my past life
The white man call us stupid niggas
We spend it all, nothing for our children
Had it all, now it’s repossessed
Can’t feed the clique cutting bad checks
Time to learn boy, that cash rules
Success is a precious jewel
Can’t be writing checks with your eyes closed
While you living out of homes in different time zones
Mind blown finna strip you out your rhinestones
Pistol to your ear, this that level I’m on
I apologize woadie but this all I got
Everybody in this office we could die tonight
I never met an artist who fully recouped
These the deals the deal  dealers wanna deal to you
Young niggas, time to act your wage
Buying belts you seen on other niggas waists
Hoes fucking for follows, they wanna post online
Whole time, shorty knowing I’m not gon' mind
Put it on all he needed was a co sign
Black minks and gloves, nigga, the whole nine
TV on the Rolls, shit, I had to hold mine
You’ll foreclose or fold just for soul signs
Death Row, fast life
Foreclosed on my past life
The white man call us stupid niggas
We spend it all, nothing for our children
Had it all, now it’s repossessed
Can’t feed the clique cutting bad checks
Time to learn boy, that cash rules
Success is a precious jewel
Success is a precious jewel
Success is a precious jewelSomebody call the Brinks truck

I got the baddest bitches waiting on a nigga
I got these pussy niggas hating on a nigga
Since they wanna talk, I went and bought another chain
Forty cars, I gotta put em in my momma name
Heli-pad on my crib, my money outta here
Love my daughter to death, ten karats in her ear
Heavy ammunition for you fuck boys
Heavy ammunition for you fuck boys
I'm getting paid, I put that on my daddy grave
Got two hundred thousand in my Chevrolet
I'm the king of diamonds, my chain still speaking Ebonics
If she selling that pussy, bring it to baby, I got it
Pop a chicken in that grease and make one into two
All these rides in my yard, my shit a carnival
I got a plug, he a O'ye
So show me love, it's only one Rozay
Rozay!
Rozay!
Rozay!
You gotta separate yourself from fuck boys
Can't even drop your top, because your ass so paranoid
I'm floating in my shit like I'm in a parade
Ho, you better take notes -- I spent ten on the paint
Waving at these bitches, and I know these niggas ho-ish
Take your bitch to get lemon pepper in a new Lotus
I'm so rich, I mean I'm so rich
If it's less than ten stacks, to me it's ho shit
It's time to step your game up
Gotta run your credit just to bring my name up

I can't dance good but I'mma dance tonight, you hear me?
Baby just don't step on my feet, a nigga toes hurting
Uh, uh
Funny to see a ghetto nigga so classy
Enchanted by women who speak nasty
Tip toeing to court, went there for the past week
Leaning on my lawyer, pinky looking glassy
Charges dropped, these plaintiffs just wanna tax me
Secret Service wanna see me driving taxis
Hug my attorney and then we do the money dance
Whitey Bulger or a soldier leaving Vietnam
Pledge allegiance to the flag
Where we keep it 100 or get your money back
Pull a plug, brain dead, dope game nigga
Knew the rolls was fake and so we brought the real with us
Repertoire, hustle such a tenacity
High roller, bet us another masterpiece
More Rakim then maybe Master P
Crazy nigga paid in full, I'm tryna buy the beach
Caution, I'll approach you with a business mind
Slight two-step as I check the time
Rub my hands when my palms itch
50 in the bank, diamonds looking flawless
This the sway of a rich nigga
Praying for the day my nigga seeing six figures
Black bottles popping when I'm on the turf
Two private jets what a nigga's worth
No girl, under 10
No whip under a hundred grand
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Man I make this money dance
I Chris Craft, she suntans
Propellers out the window over islands
Where I land
Girl, we make that money dance
Top Forbes, poor formal education
Top floors, cop rooms on reservations
Gold in my grave, half a ticket in my coupe
Ex-cheerleader flipping now this nigga true
Money piles have got me out on Sunny Ave
Black with me everywhere I go, he'll gun you down
Full clips, magazines, yeah the Forbes list
If it's off a nickel, recount it, it's boss shit
But when they right, we do the money dance
Fly nigga, my nigga Randall Cunningham
When she hear the slang then she know the name
Italian suits for the gooks, I spend it on the chain
Pool so long, we should take a swim
I like that ass fat, I can spread it thin
I wanna see your friends come do the money dance
Black Bottle Boys, we got these bitches holding hands
Caution, I'll approach you with a business mind
Slight two-step as I check the time
Rub my hands when my palms itch
50 in the bank, diamonds looking flawless
This the sway of a rich nigga
Praying for the day my nigga seeing six figures
Black bottles popping when I'm on the turf
Two private jets what this nigga's worth
No girl, under 10
No whip under a hundred grand
Man I make this money dance
I Chris Craft, she sun tans
Propellers out the window over islands
Where I land
Girl, we make that money dance

Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Uh, I feel wonderful, how about yourself?
You rolling with the real niggas, you know we got it
Check, uh
As the world turn and the weed twist
Flew a hundred niggas to Vail on a ski trip
Put away the dope, we can see the slopes
We built this shit together why it mean the most
Head-on collision, somehow I walk away
Give you music for free, recouping with the yay
You're rocking with the bowtie don
In God we trust, I bust and post bond
In the hood, we the Run-DMCs
Best quotes and ropes we don't need
Death Row on foul like Cool C
Big flossy, the bitches like "Who's he?"
The corvette was a beast, I had to lease
Six months then we're free to holler "Peace!"
Dead wrong my nigga, Miami river cops
Leave you floating there, hope of getting them ten a pop
Caution, I'll approach you with a business mind
Slight two-step as I check the time
Rub my hands when my palms itch
50 in the bank, diamonds looking flawless
This the sway of a rich nigga
Praying for the day my nigga seeing six figures
Black bottles popping when I'm on the turf
Two private jets what this nigga's worth
Atlanta, Miami, Rosé
We like 2Pac and Vante
They sent my nigga on house arrest
I'm coming through nigga, they ain't stopping this
I bring the beach to the front door
All bitches out the pool, we need to park the boat
Turn South Georgia to Florida
And turn the rest over to the lawyers
Cause we ain't tryna hurt nobody
Just tryna bring life to the party
If I ain't change your mind, think whatever
One thing you can't change is I changed the weather
And this my Roc-A-Fella flow
And you just on hella dope, I'm hella dope

All debts forgiven, this is the payback

Francis Ford, fuckin' with them hoes
You niggas still can't afford
Made so many mistakes I know that my niggas relate
Just to rattle my cage, so much shit they sat on my plate
She know me through records, but she don't know me too well
All this game is for sale was priceless, I keep for myself
Shots fired, man expired in his Jordan 3's
Small talk, turn that page, that's all they ever read
You graduated, you still unemployed
Taken for granted, love is null and void
No longer one and few, young Langston Hughes
Jewish intuition, I'm followin' cues
Niggas own Versace, don't know Nikki Giovanni
Your paper chasin', can't see that it's runnin' from you
My homies from the block, they labeled me cunnin'
No excuse for my success, so they say I'm Masonic
I keep it one hundred, fuck her, I keep the car runnin'
How she fuck on the back, that's to keep food in the stomach
Look at me, look at me
Realest shit you niggas ever seen
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me
Playin' for keeps, and that's just to say at the least

Heavy artillery, death to enemies number one
Francis Ford, flows you niggas can't ignore
Shoppin' with them hoes you niggas can't afford

Fuck a net worth when I'm just trynna maintain
Tennessee, I felt like Mr. Wendal, nigga
When ain't nobody starin' out that window with you
Obligated, surrounded, when you are often hated
Left a bag of that dope when they flew off to Vegas
It was written, Mr. Jones, a different picture
Strong as bones like Corleones, the realest figures
Speakin' in native tongues, me, myself and I
Through Michael Rapaport eyes, it's just a lost trial
But I see the gems, I see the stars
Diabetes and all, your name will carry on
I pray this legacy is what is left of me
Corporate cannabis givin' me leprosy
Look at me, look at me

Got a sniper, drop your ass where you stand, understand?

18. HeadacheI've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In the torn up town, no post code envy
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule 
Let me live that fantasy
Silver Rolls Royce cigarette smokes in it
New fur rug now my dirty boots in 'em
Flowin' in the pocket like I'm enrollin' in a college
Mean as a dean, triple beam well polished
She wanna watch Scandal, I wanna count a handful
Dead Presidents sleep in the attic of the mansion
All I heard was murder, think the house haunted
Super Bowl tickets they bitches and and Fed chargers
Label the racketeer, John Grisham with a pen
Top three writer but number one at your event
Mastermind unfolds like a true crime
Double M gold mind for the whole time
My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule 
Let me live that fantasy
We're bigger than we ever dreamed, and I'm in love with being queen
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule 
Let me live that fantasyWhat is this?
Maybach Music
I like this Maybach Music
And we lie together, cry together
And I swear I hope we fucking die together
And I'll be loving you forever
You're all that I need to get by
I used to play hard to get, like a sample on a hook
We used to play with the pots, you told me you was a cook
I was runnin' too long, he was chasin', didn't trip
How'd he do it? I don't know but somehow I got hooked
Thug passion, he's so compassionate
MMG, yeah, that's his acronym
Call him D-A-D-D-Y like I'm in a bassinet
He in pieces, he be all up into my fashion shit
Hold on, poppin', rockin', my panties, they match my slips
Been through it all; I could give a narrative
No fiction, nah, we ain't no characters
I mean if I bust my gun, you gon' bust yours too
Type to double up, you know that I ain't gon' fuck the budget up
Type of bitch deserve it all, who gon' compete with her?
He use to have a cold heart, cold heart
Now my ring finger doin' the double dutch
And we lie together, cry together
And I swear I hope we fucking die together
And I'll be loving you forever
You're all that I need to get by
 Dream together, scream together
 And if we go to war, fuck the world together
 And I'll be loving you forever
 You're all that I need to get by
You're all that I need to get by
You're all that I need to get by
You're all that I need to get by
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let the dog roam, he found his way back
Loyal to the soil, I never change that
We go way back, I can take you way back
Used to ride Chevy's only now we in the Maybach, yeah
Caramel, she ride on top like it's a carousel
So infectious, I'm addicted, how would she ever fail
All my works are classic, maybe this my magnum opus
Too focused to give pussy to one of my soldiers
The loyalty is deep, she my Meryl Streep
My Michelle, we menage, do that through the week
On the phone, she had me listenin' to Boyz II Men
I'm tryna be at all the dope boy events
Food stamps now we dinin' on islands
Diced pineapples, now she's my piña colada
Put my coattail on my dawg I thought was my rider
Every day he wore a wire just like his designer
Some things are meant to be, some thing are meant to be
The day they sentence me, show me no sympathy
If it's the Lord's will, so be it, that boy been a 'G'
Huh, that boy been a 'G' 
You're all that I need to get by
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let the dog roam, he found his way back
Loyal to the soil, I never change that
We go way back, I can take you way back
Used to ride Chevy's only now we in the Maybach, yeah
She full of confidence, we compliment each other
Got my pistol in her purse so she a cocky nigga
She tatted up and way too trill for cover ups
We both winnin', that's even when it's one of us
We switchin' cars right before the summer comes
She my people so I'm beefin' when that trouble come
Kissin' in the club, I'm grippin' on your hips
I'm richer than before; I hit a couple licks
Travelin', I leave the keys to all the cars
The hallway just like walking through the rainforest
Before producers started sendin' tracks
Once was a dependent on the income tax
You did the math and said you'd give me half
It was genuine when we would interact
So when I got the bag, I had to double back
Let go a milli, shit, it made me off a couple racks 
You're all I need to get by
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let the dog roam, he found his way back
Loyal to the soil, I never change that
We go way back, I can take you way back
Used to ride Chevy's only now we in the Maybach, yeah
There go that nigga, swim with the big fish
It's that Chanel music
Let the dog roam, he found his way back
Givenchy
Loyal to the soil, I never change that
We go way back, I can take you way back
Used to ride Chevy's only now we in the Maybach, yeah
It's priceless
I'd rather you than me
That's all it isGod is great, first and foremost, uhh
Don't you wish everything could be so perfect?
Free enterprise, overexposed
Irritated, uneducated still scribble my flows
The jubilation, the euphoria
Pushing a foreign in the morning, pick your daughter up
Drop your seed off, let the weed up
Slow motion, fast forward till we speed up
Grinding 'til my new accountant is fully at ease
Beefing with broke niggas really like pulling my teeth
Get away from me! You looking so suspicious
Light pocket, heavy hearted, you simple minded niggas
Don't be jealous of me, I keep enough foes
Get all the sneakers, not enough clothes
You can have the ex, I got enough hoes
You can have my next, once we a month old
Reptile black, Birkin Bamboo handle
Now the trophy on the mantle, well I got a Phantom
Being down and out was inconceivable
When you find out the one you love is just misleading you
Tryna make a living, remain spiritual
Egotistical ways I embraced back in middle school
If the chick was game, we would run a train
Send her home on a bus, then forget her name
But now the bitches be the realest ones
I done cried on her shoulder when I'm feeling numb
Seen a man get life and never shed a tear
But his daughter in the night never pierced her ears
Time will come when all that nice shit disappears
Why you think I'm on the night shift with the pills?
Mind frame of that boy that was found slain
Mild slang, you can tell I been around 'caine
Double R, Ricky Ross, bitch we been the gang
Bottom of the black market, time to rise again
My inner Andre 3000, uhh
So many false allegations, is my image tainted
3 weeks in the hole, as if a nigga heinous
As I'm pacing in the cell all this pictures painted
All i wanted was some Belaire and a Danish
Inmates gave me commissary just because I'm famous
Or is it cause' I'm rich and I know what pain is?
Assassinate Trump like I'm Zimmerman
Now accept these words as they came from Eminem
Democratic party sentenced to the pendulum
Killing them, I voted for Andre Benjamin
Head of black music, do you know what rhythm is?
Stick your hand in the basket, it gets venomous
Straight player, my chicks finish my sentences
Time to squash to beef, I kill a nemesis
Show up at the wedding in my Timberlands
And for the record, know my best man'll kill a bitch
So if I die before I wake
Say I, I lived my way
Never said I would be perfect 
Never said that I deserved it 
Never said I wouldn't lie 
Never said I wouldn't make my mom cry 
But if I'm gon' die, I believe it's alright
It was so amazing, so amazing 
It was so amazing, so amazing
I wouldn't change a thing, no no no
No, ohh
It was so amazing, so amazing, ohh
It was so amazing, so amazing
I wouldn't change a thingRiding to the music, this is how we do it all night 
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, 
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
But here goes nothing
When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down bitch one that live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl that swallows what's on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space
Elroy Jetson: I'm somewhere out in space
In my two-seater she's the one that I would take
Riding to the music, this is how we do it all night 
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, 
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
But here goes nothing
Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box
Mr. KFC, VVS's in the watch
Living fast where it's all about that money bag
Never front, you take it there, it ain't no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100
Riding to the music, this is how we do it all night 
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, 
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
But here goes nothing
Would've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go whether that's right I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came -
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urgin’ all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

This is, like, exclusive

Kane Train, bitch, Kane, yeah
Yeah, the revolution is the genocide
Look, your execution will be televised
Don't cross me like Isiah, that shit be ill-advised 
Dark horse, rap black sheep, they got me vilified
Castratin' niggas in they feelings on IG 
Will never let this industry demasculinize me 
I do murder barefaced, don't need no mask to disguise me
Threw my FN in the stash, I think the cracker's behind me, damn
He pulled me over, I asked him, "Yo, what's the problem, sir?
I swerved to duck the potholes, man, I had no option, sir
Just let me go 'cause my license, insurance proper, sir
I'd hate to be on the run for smokin' an officer"
We were bustin' at police before Queen & Slim, that's on FN
Let off fifty shots to the squad car and get in the wind
Told the Gary Police in '05 that I got more guns than them
Get the feds if you want a war, and they sent them bitches in
The revolution is the genocide
Yeah, my execution might be televised
Cross niggas like Bubba Chuck, I never gave a fuck
Hook shot a ho like Kareem, but I never leave the Bucks
Sick with the Act', me and Jack, pourin' three liters up
It hurt to say I miss you, the real ones always be leavin' us
Caught up in the moment, most niggas foldin' or freezin' up
Sometimes it be your own damn homies, Judas set Jesus up
Yeah, the revolution is the genocide
Made a sex tape with your bitch, that pussy televised
Thug nigga with some exotic dreams, erotic dreams
Fuckin' hella thots, but I really want me a Scottie Beam
Shit was different when Mike left and it was Scottie team
Ex won't take me back, without me, the bitch wouldn't have got a ring
Yeah, the revolution is the genocide
Tell a ho she don't know nan', Trick Daddy, Slip-N-Slide, nigga
Kane
Uh, 305 in my yayo
Subject to let a bitch snort a line off the dashboard of my '75
Caprice, that is
Yo 
You need a dictionary when you write your raps 
Went to the penitentiary just for a hundred sack 
I had a vision back when I was fishin' for a bass
But they won't listen 'til you in your kitchen countin' cash
I got the dollars, motherfuck a nigga's credit score 
Big bag of chronic like I'm sackin' up at Interscope 
My pistol polished, any problems, I'ma pull that ho
Peter Parker, but I've yet to reach my pinnacle 
Bitches lookin' at me, shawty wanna see my soul 
All my jewelry on, she only see my gold 
I'm prayin' for my guys, pray you sing along 
I fuck bitches in my ride, I never bring 'em home
She sees just how I ride and slip her panties off
He wanted war until they hit 'em with a cannonball 
Spark spliffs, raw kicks I get from Clark Kent
Common sense, no Prince, strictly the mob hits 
Exhale weed, ship it from the West 
My brain begin to seize when I'm needin' rest 
Kobe Bryant when we speakin', very best 
I pray for Gigi, wonder if she'll get to see me next

Chea! I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a pistol in the car, a .45
If I'd die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louie, I'm talkin' all brown linen
Make all of my bitches tattoo my logo on they titty
Put a statue of a nigga in the middle of the city
Load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
Told on my partner and help them crackers give him 30
I told him I got it, therefore I gotta do ya dirty
Back on my biz, been in this bitch since 8:30
Scoop me a dime, now makin off at 10:30
Goin' on 12, go home and tell that man a lie
I got a bake sale, bitch its 30' for the pie
It's 9 for the slice, dummy that's a Dan Marino
Talkin' quarterbacks meanin talkin' quarter kilos
Niggas feel my pain, I ain't even gotta say it
Where I come from, if you open it you payin'
How I can save when all my niggas in the can?
Am I my brothers keeper? Motherfucker take my hand
Pull up to the club, I got a kilo in the car
Black card but a nigga spendin' c-notes at the bar
I'm not a star
I'm not a star
I'm not a star
I'm not a star
All black Lamborghini, smokin' on the sticky
Got a couple dollars, now this nigga think he Ricky
Pull up to the club, I got a kilo in the car
Black card but a nigga spendin' c-notes at the bar
I'm not a star
I'm not a star
I'm not a star
I'm not a star
I'm not a star, somebody lied
I spent a milly on the car, it come alive
Never feed it after dark, gotta treat it like a Gremlin
It's a multi-million dollar motherfucker in it
And I'm quick to blow a milli in a minute
I know them people wanna stick me with the sentence
I'm a player catchin' bitches like I'm TO
Trunk full of work, yeah this nigga think he Nino
Three dice yeah, grab a nigga for a kilo
Pinky ring a hundred grand but keep that on the d-low
Diddy negotiates and the paperwork to Theo
My niggas never sing, if I need 'em I go to Ne-Yo
Fuck a famous bitch then I treat her just like a ski-oh
Not even worth a shower, just grab me a stick of deo
Monday for ménages and Tuesday I get a trio
And the bitch that get a gift on the scriff, she was a PO
Pull up to the club, I got a kilo in the car
Black card but a nigga spendin' c-notes at the bar
I'm not a star
I'm not a star
I'm not a star
I'm not a starHoney, it's shameless
Shameless, what you've done
Welcome to the home of the brave 
Rozay ugh
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, I am shameless, what you've done
So self made
I can still count a mill' without a money machine nigga
Got on my darkest shades, this man is made
Inherit no riches, Jehovah's my witness
Physical fitness, home economics
In the kitchen digital scales producin' the product
Cut the noose off my neck, black runaway slave
In the coupe with the Tec, it's the home of the brave
They wanna know names, they totin' on thangs
Never wanted the fame, just wanted a Range
I needed some change, mama needed a raise
She stayed in a rage, hated minimum wage
I'm feelin' the same, all these criminals paid
Wearing Bally's and gold, I'm sellin' dope shameless to say
And maybe one day I could put this pain away
Until then I'mma be a d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be a d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, what you've done

Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, I am shameless, what you've done
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Before I was a fetus, had the genes of a leader
I mean look at my features, educated my teachers
I was callin' them plays, you were still in the bleaches
Boobie gave me the game, change to give me some sneakers
Now I'm roamin' the block, car missin' the top
Meanin' missin' a roof, hope you listenin' y'all
I was dealt a few blows, I felt a few lows
Even shed a few tears, I traveled that road
Went from walkin' on gravel, now I'm ridin' on vogues
50M's in the bank, I get me 200, I'm gone
Still so close to the hood, I'm ashamed to say
All the money in the world can't take this pain away
It's just another story at the campfire
Court side seats with the franchise
I think about my niggas doin' 25
Shinin' bright, who am I for you to criticize?
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, what you've done
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say

Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
I'm smokin' psychedelics, I hustle like a felon
Hottest record label, but still in all I'm chillin'
Not a crack in my voice, this young nigga so poised
First I stack some money, then go to war with them boys
Anybody can get it, hand his mammy some tissue
Better ring the alarm, cause we bringin' them pistols
Have them singin' them songs, speakin' on sensitive issues
These emotional niggas, and most of them killas
They movin' in silence, but they follow your Twitters
These the games that they play, they study your Instagram pictures
See I live by the code that the mafia wrote
When he ran his mouth, me I'd rather smoke
I'd rather listen, he had to ask permission
I had to make a way, I had to act commission
Until this day I'm slain, the commission remains
Net worth over a billion, I'm ashamed to say
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, what you've done
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Honey, it's shameless

We started off dead broke

Justice League
It's amazing to be alive when niggas wants you to die
Mad at every check you deposit, I see it all in their eyes
I'ma stunt harder, I'ma shop more
Black bell boy, Persian rugs at the door
Giving niggas jobs, living like the mob
A scotch in the soda anastasia.com
People talking 'bout me, say I got a body
Or are they mad at me that the house got a lobby?
Big four-fifths spliffs at the boat split
Tip toein' through the city, Alvin Ailey with a brick
Settin' new milestones, gettin' my style on
Down in Coconut Grove where niggas don't smile long
City full of barbarians, wet you like an aquarius
Only beautiful bitches, they tell me the more the merrier
Fascinatin' faces, now it's top jewelers
Pina colada daiquiris Fontaine Bleau on a Tuesday
Got the Desert Eagle up in Fred Segal
Only fat nigga in vintage Moschino
Attempted murder, I refuse to exile
So it's Club LIV til I'm exed out
A gold casket my final request
Bangin' at em like my child they want molest
Therefore I pray I live a hundred years
Be a crutch for my kids all through their wonder years
Oil money fuck up a hundred mill
That's just a yacht and a crib, nigga dying to live
Champagne, spillin' the opulence
Side bitches remain anonymous
Got a condo on Collins, another on Sunny Isle
Makin sure you get around cause these niggas will gun you down
Got my daughter a Fendi purse then I took her to Disney World
All I give her is game, digesting my every word
Tired and chartered a plane, oil money the game
Classics stay on my feet, Double M on my chain
All I think about is oil money
These niggas barely gettin' tour money
It's gonna be aight, it's gonna be aight - don't even worry 'bout nothing 
You know? Gon' talk that shit for a minute, put the dutch out, light a Cuban up
Dim the lights if you want , cause we already shinin' 
You know? , ha, HA-HAAAEEEH, yeah, uh...
Tryna get a grip, but you just can't clutch it
When the money is in the circle, the squares can't touch it 
Reaping the benefits from the years that we suffered
If they don't know nothin' else they know I'm not to be fucked with 
Chillin' on the deck, brainstorming on the check
You don't see the bigger picture, you just see the silhouette 
Keep your ho still 'fore I nail her
Money on my mind while I hold still for the tailor 
Three man weave, I dump it off to the trailer
If the pack too loud, dump it off with the sealer 
We pop bottles, have the shots of the tequila
Might see me in something you can't cop from the dealer 
Probably gon' rang, Gareth Pugh and Belstaff
Work coming in, I sit on some and sell half
Made it to the top overnight, that's why you fell fast
Best head I got in my life, for a Chanel bag 
This is heaven on earth shit, give me my hell pass 
Niggas tryna copy my style, but they don't sell swag
Nah, vacationing on in the Maldives
Room service come to you on a boat, child, please
Don't get me confused though, cause I'll squeeze
Niggas know I get huge dough and wild ki's
Uhh, I will forever cash in
Oil money mean the wealth's everlasting
What!
{M-M-M-Maybach Music}Being self made is all I know, 'til my dick in the dirt
One time for the real niggas 
Huh!
Big bank take little bank
Drop an X pill in the fish tank

Big bank take little bank
Drop an X pill in the fish tank

Watch, that four door gon' pull up
Watch, them hoes gon' pogo out
Cake my birthday, blow them candles
Baby please don't blow my high
It's a band-aid on your forehead, I got people on my knot
It keep bulging up out my pocket, said release me to the sky
This is big bank talk, bank vault frequent visitors
Swear that money keep a nigga shitten like the chili does
Ol' hot dog tater chip bag ass nigga
No shirt, no shoes, no swag ass nigga
Or get cash ass nigga, put that title by my name
Hottest lighters, I'm a fighter, plus that rifle got a aim
I just left the title game, don’t that trophy look so shiny?
And your ho keep tryna poke me, I'm surrounded by this diamonds
Okay then
Big bank take little bank
Drop an X pill in the fish tank
Got the sharks on lean
Fishscale for my whole team
I say Benji after Benjamin, pretty hoes I'm swimmin' in
If they ain't talkin' money, it's just fuck 'em like my women friend
Pull up in the Aston, sound so sexy when the engine rim
It goe "vroom, vroom, skrrt", that bitch cost like seven birds
Scrooge McDuck, 'bout seven worth, swimmin' in that money bitch
She say she don't like them broke, she in love with money dick
If money make her cum, I keep her busting like 100 clip
Marathon on that paper baby, I be running shit, hah!
Big bank take little bank
100 karat diamond chain make them hoes blink
30 shots'll make them fucking jack boys think
20,000 old money, y'all lil' Franks, bitch!
Big bank take little bank
Drop an X pill in the fish tank
Got the sharks on lean
Fishscale for my whole team
Money stuck on my mind, .40 tucked in my jeans
Dice game, tryna stop the bank
I lose, can a motherfucker lean? 
Big bank take little bank, two shakes in the middle with a ballpit
Your arm full, my sharks starvin'
And I'ma eat your motherfuckin food then
My hands dirty, my face clean
Self made, trying to stay up about to stay clean
Work that triple beam, papi call me fuego
Money low, break it down, 36, Eggo
Leg up, grind like I need my break switch
Four's on a boat, 28's on a spaceship
Straight fish, whip two to three racks on racks
Aaron Rodgers, I quarterback the pack
Big bank take little bank
Drop an X pill in the fish tank
Got the sharks on lean
Fishscale for my whole team
I fuck four bitches, I got eight balls
I'll finish your career, nigga: eight bars
Fly with that, got the streets, I die with that
Slept on me nigga, power nap, fifth of the Hen', the sour pack
Eight in that glitter and gold, bitch that's VS1
Bitch a hundred fifty, you niggas smelling fishy
We got pills up in that tank, mills up in that bank
You know I coach them niggas like Phil up in that paint
50 thou on that Rollie, 50 thou, bet on Kobe
6 feet 2 in the Maybach, 100 clip for the payback
100 grand in this motherfucker, gotta hold a 10 in this motherfucker
Coke Boy, I'ma get Japan in this motherfucker

Fake niggas always caught up in the realest shit
Mama always told me, "Watch who you be dealin' with"
Snake bitches, can't get wrapped up in your feelings with
Never watered down, my niggas on some killin' shit
Miami mercenaries, really, that's the double M
Born baller, baby boy, I be above the rim
Quick step, then I plant, just like I'm Durant
Peyton Manning with the poems, go look at the stats
Went from sleepin' on the floor to pissin' Moët
All my teachers sellin' dope, even sold me a sack
Wake up in the mornin', so I need to smoke
When I really need to keep my queen close
MAC-11, dirty money on my prayer rug
Say a prayer for me, really show a player love
Time to touch a million, did it with finesse
Never wait up for me, go and get your rest

Who I put in pain, who I put in work with
Always saying something me, when I be
Runnin', runnin', runnin' the streets
But would you still be fuckin' with me
If I was wearin' the same jeans for a week?
If I was hungry and I ain't have nothing to eat?
Would you, yeah, would you still think about it when you up?
Don't think about me when I'm gone
'Cause I ain't comin' home
And you'll be all alone
So think about it when you up

Runnin' the streets like a runny nose
Ain't no love in the streets when you bleedin' from a bullet hole
Like Stanley Yelnats, he caps, his head red
The feds' come across, lost, a man's dead
Dyslexic, spell Dade
Street sweeper clean up the streets like Cascade
They back on the rampage, like Quentin
Shippin' 'em off to San Quentin
Ran wicked with some niggas on the block
Still stickin' on the beam
Gentrification, junkies, and fiends
Workin' later, so I'm sendin' a message off to my queen
If I don't make it out alive, you and I
Is the only thing important to me, in case I die
Message received, she's a blessing indeed
Make sure I put something away for when she carry my seed
For my unborn son, I got a few words left
Be better than me, and everything, on my last dyin' breath, ah

Limo tints on my shades, skinnies on my blades
Crocodile kicks like my hood the Everglades
Rich forever paid
Do it with no effort, now lets effin' celebrate
Toast and spill the grapes, hoes catchin' vapes
Toe touchin' freaks
She jumped on my pole and did a pole trick for me
Slippin' on ya pimpin' that means more grip for me
Chrome lips on the Forgi's damn near swallowing the street
You owe me, homie have that now
I'mma pull that Gat out now
Must be out your rabid mind, I'm thuggin', rappin', same damn time
I rock Gucci, I rock Louie, at the same damn time

No finales 
Yeah, such a breath of fresh air
Get a blow job, have a seizure on a Lear
Or get a new car, I could lease it for a year
Or bring it back tomorrow, that's a lease that disappear
Count new money, peelin' out a venue
New Maybach after it was discontinued
Never question mine, my mind is so inventive
Quadrupled my net worth and threw in a few incentives
Maybach IV the allure that I adore
All money game, we got ones in the floor
See me on the wood, nigga, pause at the game
Two mil, the jewels, no flaws, ask them lames
Bow to the boss in the presence of a don
Started on the corner, nigga, didn't have a coin
Playin' my position for a club that I can join
Never in the draft, but that boy know he goin'
Throw me a bomb , get me a brick
That's on the Quran, I'mma go and get the chips
Go and get a rental , I got a cute bitch
She's showin' some potential, so we takin' trips 
Nigga, assets last while memories fade
I'mma patch that ass, I don't get paid
I'm a Mike Tyson typer, typewriter sniper
Double M life 'til a nigga pay the piper
I love when the beat dip
Same way I love to see a ki' flip
Go and pay your mama house off
Get sucked off, shawty wipe your mouth off
I'm alive, you could never write the South off
South paw, box a nigga off like a outlaw
Quick thinker, big better shut your mouth boy
Black chips, gold bottles, ship it out raw
Pullin' up slow, look at that boy
Young B.I.G., Lil Kim on tour
Lil Cease with me, all the cheese with me
All the G's with me, Maybach Eazy-E
The good times don't last long
Just rewind the last song 
We all shared some great times 
As I read some great rhymes 
What we does, is what dreams are made of
Come and get this love, all of this love, aye
500 for the car that I got on the strip
That's another 100, what I got on my wrist
800 for the jar that I'm about to twist
It's a female strand, you know life's a bitch
As I get high, move my curtains to the side
Age like fine wine, ambitions they never die
Niggas get abused like boys at Penn State
Greatest that ever did it, decided my own fate
Dreams, everything we are
The life that we're living, baby it's ours
Dreams, money, homes, and cars
Baby that's a given
I'm talking 'bout every fantasy
Be good real with me
So don't miss something move, ayy
Baby, come with me and live the dream
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League 
It's a whole 'nother different element
It's Maybach Roman numeral, four 
You couldn't fathom this, you couldn't imagine this
You can't produce this, you won't reproduce this
I'll be dreaming of you, yeah 
I'll be dreaming of you, yeah
You will make it come true, ooh 
I'll be dreaming of you 
I'll, I'll 
I'll be dreaming of you, yeah 
I'll be dreaming of you, yeah 
You will make it come true
Rozay! Huh 
I'll be dreaming of you
Yessir, this is LA Reid
You will make it come true 
It takes a boss to know a boss
I'll, I'll
It takes greatness to recognize greatness
Ricky Ross, the boss, Maybach IV"A little over a year ago I was in bondage, and now I'm back out here reaping the blessings and getting the benefits that go along with it, everything that's out here for kings like us. The reason why we like this, this jewelry and this diamonds and stuff, they don't understand is, because we really from Africa, and that's where all this stuff come from. And we originated from kings, you know what I'm saying? So don't look down on the youngsters because they wanna have shiny things. It's in our genes, know what I'm saying? We just don't all know our history, so peace to the Midwest. Keep it P-I, you know what I'm saying?"

"Come on let's pray: Dear Lord
Please forgive us for all the sins we have brought upon us
And look down upon us with forgiveness for all the sins we will have in the future
I know you understand that niggas ain't perfect, but we try, Lord
We try to keep our heads up in bad times
This is a bad time; show us the way
And if you can't show us the way
Then forgive us for being lost­I live just enough for the city so I get by
Money never changed how I felt, would I risk my
Life for a dollar, homie? Nah, I don't think so
Greed breeds jealous, niggas out here wantin' info's
Catch a nigga slippin', put a bullet in his temple
Homie, it's the same rules, money talks, simple
My kinfolk, call it what I'm livin' like the high life
Only if he knew what I had to do to keep my mind right
I, I tell you I got 20/20 hindsight
See it in the distance, hieroglyphics keep the rhymes tight
My mind like, game recognize that
Real recognize real, still .45 strapped
Underneath the white tee, Zimmerman get shot down
Hero, it ain't nothin' but a sandwich, call the cops now
Fuck the police, stop runnin'
White boys terrorize nigga' neighborhoods, gunnin'
Down the innocent, in the beginnin' it's:
"You was doin' 50 in the 35", the endin' is:
"You fit the description of the subject in this incident
We gon' have to take you downtown for some questionin'"
Damn, a blessin' in disguise if you ask me
I was just about to hit the highway with my last ki
Could it be that maybe God has intervened?
Spared my life like he did so many times in between?
A half a block away from the crime scene
A minute earlier and that was me, think
I've been knowin' Ross since he was Teflon
Same nigga now as back then, nothin' stepped on
Dopeman, dopeman yellin'
Cook it 'til it's rock hard, bag it up, sell it
Aroma so loud, so loud that you can smell it
Death to them niggas gettin' caught go and tellin'
And every time I turn around, y'all got somethin' to say about me
But y'all don't know a damn thing about me
Just what you see, that's what you judge me on
Every time I turn around, the guilty be pointin' fingers at me
Homie, I'm just tryna be all I can be
But not for free, that's what the fuck be wrong
I need that
Damn, can't even believe this day here, my nigga
I remember us sittin' in the parkin' lot talkin' about gettin' money
Cracks in the wall, standin' in the puddle
Sunny south Florida, a cold motherfucker
Ready for a war, barely wanna talk
Ballys on my nigga as they walkin' back and forth
Makes you wanna hustle, take care of my brothers
Raymond passed away, here's somethin' for his mother
It never is enough, tryna show her that I love him
We were fishin' buddies, breed the dog, split the puppies
Pictures on the wall, bitches we done raw
Niggas gettin' robbed, the only shit that we can solve
We all wanna get it, ball for a minute
Accept collect calls, tell our dawgs that we did it
Plenty money orders, that what uncle Kenny taught us
Keep your face clean when you're out here bendin' corners
Always keep in mind you'll fall in love a thousand times
Regardless what we went through, I'm still right here by your side
Artificial homies, worse than the agents
When you parkin' all your cars, they wanna know the payments
Rose petals drippin' on the casket
Baby boy done grew into a bastard
On that lean, you know I fuck her fantastic
Work white as Rita Ora in that plastic
Took shots, shed tears, that's war
Bust bottles on yachts, stand tall
Catch a case, don't talk, that's raw
Scarface, Rick Ross, big boys
Big boys
Scarface, Rozay, we big boys
And every time I turn around, y'all got somethin' to say about me
But y'all don't know a damn thing about me
Just what you see, that's what you judge me on
Every time I turn around, the guilty be pointin' fingers at me
Homie, I'm just tryna be all I can be
But not for free, that's what the fuck be wrong
I need that
I need that 
I need that 
I need that bag Rather You Than Me
If you've been fucking with me from Port of Miami
It's been hell of a fucking journey
 Ain't nothin' changed, nigga
Lil' stronger, lil' wiser, maybe a lil' more violent
Blame it on America, fuck it 
Huh!
I'm pullin' off the lot, I bought it cash 
Her future bright, don't give a fuck about her past 
Her ass be lookin' good inside the leggings 
But I notice that she missin' all her edges 
I run the game just by runnin' with the felons 
Poor attitude and got rich nigga calisthenics 
Walkin' in the courtroom sippin' on a beverage 
I know the judge so I got a lot of leverage 
Pissin' on these bitches is a fetish 
Fully loaded .60s smokin' on a seven

Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a nigga

Stackin' bricks to the sky, this is it, haaaan
When my dogs gettin' high gettin' rich, haaaan
And a nigga rich, haaaan
Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a nigga
Pull a pistol, bang on a nigga
Beamer on the Boulevard, everybody know it's me
Bordeaux Polo, smoke a ton of weed
No room for nonsense, you under new ownership
Pullin' niggas' cards, givin' shooters bonuses
Fuck the rumors, now I'm standin' in a room with ya
Face, gut, buck 50, got two pistols
We the Knights of the Templar
Born dopeboy, oh, I should've been stopped
Def Jam see me as a threat now
Hundred mill, any less is a let down
This is it, boy
Stackin' money to the sky, gettin' rich, haaaan
Stackin' bricks to the sky, this is it, haaaan
When my dogs gettin' high gettin' rich, haaaan
And a nigga rich, haaaan
Full magazine, bitch, shoot for the stars
Snatch a nigga chain just to post it on the blog
Assassinate a name, nigga sprayin' in the dark
Hate you with a passion, but he askin' for a job
Shame on a nigga that tried to run game on a nigga
Pull a pistol, bang on a nigga
Gettin' money while them other boys bitter
I'm an artist and my niggas are the realest
What a shame pussy niggas wear glitter
Put to sleep by the pillowcase killer
Black Benz, black weed, black bottle, nigga
Rich, dirty niggas still mobbin', nigga

And a nigga rich, haaaanHello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet, to go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Renzel, aka Ricky Rubin
I miss you kissin' my lips, consoling my confidence
Apologies from the heart is something that’s heaven sent
Scars for the flesh, war wounds for the soul
Success is another test and we wanted the highest score
Mother did her job, fundmental love
But it never was enough cause I wanna be a thug
Tears fall all the way to the south of France
Poverty line hang lower than my pants
Invited to the Grammy's but I feel so out of place
After we washed plates and they was always out of steak
That is a sin, I was built to win
Came to win the title, Rozay wavin' in the stands
Academics was a myth, I can always plead the fifth
Or give it to you live, Beethoven on the Fifth
Your favorite films tank, Titanic sank
Aroma of the dank as I'm breathin' through the bank
Black market open for business from the poors to the riches
From the poors to the riches
From the poors to the riches
From the poors to the riches
Ricky Ross
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Anymore
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymoreM-M-M-M-Maybach Music
Girl I think you're special
Strictly presidential , yeah
You know the crib on the water now
The Maybach stay watered down
Project niggas givin' orders now
The gold Presidential just to sport around
I'm from the era of fitted caps and rental cars
Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads
Walkin' on Jewish marble, hand painted the ceilin'
Happy Hanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feelin'
Got my seats on the wood, playas givin' me dap
Lyor like how I move, Warner right in my lap
I made a few mils, ain't mentionin' Meek
Went and bought a new crib, week of Wale release
Bitches, the king comin', Billie Jean thumpin'
I need to hear the trumpets, meanin' machine gunnin'
I ain't missin' nothin', got her sippin' somethin'
I could ship her somethin', you know that December comin'
Girls and green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's  who we are, baby 
All I ever need is girls and green 
Ugh, may see me leanin' in some new shit
Now it's gold Presidentials for the crew shit
Threesomes, weed crumbs on the cruise ship
I'm a boss have you ass on a news clip
She a dime but she gotta be a cool bitch
Pony tail, red nails, still in school bitch
Needed some cash so she asked me could she move shit
Not a chance, whips got her talkin' foolish
I was skippin' the classes, but I got me a master
I was gifted at math, always counted the fastest
Fishscale made me major profit margins
I'm a prophet stuffin' my pockets, you niggas starvin'
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm with this pretty bitch
80 grand, rubber band for some silly shit
She on that Alexander Wang
Gold Presidential VS when I change the game
Girls and green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's  who we are, baby 
All I ever need is girls and green 
Ugh, she wanna roll with a winner now
So I let her roll with the windows down
My nigga's up the road come and get it now
60-40 no we split it up the middle now
Shawty's said the word, I was talkin' that talk
Maybe link up New York, that's awesome as fuck
I never been in love until I heard a beat
She never met a G until she heard of me
3rd floor projects, feel my point of view
Everything is number 2, that's when it come to you
Isabel Marant sneakers 'til the summer through
Fuck you on a yacht is what I wanna do
Ugh! Baby girl got that wet wet
I repeat: wet wet
I'm the boss and I'm on that
 white tee, gold Rolex
Girls and green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's  who we are, baby 
All I ever need is girls and green 
Her shoe game remarkable
I feel solely responsible
I feel solely responsible 
I feel solely responsible, oh oh"The Lord as my witness
Lord as my witness, there's not!
There's not a better MC than Rick motherfuckin' Ross
Lord as my witness
And when a nigga says "Lord as my witness", a nigga tellin' the truth
You don't lie after you say Lord as my witness
Did you ever hear OJ say "Lord as my witness?"
No, he ain't go that far, said "I didn't do it"
He hired Johnnie Cochran but he ain't never say 'Lord as my witness.'"
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Went to war, beaker scores, they continue to fall
Corner stores, wait up, hold all these wonderful laws
So much violence in the streets, ask the powers that be
Kiss my daughter on the cheek and I'm strapped as we speak
Dirty money get bloody, you still see the gun wounds
But what's funny are the ones that we put the guns to
Fuck 'em all, kill or be killed, it's still a thug rule
Back of class, high on grass, 'til I said, "Fuck school!"
What's meant to be is meant to be, I rather you than me
Die with pride, forty shells on the murder scene
Rolls Royce, leather stitchin' in the steerin' wheel
Ninth album, Ice Cube, nigga, kill at will
Had to balance, Double M is the imperial
Niggas pay respect, they mail it in an envelope
Fuckin' centerfolds like I still be dealin' dope
Probably would if you're talkin' like fifty or more
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
So creative, co-creator, family the motivator
Project buildings, lot of feelin', karma my codefendant
Pot to piss in, not a ribbon, never forgot a Christmas
Father figure not around, that's such a major difference
I would play with all my homies' gifts
I understood I didn't wanna trip
The lack of didn't tap my confidence
Matter fact that's how I mastered a couple things
Went from not havin', to sheer opulence
Maybach with the drapes like an apartment in it
Whole hood know it, only one that's white on white
Name ringin' like DJ Clue on a Friday night
Just got some real estate out in Dubai
Nation of Islam, they say I might have a few ties
Talkin' tall brothers with the dark shades
Shed light, bringin' niggas out the dark age
Sittin' in the court with a sharp fade
Havin' sentimental thoughts 'bout this Caucasian
Six million in the hole, still feelin' short-changed
Reprimanded by someone who's snortin' cocaine
Fred Hampton was an angel, may his name ring
Crackers wanna kill me for the same thing
Ain't no financial aid out in Notre Dame
Activist sippin' Actavis, time to pour away
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
You know how it is, new levels, new devils
The cheddar breed jealousy at hella speed but it's whatever
Mercedes driver, 85'er, enlightener, collapsable sun visor
The half moon identifies, the son of God, son of man
Son of Sam, young with the blam
Stick or get stuck, get killed to get buck, a blessin' of luck
I love all, test me, trust not
Above all but young niggas address me as such
Like Hannibal Barca, runnin' through Carthage
Panama watches, conquer the nonsense, conquerin' lion
Amun-Ra sun god combined in one, most prolific
You off point like the coke addicted lawyer, Klienfeldt's gun
Tell the waiter bring over that Moscow Mule
Tell them haters get over it, Nas still rules
To money makers and niggas who murk you out
And beat the death penalty on reversal trial, niggas versatile
Some things your eyes won't see 
But when it's out of your control 
Then it's the powers that be, be 
He he he he he, la la la la la la 
He he he he he, la la la la la la 
Some things your eyes can't see
But when it's out of your control
Then it's the powers that be, be

Every superwoman needs a superman, here I am
Sight seein', we might be in
The quattroporte or the new white BM
Home from FAMU with a gorgeous face
Next semester, she transfer to Florida State
Cookin' like Home EC for financial aid
I helped her out, she had problems with financial aid
Remember? Mean time our finance is straight
I even up the doors to the financial estates 
She use to fight with her mom
'Til I sat 'em both down, now she tight with her moms
Yeah, I put the ice on her arm
Now she know she gettin' sliced, spendin' nights in Milan
We still blow weed together
Cheated on her but we still gon' be together
Put the house on the water, hit the beach whenever
She from the north and still can't believe the weather
I gotta bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her
Now she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right, he ain't actin' right
Every superwoman needs a superman, here I am
Here I am, here I go
Why you lookin' for the others when you got the best?
The previous was a test for ya, now ya in the big league
A black Steinbrenner, who wouldn't wanna play for me?
Ya last man was a chump and you can tell 'em I said it
He was talkin' loud at first but you can see that he didn't
You can see I ain't sweatin'
Hell I'll call him up myself and tell him how he can get it
Naw, please don't confuse me miss
I'm tryna see how I can put you on my Christmas list
I hope you ain't offended by this
But I think ya ass fine as shit
And that's straight up real talk, all bullshit aside
She replied, "I, like to do the wild thing"
Actions took place, at my place
Now my place is her place
I gotta bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her
Now she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right, he ain't actin' right

More better, more cheddar
Knocked ya man off the clothes line sweater
Hoe getter, gorilla
Fuck chauffeurs, I went and got more killas
I rock with niggas like Fabolous
Cause to tell the truth, life fabulous
But you make it look glamorous
Cause them strapped heels aren't for amateurs
Wrist quite rocky, talk like Foxy
Job like Roxy, spark that broccoli
Walk like Aki, that means sexy
I will save you, if you let me
Fly with me, get high as me
A lot of alphabets girl I'm a G
Time will tell, Rolex watches
We show stoppers, hoes just watch us
I gotta bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her
Now she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right, he ain't actin' right
Every superwoman needs a superman, here I amPush it to the limit
Port of Miami , I'm importin' the candy 
Ain't got nothin' to lose, we supportin' the family
Never traffic for fun, only traffic for funds
All I seen is the struggle, it's like I'm trapped in the slums
Workers were barely paid, no water, we barely bathe
There better be better days on the way that's on my daddy grave
I'm pushin' it hard, I'm pushin' it soft
If he pushin' a line, he pushin' for Ross
I waited and waited, I done ran out of patience
They hated and hated, left him slow dancin' with Satan
Fresh in my white tee, Mac-11, swear to God
I bought my first block, broke it down and tore the block apart
I push and I push, I ride and I ride
Tryna survive on 95
Put it all on the line every drop of a dime
I be pushin' them whips, yep, three at time
I'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta 
II'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta 
I handle dope like a vandal off the banana boat
Bananas in our rifles, no cyphers, I'm just the man to know
I paid dues, my moves done made news
I'm smooth, my suede shoes they new like Ray shoes
Nobody used to speak, now e'rybody wave
You duck your momma house, you set your sister straight
I'm buildin' a dream, with elevators in it
Tailor made the linen, no gators got on my hater-vision
I see ya, I see ya suckers, I see ya clear
I know you see me in that Phantom whiter than veneers
Allergic to broke, determined to blow
On the boat we hid the work in detergent and soap
We ship it from Haiti, baby I'm whippin' them babies
Let it dry, let it dry, try to whip a Mercedes
Arrangin' my Range, here to rain ya parade

We started minute, the money matured
My money's secured, I got bundles in Europe
My bubble be pure, it cost like a hundred a pull
The world is yours, hundred million or more
Now I run the streets, they all mine
12 years overdue, call it due time
I told you never roll on the soul of a soldier
You never know that dishwasher may be the beholder
Whoever thought that fat girl would grow into Oprah
Or that boy Rick Ross would be moldin' the culture
I push and push, we breakin' the mold
We push and we push, we rake in the hold
I push and I push, I ride and I ride

Hopped out the Magnum, hopped in the Tre'
Just to let the top back and thank God for the day
Who gives a fuck what a hater gotta say?

Still in the streets, strapped with them thangs

So when my nigga Meek caught his case, I went to visit him
I'm walking up to the jail, all the niggas start repping
Beating on glass, kicking the doors, and shit
So when I walk through the door
The captain tell me, "You can't come in here"
Okay, cool
Came back two weeks later, I got access
Soon as I got on the cell block
I heard him all the way from down the hallway
My nigga had on yellow Balenciagas, ha ha ha ha
Started off poor with plans to own more
To ridin' under stars, the life we lived for
Dreamin' of things we can't afford
But now we comin' up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh
They gon' love me, they gon' love me now
I bet they tell they friends they wanna fuck me now, yeah
I bet they say, "He put his niggas on"
Now we comin' up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh
Corners wanna check him like Odell Beckham
I could plan a record or just draw the weapon
She know I'm livin' reckless lookin' at my necklace
I'ma blow this .40 on me, you can save the lectures
Homicides rise as the sun falls
Watch your dog die as my gun bark
These helicopters rise for the one in charge
If I sentence you to die, well that's a hundred shots
Judge bangin' like a blood, show a nigga love
Caught him with a kilo so he hit him with a dub
We bulletproof the trucks like the ones in Iraq
Where I'm at, you lock your door and you usin' a latch
Now it's stones on my hands, Roberto Durans
Stood tall in the feds, don't fold on the fam
Tryna point me to the money, no holdin' my hand
Somebody take me to the bank 'cause it open at ten
Yeah, uh
Poverty stricken, boy, you gotta be kiddin'
Livin' like we hit the lottery, nigga
I been tippin' since Scottie was Pippen, Chad was sippin'
And before I had that bag, I used to bag them bitches
I'm so cocky and I'm confident, all these killers in my ambiance
Say what I want, nobody's stopin' it
Get off my dick, nigga
Where you was at when I could've died for this?
Or die for that? Real nigga, roger that
Said I took a loss but I got it back, woo
Me and all my dogs sell a lot of that food
Talkin' to the law, knowin' that it's not cool
Make me shoot a rapper like my name was Benny Boom
Started out with nothin', now a nigga in a room
Sweepin' rich bitches off they feet like a broom
Double-M G, bitch, you know how we move
Whole lot of choppers, nigga, I could never lose
I was amazed
Oh how it turned their heads
I mastered the game
Oh how they raised their hands
Like Lamborghini doors
We, we're going up
We, we're going up
We, we're going up, oh so high
Like Lamborghini doors
We, we're going up
We, we're going up 
We, we're going up, oh so high
Like Lamborghini doors 
Uh, paintings on the wall, you never know the cost
You bangin' on the boss, the boy'll be a corpse
I'm steppin' through the door, my back against the wall
My pockets fat enough to catch a nigga if I fall
Love to see a pretty bitch rollin' a wood leaf
Phone ringin', smilin' like I got some gold teeth
I caught a bird, jet smarter on the Maltese
I left a chick out in DC out on the NorthEast 
Such a feelin', niggas killin' for my poetry 
Tryna go back underground, that's once they notice me 
I'm really not the one you wanna handle funny 
At the Grammys, my lil' homie had the hammer on him
You niggas out of style with your weddin' vows
I still be makin' rounds like I'm Kevin Liles 
Time to set a date for trial, we never settle out 
Them Lamborghini doors, you see me steppin' out
Started off poor with plans to own more
To ridin' under stars, the life we lived for
Dreamin' of things we can't afford
But now we comin' up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh
They gon' love me, they gon' love me now

Nigga, long as you livin' how you wanna live
Niggas gon' talk about you and that's completely fine with me
Niggas only salute niggas that's dead, and niggas in prison
 I wanna ball though, whoop! 
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a yacht, I keep me a knot
Still sippin' that syrup, might front you a block
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a Benz, just bought me a Rolls
I pay for that pussy, I go shopping for hoes
I got a house on my neck, my Panamera my pet
We bought ringside seats and got a brick I can bet
Money, power, respect, I took your bitch with finesse
Chickens jumping like checkers, but this game is chess
What's at stake is your freedom, niggas paying the price
When the judge drop the mallet, all he said was life
Nigga damn near fainted, barely stare at your wife
Brother took all your clothes, whip, sneakers, and ice
Got me holding my nuts, while I'm rolling the dice
760 new Beamer, got me rolling in white
Very few that you trust, better keep in your sight
Thinking I'm doing wrong, when these niggas ain't right
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a yacht, I keep me a knot
Still sippin' that syrup, might front you a block
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a Benz, just bought me a Rolls
I pay for that pussy, I go shopping for hoes
I just scooped me a BM and bought me a Rolls
When I pulled up on niggas, I swear they thought I was Hov
All my mixtapes platinum, niggas thought I was gold
I heard them suckas was hatin', I'm fucking all of they hoes
So I don't blame 'em, no I don't knock 'em
But if they play my dogs, we slay 'em, I'm talkin' pop 'em
Want some attention, hall-of-fame 'em, they talkin' bout us
Acting like bitches 'til we spray 'em, get the coffin out ya
We all about it, ahh! I'm ballin' till my very last breath
I hustle like I'm on my last check
And I ain't even in my bag yet
I wake up in the morning, where the cash at, go!
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a yacht, I keep me a knot
Still sippin' that syrup, might front you a block
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a Benz, just bought me a Rolls
I pay for that pussy, I go shopping for hoes
All I see is this money, never hate with your niggas
Better pray to your maker, before you war with the sinner
Ask forgiveness for mine, so I know that I'm good
All them niggas we robbed, trips T-Man took
Talkin' panhandle pimpin, niggas Chevy was lemon
Nigga dressing in linen, bases loaded first inning
Taking over the checks, relocating the tenants
Pulling open your vest, motivation is spinach
I gotta handle my business, I pay my mortgages first
When you cross a super-soaker, I bet your water get burst
Ain't no love on this side, just jealous niggas who ride
Until the day that you die, just hold your head to the sky
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a yacht, I keep me a knot
Still sippin' that syrup, might front you a block
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a Benz, just bought me a Rolls
I pay for that pussy, I go shopping for hoes
Ballin' til my last breath
Uptown, flashy life with my Smith & Wess
Hallways, choppa boys everyday
Spend your Benz, full of hundred B's in your face
My lil nephew was a born killa
Real nigga on the field, killa kill nigga
'Til I showed him how to cook a bird
Killa nigga nigga only if I finna work
Matches up in every town
Puttin' it down, hold it down for my fuckin' rounds
All day gunplay
Everyday rocked out nigga in every way
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a yacht, I keep me a knot
Still sippin' that syrup, might front you a block

Surviving R. Kelly, registered pedophiles 
Tried to feed all my niggas and spread the cheddar 'round 
Got a castle in Cali where I quote the Qu'ran 
It's a mansion full of gods 'til I pass the baton
I bow my head  you know what's next 
I say my prayers  hands across my chest 
Breaking shackles, I'm that nigga disobeying his master 
Paper chasing, standing still is a fuckin' disaster 
Emmett Till  cement shoes 
Can I live? My momma rent due 
Penal systems come to the Source, Benzino of C-notes

All my niggas really do it big time 
Lil' niggas, but we do it big time 
Started with a nickel rock now I'm big time

Big time, real nigga, big time 
I don't give a fuck, bitch 'cause I'm big time 
Til the day I die, I swear to God I'm big time
Amen 
I pray somebody tell you 'bout these bumpy roads 
Only maps to follow is your bible quotes 
And all them things your grandmother and father spoke 
I watch your actions not just captions in the shit you post 
Cappin' on niggas, that shit'll get you smoked 
But if you rap a lil' different, that shit'll get you more 
Just like baggin' them nickels up and down different coasts 
I be stackin' them tickets, I'm tryna sit with Hov' 
I be stackin' my tickets, I'm tryna sit with Hov' 
I was washing the dishes but now I get to toast 
I'm the talk of the bitches while they sippin' mimosas 
We could gossip 'bout the digits, discuss a few numbers 
Too many losses inside the trenches, don't let this become us 
Big time  God damn
I just got a crib in Chile to chill a few summers 
Or catch me out in Haiti, still running up numbers 
If I look into your eyes then I made you a promise

Broken memories
You will find a way
Rule number one is you can never rat
Fucking with you suckers set a nigga back
Break 'em down to baby sacks of Similac
And the only things on tracks I'm serving is the facts
Wanna pop the chain, kill you for your charm
Never mind your name, call you Uncle Tom
Shoot in front of bitches, never made a difference
'Cause impressing all the pigeons was the biggest interest
Quick to get it popping, nothing for your pockets
Crack melt like Baskin Robbins, never break a promise
Cops rushing doors, niggas flushing dope
Who really tipping Crime Stoppers? You would never know
Half my team illiterate, I know it sound pathetic
But we can each get a brick that's on a line of credit
Lot of niggas died over fake pieces
And the day I go, I pray my son, he get to read this
Broken memories always fade
Live on and you will find a way
Things will be okay, don't be afraid
Live on and you will find a way 
Uh, I only remember nights that was post-traumatic
So I'm never actin' bougie like I was supposed to have it
Serving addicts, toting ladders, it was so dramatic
Putting friends before my family my worsest habit
'Cause in my hood, it ain't no friends when you get the Benz
'Cause homie in the backseat wanna split your wig
Just to play the driver seat and say he hit a lick
And he gon' post it on the 'Gram like, "Don't forget the vid'"
Seen niggas tell on their own homies just to get to LIV
Miami on a Sunday just to commit them sins
And these the ones we supposed to ride for, forget the kids
Throw your life away for a nigga that wouldn't send your kids
Twenty dollars when you in your bid, this the way we live, the way we did
'Cause I'm in the chains, fuck the way it is
The way it was, now the only way is up
I'm never into faking love, I'm only here to wake you up
Young nigga
Broken memories always fade
Live on and you will find a way
Things will be okay, don't be afraid
Live on and you will find a way
In a 911, came without a ceiling
Can't imagine all the pain your brother was concealing
When we order fully loaded 'cause it's so appealing
Sue you and then do you for a couple million
Started from the bottom, rip the carpet up
Parents great examples 'cause they never argue much
Air conditioner in the window, watch the water drip
Premonitions of my death is what I wanna miss
Pretty pictures of my kids the only ones I kiss 
When you get a second chance, young brother, what a gift 
New obituaries everywhere I look
Praying every hour God keep me on His books 
Cemeteries, we pull up on 'em in foreign cars 
Extended payments elated, now met with open arms 
Look at all these rappers wearing bogus charms 
When they barely pay for marijuana in cigars
Broken memories always fade
Live on and you will find a way
Things will be okay, don't be afraid
Live on and you will find a wayHottest niggas in the game

Used to call me dyslexic it was a challenge to read
Mother held me at night until I finally achieved
Sometimes I look in the mirror I can't believe I'm alive
Disrespectful to niggas who wanna take me alive
Wishing death on you niggas we never see eye to eye
Some how I pray for you niggas at the very same time
See I was raised in the South, you helped your brother to shine
I watched everything change in a blink of an eye
Rappers wanna be ballers, ballers wanna be rappers
When the liquor endorsements worth more than your masters

We gotta reach what we can't reach
Tryna shine when the sun won't
I gotta grind as I gun toke
She's rollin' weed as I'm doin' me
I kept the G's, she can count on me
Wonderful times, lay a head for a young nigga
Like the day she told her dad I was a drug dealer
That explains how the cars came
And all the big money at the card games

Timb boots and the coat nice
New Porsche with the smoke lights

Oh, glidin' through the city to my place 
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space 
Oh, you can find me in my Maybach
Listening to shit from way back 
Oh, ah, Maybach Music 
Flows mind-blowing, these niggas switching the topic
All dick-riders, your label labeled erotic
You got a couple dollars, but really, it's barely modest
Couldn't sign me if you niggas was payin' homage
Playin' both sides, convicted you with verdict
Pay a lil' rider, come hit you up for the murder
Chains all hollow, I peeped soon as I heard it
These niggas be talkin' shooter, but quick to send they attorney
Is it really real, like Candy Lady allure?
Money overboard, kilos washin' ashore
Paintings on the wall, Versace down to the drawers
Currency come in Crypto, you know they tapin' our calls
Chariots and lofts, niggas legs crossed
Talkin' long money, but they conversation's short
New accolades with women for me to toss
They call it "the road to riches", regardless, I had to walk
Now it's too many cars, they say I live in a bubble
But I make it the point, we poppin' all through the Summer
Got pilots and gunners, receivers, passers and punters
My pockets playin' for keeps, G's get more than what's common
I made a few mistakes, I pray I get to repent
The passion came from the pain, I'm paintin' you all my sins
Warhol, Art Basel how it's so soft
More raw 'til Hov cut the 'fro off
Glidin' through the city to my place 
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space 
Oh, you can find me in my Maybach
Listening to shit from way back 
Oh, ah, Maybach Music
Let's go for a ride to where your heart desire
I put your heart in drive, I'll let you borrow mine
My feet on top the clouds, I walk a thousand miles
She got them soft pussy lips, call it cotton mouth
And I'm on autopilot, got a larger closet
I'm at target practice, you at Target shoppin'
Second hand smoke got her vision partly cloudy
Her eyes get so watery, them bitches started drownin'
On the ride of a lifetime
Watch out for the rats, mice, cons and the pythons
No Triple H, my God, I'm so sky high
Comin' down from the night sky, like a lightening rod
Shine like some ice, nice vibes, like a kite flyin'
No strings attached, we replace it with a lifeline
Out of body feelin', out our clothes and our right minds
Baby, ride me like a bumpy road to the high rise, yeah, yeah
Glidin' through the city to my place 
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space 
Oh, you can find me in my Maybach
Listening to shit from way back 
Oh, ah, Maybach Music
Glidin' through the city to my place 
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space

Her pussy deep as my voice, my Cuban links heavy
I just bought out the bar, got these bitches so thirst
Entertainment for women, my niggas ride for a verse
I'm hustling global, I stunt like a champ
All these boy scouts soldiers, fuck you and your camp
Got on all of my jewels, don't fall for the trap
I got one of my fools, he don't listen to rap
But he listen to me, so listen to me
When you listen to me, I get you this in a week
Put a hater to sleep, the sky’s the limit
I got R. Kelly money, when Fiesta was winning
I got my back to the wall, can I handle my business?
And I'm ready for war, niggas killing for pennies
See my focus was M's, my chances were slim
Counting multiple millions, we should get this on film
When you lean on the state, then you label the rat
On my feet so long, I won't fuck on my back 
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
These haters can't hold me back
No!
These niggas want to hold me back, these hoes want to hold me down
Jail cells want to hold me in, my bond paid who finna hold me now?
I'm tap toes on my square, 'til they flip the switch on my chair
These niggas be fake as fuck, but this official right here
Black Cadillac, scrap back could handle that
Baka fa fly fly, till that barrel melt like candle wax
Drop a sack: Geronimo, I ain't counting; gotta go
Everywhere that dollar go, put more gold on my collar bone
You say you're thuggin', you say you're real
You say you're gangsta', so call
Slide up with that oak out, everybody like "Oh God!"
Cut the deck, deal it out, bet I'll pull your ho card
Shit real, oh yah, thought it was a joke, huh?
These dummies can't hold me back, these hoes can't hold me back
3 banks can't hold these stacks, pin them hoes like goldie mack
Smoke till I vanish, I got rich like I planned it
If there's a price on your head, on your roof, choppers we land it
I used to play on that block, dark liquor and candles
Now you look in my lot, rose Ferraris and Lambos
Talkin South Bronx: Al Qaeda, Rozay, Meek Mill, Wale
Blow mills like a ball player, Magic to Bird, Isiah
Shorty trying to kick it, looking for that meal ticket
Diamonds splashin' goin flip it, on that Juicy J they trippin'
I done came up off lick? boy, got you on a list, boy
Your life on my wrist, boy, niggas need a fix, boy
These niggas trying to hold me back, these niggas trying to bake me in
These niggas ain't putting in work, these niggas gotta hate to win
Us niggas don't play no games, my niggas gonna shoot them thangs

My cousin fighting a case, I hope he beat it like eggs
You niggas thinkin' you fly, that flight delayed
And then I look at my bitch, I tell her wake up
She sleep butt naked, I sleep in my truks

Between her legs, five star restaurant

On the phone Farrakhan gave me my first Quran
We joined hands, said a prayer, may Allah bless the don

Maybach Music
I like this Maybach Music
"Push it to the-"
"Everyday I'm-"
"Ten years later-for me to cash out"
"Chickens put me in position"
"At the top"
Now there is something you need to know about the mastermind
In order to understand the overall concept and the prior to achieve success in all that you do
You must know that you can borrow other people knowledges, achievements, life experiences, and even their personal ressources in order to execute your own life goals
By adapting this one idea, you can achieve more in a short time than you could in a lifetime otherwise
“I stand boss and I mean that”
We all know that you cannot get something for nothing
There is a price tag to everything
Even your own successMaybach Music
You think you're using me
Like this game's new to me
But you ain't confusing me
You just want jewelry
Another fuckin shopping spree
But that ain't stopping me
And I ain't stopping you
See we’ll be cool as long as you
Just play your part
Just play your part
Just play your part
We’ll be cool as long as you just play your part
I’m inclined with women who come on they time
She came over and she came a few times
From crispy futons to Christian Louboutin
Game over, had her shopping in Milan
Twenty racks, really that's sneaker money
Triple white Ferrari, yeah that's the Easter Bunny
At the Caesar in Vegas, yeah I put the Visa on it
Now all she do is tell me how she used to love me
I let her decorate the real estate
And I let her spend a half a ticket, give or take
A couple dollars, Harry Winston stone collars
Canary yellow everything, plane chartered
I spoiled her maybe cause I adored her
More than fly, that girl's a flying saucer
My Mona Lisa painting on the wall came to life
And she said to love a bitch is to roll the dice
You think you're using me
Like this game's new to me
But you ain't confusing me
You just want jewelry
Another fuckin shopping spree
But that ain't stopping me
And I ain't stopping you
See we’ll be cool as long as you
Just play your part
Just play your part
Just play your part
We’ll be cool as long as you just play your part
Uh, I try to love 'em in the physical, not literal
She said she love me but what I’m feeling is minuscule
I understand that Prada lives in her inner sole
So the devil that droves in her got her control
Anne Hathaway and sack chasing, getting yacht cake up
Though my paper way thicker than model make-up
But y'all wait up, my mind racing, I'm cold slipping
A lot of women is real, some bitches Robin Given
I never give ‘em no liquid, no pot to piss in
I tend to leave them quite offended if they too dependent
I’m pitchin bitches that's dreaming, thinking I'm trickin’ chicken
I’m simply fuckin’ with bitches that know they whole position
That's real nigga shit, real nigga life
I give my heart to one broad, the others get the pipe
I ain't tryna fight, I ain't tryna fuss
I'm tryna follow money, she tryna fall in love
You think you're using me
Like this game's new to me
But you ain't confusing me
You just want jewelry
Another fuckin shopping spree
But that ain't stopping me
And I ain't stopping you
See we’ll be cool as long as you
Just play your part
Just play your part
Just play your part
We’ll be cool as long as you just play your part
Yo, I say, how can they compare to you? Everything material
Trickin’ shit for kids and you know I don't need no cereal
You know I was ridin’ and you switched up like a gear or two
So all that other shit you on dead, burial
Funeral, check my phone, reacting like it's new to you
Talking what I give but never speak on what I do for you
Cabo to Jamaica every weekend, honeymoonin' you
Lobster over salmon and I ain't ever tried to tuna you
But now I'm just assuming you, living off of hearsay
Treble like the radio cause everything was airplay
First class Hermes, Panamera, purp pass
Greed written on her face, when I bought her first bag
And I ain't really give a fuck, it was like a nigga rushed
Told my jeweler make her freeze like I was tryna stick her up
She call me daddy like a nigga Puff
Just play your role and we can live it up
You think you're using me
Like this game's new to me
But you ain't confusing me
You just want jewelry
Another fuckin shopping spree
But that ain't stopping me
And I ain't stopping you
See we’ll be cool as long as you
Just play your part
Just play your part
Just play your part
We’ll be cool as long as you just play your part

'Specially if you paid a couple payments on her mamma crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man, I hate those kids
Last birthday, she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her, "Do better"
She said, "How 'bout I get you jewelry from the West End?"
How 'bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend?
I'm jokin', I'm just serious, I asked her

You deserve a coupe todayYeah! Maybach Music! Family we livin'
Who stack cheddar better than the rat killer
That nigga that bust gats quicker, and he throw back liquor
The mafia way, toast it up like Sopranos
And when it's snowin, I push it like pianos
Back in the Lambo like I was born with it
Makavelli prophecy shoot up the car I'm goin' with it
From the cradle to the grave on these twenty two's
Before I take my last breath I let the semi loose
If there's heaven for a nigga with a crucifix
So much ice in it, mix the O and Gin and Goose with this
B-O- double S that's my nigga Ross!
And I'm his Cali connect, cause I can get it 'cross
Used to put ducks in the bathroom watch that bitch float
Couple years past now it's keys on the big boat
Take a shortcut 'round the Pacific
Throw the AK in Atlantic that's mafia livin'
Guess who's bizack? Yeah, nigga you guessed
Who shot ya, I spit murder, the music is mafia
The swag's incomparable, but that just's comparison
Impossible, like dope that don't move

And one cold afternoon, you'll get shot at your home
Now, I smell pussy, pussy got lips
But it don't talk to me, that's why you my bitch
And you on my dick

Thug nigga 'till I die, and I ain't even try
See the murder in my eyes, nigga fuck the other side
I don't give a fuck! I will burn your jheri curls
Yayo is his bottom bitch, Banks is a girlie-girl
Don't worry 'bout Whoo Kid, Macho smacked his face in

I done spoke to God, man, He can't even help him, help him
Big up to Maybach Music
Got them choppers man, don't make us use it
Hits out the park, they call me Big Papi
Even if you shot me, you still couldn't stop me
Still went to Africa, still wore the big chain
Where you got robbed at? Nigga, on the same stage
I say the shit that you can't say
Cause I am not a snitch, I ain't bitch-made
David beat Goliath
The meek will inherit the earth
Deeper
Triple black Benz, Lord, forgive me for my sins
I put hits on all you niggas, includin' some old friends
Money come and go, but the trill will remain
Bitch, I keep it real like I'm still dealin' 'caine
Realest shit I wrote and I put this on this quote
Before I had a flow, I had a kilogram of coke
Money on the flo', twenty homies on the books
Fat mob boss but I'm runnin wit the crooks
No need for a vest, that'll suffocate the flesh
I'm Martin on the balcony anticipatin' death 
Let the rifles sing, cause "I have a dream"
My Coretta Scott-King in the tub full of cream
Pink champange seem to take away the pain
While the blue hollow points penetratin' all the lames 
Money ain't a thang, bitch, that's a lie
It only controls every bitch that's alive
Money manifests, haters gotta die 
Tia never told you that that motherfucker rides
Niggas takin sides, crack smoking wives
Cracking crabs at the tables, count the cash, crack the wine
Snakes gotta feel it, beef never squashed 
This time I'm embark on my Million Man March
I'm unorthodox, name me the victor
In the suite wit Shaniqua and that brain off the Richter
Marquise knocks, Marquise stop
Then I give him 50 Cent, that's Marquise' pops
I put a milli on it, this pussy don't want it
Show up in his hood wit the wolves by the mornin' 
Nigga, this a gift, maybe you could live
My music is the mob, it is what it is
Strapped to a T, as real as it gets
Only boss getting money with the Bloods and the Crips
Amen
Deeper than motherfuckin' Rap, nigga
Once you crossed that line
It ain't 'bout, North or South
It's about money and power, riders and punks
We know how the story goes nigga, contract killers
It's not a threat, it's a promise
Money long as 183rd Street, nigga aka Miami Gardens
You could make that list too, nigga
Amen
The Lord is my light and salvation, who shall I fear?
The Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?
My evil and foes come upon me to eat up my flesh, they shall stumble and fall
Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear
Though war should rise, in this I shall be confident
It's deeper than rap, niggaI seen a homeboy die in cold blood
Eyes rolled in his head wasn't no love
His momma sold pussy daddy was a fiend
He from a place where niggas don't believe in dreams
Niggas snorting powder 
I seen a homeboy die in cold blood
Eyes rolled in his head, wasn't no love
His momma sold pussy, daddy was a fiend
He from a place where niggas don't believe in dreams
Niggas snorting powder, get your head right
Get your dick sucked, sittin' at the red light
Now you catchin' cases
Talkin home invasions
How you get a bond
How the fuck you playin'
Can't be playin games on the home field
Open up like a YAGHHHH, when that dome peel, YAGHHH
We didn't have shit when we went to school
Now it's flatscreens up in every room
Nigga do the math bucket full of crab
Tub full of money candy on the slab
Teflon underneath my fresh tag
Bal harbour walkin out with 40 bags
I could fuck a model for an autograph
8 cars, still make her call a cab

They steal your whole sound: that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathin' like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I'd never hit a woman, never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife'
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eatin' good: vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissin' girls ‘cause it's hot, right?

Screamin', "Sosa, that's that nigga that I like!"
I don't want relations, I just want one night
‘Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like
I got tats up on my arm ‘cause this shit is life
And I stunt so much in clothes ‘cause I'm livin' life
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealin' light
Bitch, I'm high off life, got me feelin' right

She blowin' up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em, just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, another thirty for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas!

In the south with the AC set at 69 at all times

A young Michael Corleone
Custom made suits and designer shoes 
Takes two hours to go through my shoes 
Ex-slave, proud field nigga
Next Trayvon Martin, Emmett Till nigga
My nappy hair, who say that life is fair 
My family mean the world although I'm never there 
These days nothing makes sense
Sad, seeing all these Gs on this fake shit 
Text a nigga phone, avoiding my calls 
Only thing you got is your word and your balls 
Get up on my level you say you a boss
Everybody seen it we know that you're soft 
Heard you went and got a lawyer, you niggas is lost 
If they say I'm not the biggest? You tell them they false 
I'm out in Vegas and I'm tricking off 
Out in L.A. Freeway Ricky Ross 
Testified on over 40 dudes 
I seen the documents, I'm who he wanna sue 
He testifies for a state allowance 
Then does a blog like your favorite coward 
Down to roll, I might enroll and graduate from Howard 
I love to roll and marinate just enjoy the sour 
Or another hooligan at U of M 
Bitches on the honor roll? I need me two of them 
When it comes to chicks I need a few of them 
Had a set of twins, now I got me two of them 
Sit the marbles statues on the glass floors
Glass slippers, no cracks for the Task Force
Every mil' I count, my Momma screaming, "Yes Lord!"
Geechi ring on every finger at the chessboard
I fell asleep half naked
I woke up to a sexy Jamaican 
Penthouse suite 59th floor 
The other 58 were totally vacant 
True wealth, in seek of this true wealth 
True wealth, in seek of this true wealth 
I once made love to a princess
For security reasons let's call her Empress 
I'm well groomed ready for the throne 
I learned that petty wars can take a toll
Holy Ghost reading through the book of Job 
Overdose, pleading for my pot of gold 
Smoking dope, hoping that I don't explode 
Try to open up my mind, I got a hundred hoes
Brain, all I want is the brain
I'ma give my son the game, tell him, "Stay away from fame"
I'm just tryna be a better boy 
Every year they say I'm selling more 
Look at the bitches that you settle for 
This the yacht club, leave them on the paddle board 
True G, Geechi Liberace 
In the three piece, suede black Versace 
We could take over the world 
We could take over the world
Sit the marbles statues on the glass floors
Glass slippers, no cracks for the Task Force
Every mil' I count, my Momma screaming, "Yes Lord!"
Geechi ring on every finger at the chessboardWell, it is a weepin' and a moanin' and a gnashin' of teeth

I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit
Tell 'em gimme fifty million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-yo-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press kit
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is meltin' like Dalí

Black diamonds, backpack rhymin'
Co-signed by Louis Vuitton 
Horsepower, horsepower

Believe, believe, believe, believeYou could die young out here
Mess around and die before 21 out here
Mamas stressing, seen them ratchets in the dresser
She not asking questions
She seen the vests and seen other kids in the casket restin'
Weed so loud they got surround sound
Smoking good shit cause they tryna take me back to some hood shit
Any club, any fly affair
If they start shooting all they remember is Nas was there
Some homies of yours bangin’ affiliation on their personal time
Conflict with business can hurt down the line
It’s something that you ain’t have nothing to do with
Your man confrontation end up getting you hit
Learn how to draw the line from when we hang with the shooters
Strippers, dealers and killers, leeches and opportunists
Where I come from it’s ruthless, air you out from the Ubers
Tutored by coke movers, put holes through ya'
You wouldn’t get that from me though, you’d overlook me
Looking like I just get to that money and stay in some pussy
Got a pretty real dope life
Fly nigga from the other side, hecklers, PKs, 9’s and .45’s
7.62’s, deer-hunting rifle shells, life is hell
Pussy sweeter than wine tasting
But we won’t self-indict ourselves
Be our own prosecutor, won’t 25-to-life ourselves
We bout that moolah, rich shooters
You getting money, got a body then you one of us
Trust
You getting money, got a body then you one of us
Calculating, touching money, these niggas masturbating
Tailored clothes, fashion magazines, they fascinated
Double-M umbrella, the feds call it tax shelter
Hit a million, they conspire to send the rats at you
Cha-cha-cha-cha, slide, catch me on that other side
Foreign cars, private jets, high rate of homicide
Marc Jacobs chocolate diamonds, they for my white bitch
Atheist, but her pussy could be so righteous
Follow the rules, never let a man take your jewels
And if he do, double back make sure he make the news
It ain’t arrest, they ain’t a pussy til it’s time to bust
You gettin’ money, got a body then you one of us
You gettin’ money, got a body then you one of us
Trust
You gettin’ money, got a body then you one of us
Dice game, head crackers, time to get it back
Only one in the studio that could get a pack
Raw deal, rob a nigga like it's on my appeal
Closest friends do us best, regardless how I feel
Went to the lot and got ‘em bitches on the same day
Straight to the jeweler, and did the watches the same way
Young sav on face time, talking cake time
Next crib I build got to cross state lines
Niggas hate how I wear my heart on my sleeve
And half the team, got the choppers with the shoulder slings
It ain’t a rust, stay in the trap til you a hundred up
You gettin’ money, got a body then you one of us
You gettin’ money, got a body then you one of us
You gettin’ money, got a body then you one of usY'all niggas sniffin around, askin questions
Followin a nigga, heh

I got them keys in the crib
You wouldn't find them if you had the keys to the crib
Them niggas cheesing, it's real
It ain't cheese if it's less than a mil'
I think I'm losing my religion
Praying on these niggas, wrap a kilo in a ribbon
Live every day like it's my last
My only trending topic is the cash
I see no nigga in these clear Cazals
Bitch-ass nigga, better get some mail
I'm riding in a 6 like this bitch for sale
That boy Meek Mill squeeze clips for real
See me in the street, rose-gold everything
Moving like hoes got me plotting on your team
Learning your whereabouts, burners to air 'em out
Bitches a motion picture, I'm picturing Paramount
Riding in the Lotus, Teflon Don
With an ambitious bitch, lotus flower bomb
Wale on burn, young nigga's doing numbers
Double M G got it the next ten summers
I'm trying to do it big forever
Keys to the crib, and I'm with whatever
Keys to the crib, nigga, bricks wherever
Hundred mil' plus til we rich forever
I got them keys in the crib
You wouldn't find them if you had the keys to the crib

I think I'm losing my religion
Praying on these niggas, wrap a kilo in a ribbon
Live every day like it's my last
My only trending topic is the cash
I see no nigga in these red Cazals
All I see is women with these massive tails
All I see is young'uns with this trash to sell
They got some C.O.'s that get you hash in jail
Little dope, little coke, talking cash for real
Funeral's never cool, nigga, pass the steel
I'm a guru in the kitchen, whipping mass appeal
Boobie got a life sentence on his last appeal
That's one of few names that'll last for real
Got me drinking from the bottle, no glasses filled
Always purple in the cup, nigga, pass the pills
I'm the first one here to fuck, snatch your ass for real
Keys to the crib, boys, keys to the V
If you at the table, then you eat what I eat
Breathe what I breathe, drink what I drink
Smoke what I smoke and we still mink for mink
I got them keys in the crib
You wouldn't find them if you had the keys to the crib
Them niggas cheesing, it's real
It ain't cheese if it's less than a mil'

Praying on these niggas, wrap a kilo in a ribbon
Live every day like it's my last
My only trending topic is the cash
Keys in the crib, you want keys to the crib
I got work from Argentina and Belize in the crib
Homie holding a nina, could sneeze him a brick
Knee-deep in the cocaine, trees in the six
Biggie on the stereo, seven-digit flips
The scenario: something go wrong, it's a burial
Hit the hood, watch it go around like a merry-go
White seats, new M5, all cherry though
Heard you at Aces, Courvoisier
Toasting the niggas that beat cases
Knowing your connect on a name-to-name basis
Eating with your fam on a day-to-day basis
Weight shit, get the big house and the spaceship
Team of loyal niggas
That'll fucking boil niggas for a chain or a bracelet
Nigga, you know I'm living fly
For the love of the game, I put a ribbon on the pie
I got them keys in the crib
You wouldn't find them if you had the keys to the crib
Them niggas cheesing, it's real
It ain't cheese if it's less than a mil'
I think I'm losing my religion
Praying on these niggas, wrap a kilo in a ribbon
Live every day like it's my last
My only trending topic is the cash
If I'm rich now
Is it too much to pray to be rich forever?
Forgive me Lord! Forgive me
My next move: God Forgives, I Don't
I think you'll love it
Rich Forever!Uh, tell me what your crib worth
I hear you talkin' war‚ but have you lived first?
I'm just here to keep it real‚ not make you feel worse
May be a lost cause‚ but let's still search
Until the day I die, holdin' my guns high
Rather have a friend than enemy, which one am I?
Fuck a bird box‚ I wanna see my brother fly
No longer shackled in chains, young nigga crucified
Walkin' down the block holdin' my boom box
Optimistic dirty nigga, clean tube socks
They gon' keep us in the ghetto 'til we move out
And we need some better books stocked in that schoolhouse
Rolls Royce weather
Rich dirty nigga‚ it took so much effort
I don't give a fuck about who sold more records
Bein' self-made give me so much leverage, Boss
Ooh
Got money, got women, got cash, I'ma spend it on you
Maybach all tinted, but you see how you're livin', ooh
It's a lifestyle, yeah 
I'm so iced out 
Iced out, yeah
Look 
How many niggas on your payroll?
Rich gangbangers, y'all ain't even know they make those
Double caseloads, push buttons, I got say-so
When it's war time, never lay low, y'all play roles
I can't name a fake nigga that was not exposed
How y'all niggas so surprised that Tekashi told?
Ain't a real street nigga 'less you got a code
Mines one comma, nigga, followed by a lot of O's
In the back of the 'Bach, rock a lot of gold
Rap music on the charts like it's rock and roll
Add somethin' to the art, make a lot of dope
Gotta play my part from the start 'cause that's all I know
Double M's, double R's, nigga, all I roll
Court side, goin' viral when them punches thrown
On Crenshaw takin' pictures like we Rich and Po
'Nother rich rap nigga, word to Ricky Roz' 
Yeah
Ooh
Got money, got women, got cash, I'ma spend it on you
Maybach all tinted, but you see how you're livin', ooh
It's a lifestyle, yeah 
Hell of a lifestyle, yeah 
Iced out, yeah
It's a rich nigga lifestyle
Heard they wanna put ya boy to rest just like I'm Malcolm X
Jealous of my point-of-view, watchin' the sunset
I just keep on movin' so you won't catch a contact
All my dirty niggas showin' me where the love at
Drop the top, candy painted, haters eliminated
Take a photo for fanatics, I often demonstrate it
Rich nigga, dirty game, I'm talkin' Nick Saban
Rich reignin' every day, whiter than Dick Cheney
Dirty nigga, but my sneakers new
She can go and get the two-door in a week or two
Dirty nigga with a couple things I could treat her to
Or maybe send her to the jeweler just like Meek'd do
Real niggas that was born to kill
Dirty niggas touchin' 40 mil'
40 cars on the sporty wheels
Gold bars in my shorty wheels
Ooh
Got money, got women, got cash, I'ma spend it on you
Maybach all tinted, but you see how you're livin', ooh
It's a lifestyle, yeah 
Hell of a lifestyle, yeah 
Iced out, yeah
It's a rich nigga lifestyle
Ain't nothin' changed but the commas
They say the more money, more problems
But you don't really want these problems
So watch what you say to me
Shorty, come easily
You ain't who you claim to be
I'm just tryna keep it real
Ain't no fucks around here
'Cause we're self-made
This forever is the lifestyle
Ooh
Got money, got women, got cash, I'ma spend it on you
Maybach all tinted, but you see how you're livin', ooh

She ready to blow

Siting back with these paper falling in my lap
Feeling isolated nothing but them hundred stacks
When your money up tell me who you supposed to trust
Every night a different women fucking money up
My bank account in shape, I can run with Puff
I came to put you down shorty so what the fuck is up
Since I met her she can't keep that pussy off me
On a pill I'mma kill that pussy softly
Back to back tryna show you how gangster move
Keys to the pent, talking infinity pools
V12's ain't a thing tryna change her name
Papers stuffed in her purse can't hear her phone ring
She know it’s gametime when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back
She can get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
And when I shoot I don’t miss , I don’t miss 
I don’t miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
Hold up
The bigger the boat, the better the bitch
Not only boats, baby girl, I ships
A million copies since '96
Plus that 95 South love, I double dip, damn
Dope man I need a dope bitch
So I can divvy up all of this dope shit
I know Versace, know Givenchy, know Guiseppe
Emilio Pucci, introduce you if you let me
I know Stella, Margiela, Marc Jacobs
Micheal Kors fuck 'em all, custom made stuff
I'm a made nigga, you a maid nigga
Get a way, getaway, get away nigga
Jumpin' off boats, hoppin' off another cliff
Every six months I think I need a new bucket list
To whom it applies
Who fuckin' with me
I'm the greatest alive
Love, I know you agree
Getting money come natural stunt in my past time
Making love fucking like it's my last time
You know we fight and fuck, you know we fuck and fight
Ain't nothing perfect baby this is fucking life
Street battle tested, dreams manifested
When we was selling things nigga we was breaking records
Dom Pérignon running down my tatted arm
Other bitches hating on me and my baby born
Had her running with the low and shorty took the charge
Already out on bond, shit I would been scared
She did it like a chief while I was going hard
Now the world is yours, it's your time to ball
From the night to the morn’, yeah she tryna lay
Got a freaky, freaky game and she tryna play
Couple more shots baby can you make it stay, stay up
Lay up, lay up
Might just slap the backboard, give you what you ask for

Gettin' rich in a rush, yeah you know us
We the usual suspects

Blowin' money cause I can and I love it
From nothin', to somethin'
You know us, we the usual suspects

17, time to man up
Feed the fam boy, I put that on these canned goods
All I got was diabetes and a damn Ugg
People talkin' down, callin' me a damn scrub
Young niggas, all you want to do is roam free
On your own feet, got to cook your own beef
I'm too cool for lame dudes to ridicule
I laugh while I'm doin' laps in the swimming pool
I don't owe you niggas nothin'
Throw me two fingers when you see a nigga stuntin'
Black Philip Drummond, limousines are the Hummer
Penthouse suite, pretty beach, I call her Summer
Lot of homies passed, see 'em in the future

And still my talent is yet to be challenged
Had no jet with my own pilot, no blastin' off with Flex or DJ Khaled
My mom stressin' college
But my crude sense of logic did allude to my empty wallet
Try spittin' on a green tinted Accord
Which could mean a sentence up North, where the homie was
But back then dough was like a whore that Goldie love, it didn't exist
And Officer Foldy Cuffs was after my wrists
Was not Beverly Hills where we chilled
Imagine this, the Nazareth had to get from rags to rich
I used to stand on rooftops with two Glocks
Figurin', how do I turn my Timberlands to Crocs?
Now reptiles was left out, I'm 'bout a watch, what is you thinkin'?
Murk you, plus the muscle that you bringin' is nothing to me
If you thuggin' or fake and shanked on Cuban, shout out my Ricans
Dealt with all of you gangstas from the roughest Jamiacans and Haitians

If you follow physics, nigga, money never float
Meanin' every day I'm livin' tryna stay afloat
Comin' from a boss, I can predict a double cross
Handlers managin' money they'll never come across
Aspen to Africa, magnanimous numbers involved
AK-47s singin' winter, by summer you fall
I dealt with broads and those willin' to sell they soul
Over cars and clothes, man I'm talkin' petty hoes
As my fetti grow, fuck her, feed her Spaghetti-Os
I'm club hoppin' in Cali, shout out to Harry-O
Somebody dim the lights, triple black tux
Keyser Söze in the flesh, it's time to catch up
I run with niggas who destined to get a life sentence
Get they baby mama a Lexus for them nice visits
My nigga got a dub and love to do the push ups
I got a million cash, tryna get the kush up

It's hard as hell for a young Florida boy
Where we play football and sell dope, man
Gold rims and sticks, 7-trés, no tops, ya dig, candy paints
Yo
Gold rims, good dope, make a wonderful summer
Heard I was a genius, when coming to the numbers
Do it for the young fathers, still signing the lease
And all the hustlers who got somethin' in common with me
If I got the keys, then it's a car I'ma keep
When I line her up they say I remind 'em of Meech
Shootouts in Miami, can't spend no time on the beach
Do or die, get a plug, I got a hundred ki
Brought her to Florida, she fell in love with lobster
Then I bent the corner with a couple drops
Get your money, let's reward ourselves
Life a test and every day we got so much to fail 
Told you the world was yours, now you in a cell 
Center of attention, now you by yourself
Always did the shopping, now you're on the shelf
Next time you see your daughter, bet her heart'll melt 
Pray for your niggas, if can't do nothin' else 
Pray you see the bigger picture, look at momma health 
Wake up, nigga, wake up
Let down the top, nigga that's your paystub 
It's hard as hell for this Florida boy 
Home of young niggas killin' with no remorse, with no remorse 
Home of young niggas killin' with no remorse

Old school, big-ass rims, sittin' like Tonka Toys 
I got a Florida state of mind now, I be on my grind now
Let my niggas shine now, they on
I could've been a student, my mind was polluted
Project unit nigga, I could smell all the raw sewage
Told myself, "Time to go do this"
Sidelines, can't be switching up like I'm Ray Lewis
For the young niggas watching, I'm rocking my jewelry
Turn it into franchises as you maturing
Jonny Dang seen a lot of chains
Substituted for them days I miss my father's face
Wake up, nigga, wake up
All these politicians need they face cut
Beefing with niggas you went to school with
Easter Sunday at church, prayed in the pulpit
I'm rocking Rollies with homies I made some moves with
I'm buying homes for the woadies we toted tools with
Quit acting funny, get money, and fuck some new chicks
Or get buried with niggas you broke the rules with
Yeah, bitch, I'm a Florida Boy
73s to them AMGs, now we rollin', boys 
Yeah my momma raised me, FLA paid me

I ain't gotta hate no nigga, I just keep on winnin'
My bitch'll pull up in the Chevy, you can't keep up with her
You ain't gon' hit me for no lick, bitch I keep it on me
Top down by myself, but I'm never lonely
See, I ain't really finna have remorse for ya
This ain't a Maybach but my Audi A8 seats go way back

No denim on my seats, baby you gon' need a towel
Ride sexy through the city, see me, you will be aroused
My bankroll so well endowed
Pull bitches from MIA to ATL in style
And in crowds catch me in Tao, on the strip in Vegas
Chillin', fillin' bitches' faces with babies
Bitch bite your tongue, this just ain't a Mercedes
Tell the ATF I'm ridin' with another .380
That's my car cost, y'all thought I would fall off
That was just a small loss, we can have a ball off
Fly to NY, meet me at the Waldorf-
Astorian, Architecture Victorian
Ridin' in the past like you're drivin' a DeLorean
Hard times, never heard of those in the 'Bach
My feet kicked up, gettin' my dick sucked with the curtains closed
And for the record kid, my final question is
How yo' bitch gon' feel in that when you two pull up next to this?
Hahahah, Maybach Music nigga!
Everybody knows how the story goes
Money and clothes, they gon' come and go
But guess who stays the same? You gon' see the name
Stroll real slow, when the curtains roll
Yo, piff that I'm blowin' on is fuckin' up the ozone
Plus I keep a dope line similar to Cold Stone's
Ice cream, pipe dreams
Is what they have when I pull up in that light thing
I put a hurtin' on, I got the curtains drawn
Whoever ain't gettin' shitted on, I'm squirtin' on
I'm in the six-deuce, fifty-sevens for the help
Chopper in the trunk, .45 for the belt
Bunch of wax dummies, all you guys gonna melt
Live for your kids, die for yourself
Bottles in the sky if you ride for the wealth
Peas on the block, pies on the shelf
If I ain't in the back of the 'Bach, I ain't in nothin' else
Haha, I'm somethin' else
Everybody knows how the story goes
Money and clothes, they gon' come and go
But guess who stays the same? You gon' see the name
Stroll real slow...
Huh 
Huh, cigar please
I came alive like a moth in the summertime
Japanese wheel blades all samurai
Shine brighter than them bitches on the other side
Time to make a blind motherfucker recognize
Ammunition got the competition nonexistent
Had to bubble crack but didn't have a pot to piss in
I'll double that, how dare you try to knock a nigga?
Street scholar, graduated no father figure
Still tote chrome, check my chromosomes
Meet me halfway with things in a mobile home
Money machines, yeah they "rrring" like a mobile phone
I'm a 7-Up and need a Coca-Cola loan
I'm in the hood like I'm James Evans
Cashmere hand-made sweater
Me and money got a vendetta
Lookin' back, to tell the truth I could've did betta 
Parents never had a good job
Now it's Black American Express cards
Uhh , Rozay!You understand? When I get to heaven, I'll see my grandmother there. She'll say "Great God almighty, here come my child! He must've got here by prayer." Did y'all hear that?

And they ain't using hands
Bands a make her dance
Bands a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy
I'm just poppin' bands
Bands a make her dance
Bands a make her dance
These chicks clapping
And they ain't using handsIf I could leave this place
With a smile on my face
I'd give up everything
Just to make you happy
But we both know, oh, oh, oh
This ain't how live goes
We could build our own world
But the streets keep callin' me
The meek shall inherit the earth
That's what The Bible says
I need it
Walk like a giant, talk like a tyrant
Faith of a mustard seed, destined for a triumph
David or Goliath, hate me or admire
Kush burns slow, as I chase my desire
Embrace my empire, Batty Boy, eat fire
Guns like choirs, when they sing, "Keep quiet"
"Will I get to heaven?" Turn to Psalm 27
Lord knows when I see this Monkey, I'mma be The Devil
Beat him cause I'm clever, beat him at whatever
You never was a G, nigga, Unit mean together!
New York unified, Down South love that
When we got to shine, "Motherfuckers, where the love at?"
Real niggas gettin' Money, better log off
Think the game's dead now?
Now imagine when your dog gone
Imagine when it's all gone
When your phone off, there's only one to call on
If I could leave this place
With a smile on my face
I'd give up everything
Just to make you happy
But we both know, oh, oh, oh
This ain't how live goes
We could build our own world
But the streets keep callin' me
I mean, if I die today
I could honestly say
Thank you, Lord
Thank you, Lord
Thank you, Lord
I'm bigger than a title, bigger than a name
You could label we the biggest label in the game
Put food on the table, fed the whole city
Tell me who be the fool if The Feds come get me?
Fetty isn't better, when you're called a trendsetter
When world's so cold, hope you got a little sweater
Caught a little case, but he had a little cheddar
Pled-out to fifteen, poured his life in a letter
Very first line, he called Trick Daddy stupid
Say he got AIDS, tellin' people that it's lupus
Not the one just to jump to conclusions
I'm gettin' money, small talk could be a nuisance
Both chains, reminiscin' to them nooses
Sittin' on deuces, new Land-Cruisers 
Who the fuck you callin' losers?
You niggas losin', look like you could use us
If I could leave this place
With a smile on my face
I'd give up everything
Just to make you happy
But we both know, oh, oh, oh
This ain't how live goes
We could build our own world
But the streets keep callin' me
When I bought my first Run DMC vinyl
And my first 2 Live Crew cassette
I would've cried if I knew where I'm at today
Took me forty minutes to walk there to buy it
Call your boy a C.O., but if I really was
When all these niggas undercover fuckin' niggas up?
Keep it Trilla, nigga, never had a gun and badge!
Kept a nice watch, smokin' on a hundred sacks
Back in the day, I sold crack for some nice kicks
Skippin' school I saw my friend stabbed with an icepick
Young nigga, fifteen with three seeds
From that very day, I carried on the three C's
Can't criticize niggas tryna get jobs
Better get smart, young brother, live yours
Only live once and I got two kids
And for me to feed them, I'd get two gigs
I'd shovel shit, I'd C.O
So we can bow our head and pray over the meatloaf
I'm lookin' at the big picture
Keep a bitch wit'cha, tryin' to get a bit richer
If I could leave this place
With a smile on my face
I'd give up everything
Just to make you happy
But we both know, oh, oh, oh
This ain't how live goes
We could build our own world
But the streets keep callin' me
I remember prayin' for, for me just to get the, the opportunity
To have a record deal
And now I sign artists
Thank you, LordJahlil Beats, holla at me!
Closest ones to me want to see me in a box
Is it jealousy or am I cursed by the gods
My son's mother don't know when or where to start
All the years that I known her, trick never had a job
Unemployed that'll get a bitch depressed
But unlike them other, boys she watched me kill 'em with finesse
I took a turn pussy boy, pick up a book and learn
Have your ass in a church before I end the verse
Rims on the whip got it looking hypnotic
Stuffing money in my pockets as you niggas watching
Crocodile python, all my ice on
And ain't nobody fucking with me while the mics on
She so ecstatic when I fuck her with the lights on
I feel the same when my niggas send the kites home
Damn, why they want to stick me for my paper?
They want the deeds to my fruit of labor
Every time I turn around
Lawsuits put a lean on a king crown
Ten million was the last check
Devil on the deal, the nigga death in debt
They want to own every thing I own
They sends drones to survey my home
Zeus and Zion to protect my wealth
Bloody Glock 40 to protect myself
Cubans on my neck looking like a python
On the couches I'm the one they got their eyes on
Skip your name, now they want to know your tax bracket
Tell 'em that you with me and the pussy's automatic
I paid dues in these streets
I gave so much I got nothing to lose in these streets
Family asked me am I in Illuminati
Beat twenty cases like John Gotti
White man fear a nigga with a free mind
And if you disagree tell him that he can free mine
Took my Rolex and gave me an ankle monitor
So many angles these haters'll start popping up
Renounced my citizen and move to Singapore
Couple tax breaks all accounts offshore
Damn, why they want to stick me for my paper?
They want the deeds to my fruit of labor
Every time I turn around
Lawsuits put a lean on a king crown
Ten million was the last check
Devil on the deal, the nigga death in debt
They want to own every thing I own
They sends drones to survey my home
Suits designed to protect my wealth
Bloody Glock 40 to protect myself
She fell in love with the flow, such a beautiful stroke
Fascinated allegation kilo grams of that coke
Roll with 25 and never knew his social number
Mac-11 for that Gucci belt to go up under
Black man's pride, see it in my eyes
Fayette county prosecutor want to take a nigga house
So much disdain for the police
Clan rally niggas swing from them old trees
Wood wheel in the Wraith and the skinny ties
Crocodile python seats and the carbon fiber
Hot boy, stash box. and the gas tank
Man of leisure to the top I took the staircase
Damn, why they want to stick me for my paper?
They want the deeds to my fruit of labor
Every time I turn around
Lawsuits put a lean on a king crown
Ten million was the last check
Devil on the deal, the nigga death in debt
They want to own every thing I own
They sends drones to survey my home
Suits designed to protect my wealth

You can't ever get back
So I'ma take advantage
I'm not tryna be managed
I would never take it for granted
But while you're all over me
Since we huggin' we might as well gon' kiss
Since we talkin' we might as well reminisce
Since we kissin' we might as well gon' fuck
Since I'm fuckin' you, might as well gon' and eat it
Since I bought a Rollie I might as well flood it
Since we spendin' some times you might as well suck it
I can't hold your hand now, I'm countin' money

So I'ma take advantage
I'm not tryna be managed
I would never take it for granted
But while you're all over me
Every time we step out, she keeps me on baller alert
Gotta have tickets just to see these young ballers at work
All I got is my word and rosaries under my shirt
Give you my last, it's not a question, I know what you're worth
Blew me kisses through the window in fed, county jail
Three kidnapping charges, DA denied me my bail
Two million in cash, the property totaled for six
No bonds were needed, I got papis, they're holdin' my chips
These labels be fake, Atlantic a lake
Want you well and run dry, but these levees'll break
But I'm goin' for broke, so far from me sellin' my soul
Decoratin' my home with statues of gold
This is the feeling of a lifetime
That I won't never get back
Aye this the feeling of a lifetime
You can't ever get back
So I'ma take advantage
I'm not tryna be managed
I would never take it for granted
But while you're all over meYou know gettin' money, becomin' a young millionaire
You can lose sight of the things that is important to you
I'd never trade my old girl for all the money in the world
I'd never trade my daughter Toy for all the money in the world
I'd never trade my only boy for all the money in the world
I put my last name first
I can hear my daddy sayin' "lil' nigga go get 'em"
Passed in '99 cancer all in his liver
Shit different since we last spoke, his son's a lil richer
I'd never rap again if I could tell him that I miss him
Why the fuck I own the world when I can't share it with him
Bust his ass his whole life, just want to break bread with him
Cryin' in my mansion as I'm holdin' on his picture
It's a cold and lonely world, I'm flyin' solo on you niggas
Bein' the only boy, definition of a man
All the money in the world still not a big enough advance
Still all the money in the world still not big enough advance
For me to turn my back on me bein' the man that I am

Prayin' for you niggas still stockin' up my pistols
Lil nigga gettin' murdered and buried in all-white
Eighth grade school y'all figure that's alright
Tryna figure out where I'm goin' with my life
As I'm steppin' on the brake and hangin' a sharp right
Did my thing in the streets, seen in the streets

Niggas wanna kill me but I put 'em on pause
Broke motherfuckers better bow to the boss
I'm gettin' high, I'm above the law
Gettin' down and dirty, makin' love to her

To love me baby is too easy
But what I need you to do is just believe me

I'd rather spend money baby, I don't spend time
My pockets on full and so is my gas tank
And all my cars got gas in the ashtrays ?

Niggas ridin' gold rims and they mama po
And they kill a family member for that envelope'
I'm the Lionel Richie to these Commodores
We flipped pies to franchisin' Dominoes

Until this day my people never rat or told
Posted 20 in, I'm talkin' fed pen
The line between us both have gained so very thin
Amongst my boys, I'm W.E.B. Du Bois
Souls of black folk to hustle wasn't a choice
Rap game everybody skimmin' off the top
Fuck the interest as long as you pull it off the lot
Hoes wanna fuck, haters wanna hate
Certified sack boy, black Ronald Reagan
Double M no longer that Buick Regal money
Nickel bag niggas so don't make me put a kilo on it
Negotiatin' for it or either we take it
Niggas even shootin' choppers in a fuckin' cadence
Fell out with some people that I still love
I guess that's how it goes when it's real blood
I remember countin' cash standin' in the trap
I turned my hat to the back, had a hundred stacks
60 M's later, it's 300 tax
Still losin' weight with the south on my back, nigga

Dozen lawyers on the team, I'd rather keep 'em close

Headshot, guess who did it, where the warrants at?
Black bottoms, through the nine into the morning pack
Fifty million up, I think I need me more than that
Restaurants, I bought me fifty and they do they thing
Now I'm into sports, I think I really need a team
I got a room that's on the highest floor
Never switch out on my nigga, no amount of dough

So many niggas out here singin' songs
That's why them choppers hear the note and then we sing along
Everybody got a role, therefore we got a job
Until we meet up out in Vegas, and we got a mob
I got a room that's on the highest floor
Never switch out on my nigga, no amount of dough
'Cause you won't get a receipt, that's when you sell your soul
Hungry niggas sit at home, watchin' pictures you post

In Hawaii, Zion got me livin', fuck the Coast
For my B-day, Dr. Dre gave me another watch
Hundred miles and runnin', I pray it never run it's course
Touch a quarter million, my prayers really rubbin' off
Ah, I catch my breath, and holler "Batter's up"
I get the money, 'cause the stats they never mattered much
M.V.P. I'm from the league where niggas tattle much
Testify on your right hand, put 'em in a Camel Clutch
Fell asleep unconscious, woke up out in Myrtle Beach
Oh, in Vegas with pimps, niggas think they rich as me 
Facts, I'm well connected in this city life
We all in double M-jumpers out on them chilly nights
Gave me a brick until I asked him "What would twenty like?"
On body number ten, so I rarely give good advice

Duffle bag full of hundreds, let her spend my tens
Khaled told you pussy niggas all I do is win 
Rolex  full of boogaloos, my dawgs in the pen
I'm  fucking with a bitch, then she gotta be a ten 
Diamonds on her neck , diamonds on her wrist 
I  put her diamonds on her mouth 'cause it's diamonds on my dick
I got diamonds on my hands , diamonds on my chest 
G5, nigga, twenty thousand, I done made a mess
All the feds taking pictures so I pose for the hoes
Got  the Phantom in the front, shooters at the back door
All the strippers know the tippers, very big difference
Got a gold chain swingin' in my name, eight figures
Time to let your soul glow with a hundred bullet holes
Now you screamin' to the Lord, why them boys done do you wrong?
'Fore I paint the picture, better read the scripture
Here come the Grim Reaper, he in a pair of black Dickies
Life is such a dirty game as you walkin' through the flame
Stackin' all the bodies as they callin' out your name
See me at the new arena, best seats at the game
Haters still send subpoenas but my snipers got a aim
Sell a lot of records, not the money that I made
Or the bitches that we fuck 'cause we share a lot of names
All the jewelers give me watches 'cause they wanna take a picture
I be moving all the product, my new house is on the river
(My new house is on the river, my new house is on the river
My new house is on the river), my new house is on the river
So I had to buy a boat, better yet, it's called a yacht
I was then labeled a boss for the yayo that I cop
Peace
M'-M'
M'-M'
Huh
And I was raised to be a killer but I grew to be a hustler
Beg your pardon, tell you sorry, I don't argue with the customer
And I got two bad bitches and they crying for the white
Play the cards in my hand right, they dyking by tonight
Call the plug, bad news, tell the story 'til it's boring
Sounding sketchy and he know it, I don't care, I need my coin
And that's word to this dirty iron lying on my groin
Any time, get in line like a rhyme in a poem
White lines in my foreign, hit rewind on the porn
That's your main? She my side, couple times, paid my bond
Got a thousand eight grams of that glitter, come and get it
Gettin' bands with the yams, fuck the fans on the Twitter
Fuck the 'Gram, stop playin', white grams, I get rid of
White bitch sucking dick, I'll leave her class on her sweater
While I mash on the pedal, talking shit to her, tell her
That I'm mad that I met her, bitch, don't ever push your head up
Got the smackers on call, sliding bare face and all
No shells, so well done, I let 'em take the vault
Three C's, two M's, one G up in the Benz
One liter of the lean, your main squeeze up in my lens
Fake liter of the lean, your main squeeze up in my lens
Huh
I was raised to be a hustler, but I grew to be a killer

H Money
Convertible music
All I ask is that you hold it down for me
'Cause you told me you would be my everything
If it's love, then baby, put it on me 
We could hustle this together, you and me
'Cause I told you I could be your everything 
If it's love, then baby, put it on me, yeah, yeah
Double M the logo, let the hustle take its course 
I let you fuck me once, you wanna make me yours
Gucci shopping bags, I stuff 'em in the 4x4's
Stop at Louis, post a picture, kill 'em, no remorse
Kill the lights, let's light a candle, come and fuck the boy 
Whisper nothings in my ear you know that I'll enjoy 
What you talkin' not a problem 'cause I handle yours
50 stacks a pocket really just for amateurs 
Lickin' on your neck, might wake up pissing in a cup 
Threw Belaire bottles on ice just for me to bust 
When you do it like I do, I make you fall in love
Never slippin' but the difference is the all above
All I ask is that you hold it down for me
'Cause you told me you would be my everything
If it's love, then baby, put it on me
We could hustle this together, you and me
'Cause I told you I could be your everything
If it's love, then baby, put it on me, yeah 
Kissing on you might create some freaky scenes
Playing in your weave before I spark my weed
Fuck you on the beach, then order UberEats
Come to this crib in Lamborghini trucks, then lose my keys
New hairdo, she do it big, the stack just for the wig
Tinted windows on the whip, Richard on her wrist
Look at how I live, this young nigga rich 
A car wash every day, that dirty money bliss
Cocaine residue all on my Fendi shoes
Wanna see you shine, that's if we win or lose
Told her she can pick my casket and my favorite suit 
I pray we only lasted if we kept it true 
Move you to Miami, that's how gangsters play 
Ass filling out her Fashion Nova every day
Time is money, and it's been a minute now
She a centerfold, every night I pin it down
All I ask is that you hold it down for me 
'Cause you told me you would be my everything 
If it's love, then baby, put it on me 
We could hustle this together, you and me 
'Cause I told you I could be your everything
If it's love, then baby, put it on me 
All I ask is that you hold it down for me
'Cause I told you I would be your everything
If it's love, then baby, put it on me, baby
We could hustle this together, you and me
'Cause I told you I would be your everything
If it's love, then baby, put it on meBaby, you a true thoroughbred, a born winner
I expect you to be magnificent
It's the boss
It gets no better than this 
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with, two M's in it 
This pimpin' is so magnificent
Stop dreamin' it, I'm livin' it!
Oh I, I can show you
Oh I, show you better than I can tell you 
Oh I, I-I can show you
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I'm the Magnificent with a sensational style
Far from bein' shallow 'cause she caught me with a smile
Try to figure out my style, baby that'll take a minute
But if all we got is time, you can't be actin' timid
So we back to playin' tennis, meanin' goin' back and forth
She the one that I adore, so I tried to enter raw
Conscience intervenes, concentratin' on my cream
I'm the king, make a move, pawns all the way to Queens
I'm a don, I'm a boss, I'm a profit, I'm a G
I'm a CEO, which means that I profit off of me
All white tees, still rockin' my Nike Airs
Fresh outta flight school, 'cause I'm fly right here
Ain't nothin' free, I'm chargin' to breathe air
If it's not on Maybach, really who the hell cares?
My money long, my nigga, my money strong
If you ain't gettin' money that mean you done somethin' wrong
Boss!
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with, two M's in it

Oh I, I-I can show you

Down to all of my automobiles, with no miles
Yellow Corvettes, black rally stripes
And I never phone ahead, all she do is hear the pipes
Project bitches, upscale kittens
Fuck her for a minute, that night we countin' digits
Maybach money so I always had a vision
I would always tell my niggas but, ain't nobody listened
Words work magic, haters wreak havoc
Ain't nothin' on my back but the delicates of fabrics
I made a transition from the thieves
To the biggest executive Def Jam's ever seen
Lyor's dream, Sean John suit
And a S. Dot ring, Chandon for my crew
Bad hoes in pursuit, Masspike on a two
Gunplay he a glue, goon with an attitude, holla
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with, two M's in it 
This pimpin' is so magnificent
Stop dreamin' it, I'm livin' it!
Oh I, I can show you
Oh I, show you better than I can tell you 
Oh I, I-I can show you
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I'm the Magnificent with a sensational style
When I decorate a home, marble flowin' like the Nile
Nigga you a clown, here's the number you should dial
Yeah it start with 305, but we end at four pound
"Sak pase" to Zoe Pound, for lifers in O-Town
All them Carol City killers, they're likin' it broke down
Money is a must, Tommy guns on a bus
Allan Zamren on the case so you know what you could suck
Wear red all the time, but really I'm color blind
Wanna catch my attention, nigga? Throw up a dollar sign
One time for the Crips, young G's buyin' cribs
And I smoke with Vice Lords when I visit Mississip'
The game never change, money still a focal
But it's time to rape the game, like Puffy did Total
Like Rev Run in the tub, still smokin'
In memory of Shakir, Boss gotta shout Oakland
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with, two M's in it 
This pimpin' is so magnificent
Stop dreamin' it, I'm livin' it!
Oh I, I can show you

Affordable housin' and they fed us welfare
Showed us Tony Montana, teachers couldn't care less
A young prince in Miami, son of a pharaoh
This is deeper than raps, I can't run from the echoes
And I still hear the screams
Under my mattress box springs, I still see the C.R.E.A.M
MAC-11 next to Grammy invitations
I'm never quiet, tell my niggas all my aspirations
No more beefin' with rappers, it's just murder or nothin'
New positions to master, I perfected the others
Niggas shoot for the Magic, never heard of Mutumbo
These are lucrative assets, golden words that I mumble
This the biggest
Corner store was the stage, I needed management
In a mansion that I could squeeze another Phantom in
Negative people just seem to fail first
I said I'm a genius, put in the legwork
You step to my niggas, suggest you stay alert
No, I've never been lenient, nor a man of mercy
I stick my dick in her, tell her my net worth
Then we stare at each other and see who catch first
A pretty chick, she resembles Stacey Dash
If it was her, she had to kiss my feet and lick my ass
Pussy nigga want war, til' it's bonjour

Veggies on the side of course, kush appetizers

This the yacht club, wanna trust me your lady will
Still spillin' champagne, or is it Merlot?
Fuck it, it's fine wine, my bitch a Virgo

So was number 1, I pray I never fumble
Uh, I used to wear the cheapest clothes
Now my posters in the reefer stores 
I be posted like I’m 7’4"
'Til the day I'm knocking at my heaven's door
Just like Club LIV when that confetti fall
I fell in love with the game, damn it's a distant love
I let her see it just to tell her friends what she saw
200 mil' how I get it, damn I can't be far
I keep my sneakers low cut
Heat fitted, G-5 with the nose up
Self made, St. Regis with the toast up
Room service, Belaire, time to toast up
My attraction have African in them happy homes
Never seen a square nigga with a happy home
All the money generated, double M the greatest 
Rest in peace to every genius that never made it
Don't it sound like I'm dedicated?
Joe Flacco deal, nigga with hot flows
Whole cheerleading squad all through my iPhone
All them hoes in my iPhone, nigga, yeah
Sneakers snow white, nigga, at the 50 yard line 
"It's Kay Foxx reporting live
A Carol City rapper facing the music
Connected to an alleged robbery and assault
Gunplay surrendered at Miami-Dade headquarter
The charge armed robbery means he cannot post bond."
Momma poor, daddy poor, what's the antidote?
Wind through the window blew the candle out
No lights, many cold nights
Hungry belly, burning, yearning rice
Rent late, on a plate, just a blank space
Old girl lookin' at me with the blank face
Made it off a prayer and a saint's grace
AK's kept me in a safe space
Sucka free for the one three
Probably on tour for the one four
Sucka tried to give me life plus one more
But I gave it back and told them "fuck y'all!"
In this day and time I got a '89
Miami state of mind, cocaine, steak and wine
Understand I over came
Made it through rain and open flames
Niggas was sold for, practically nothin'

And offers, I'm not a back-and-forth'er
I don't make friends baby, I make offers
Like you can get with this  or you can get with that 
I think you get with this  cause this is where it's at 
Hate when broke niggas try to play mediator 
Keep your two cents to yourself, you might need it later 
Silence is golden, duck tape is silver 
Professional shooters, Leon and Mathilda

Who do whatever I ask of her, dead Siri 
My theory keep winning as the days change
Yesterday's home-runs won't win today's games, nigga
Win today's games, nigga, uh
Life's a game, it's only how you play it
Take advice from a few who made it

Even I look in the mirror, like "Is it you?"
Then I say "I must be the hottest if it isn't you"
Stay fresh, from my top to my tennis shoes
New coupe, no top, big tennis shoes
Never slippin', even on the side of a swimming pool
We don't get ridiculed, we get rid of fools
They said I couldn't play football, I was too small
They said I couldn't play basketball, I wasn't tall
They said I couldn't play baseball at all
And now every day of my life, I ball
And they say you ain't great until someone assassinate
And I feel like MLK
Yeah, "I Have a Dream" to be your worst nightmare
Now meet The Boss of The Cartel, Ross
I'm a sinner, not Satan
Sittin' on Lorenzos and I seem really patient
Picture the equation
People takin' pictures and they really gettin' flagrant
Flaggin' down my spaceship, sergeant sniffin' for a fragrance
Yayo! Yayo! He wanna sniff the yayo
Flyin' saucer on the hasa, in the casa just to lay low
Make more money man, that's the motto for the mob
Need a blow-job, my motto, get a model for the job
Go hard, no job, hustler, no prob
Post up, nigga what? Finger-fuck your whole squad
Forty round extend-o, flip it for my kinfolk
Luxury tax on them packs, if you didn't know
Bought a new crib, niggas feelin' like I hid
3.2, but I did it for the kids
More guns than a pawnshop
Got my whole arm rocked
Keep the 760 double-parked in the wrong spot
Still hustlin', boss
Yeah, you gotta pay for this
I remember when I used to pray for this
This, this is classic, some shit you might not see again
And we taxin', you don't want it, nigga, leave it then
And we taxin', you don't want it, nigga, leave it then
And we ain't tryna see the Pen
Like a needle in a haystack, we ain't tryna see the 'pin'
This is a luxury tax
Yeah, imagine this, no, imagine that
Gave me my sack, like "Good luck getting back"
I'm like, "The fuck I'm gon' hide it at?"
And if I'm not careful, be the same place they find it at
And I'm a winner, if I make it across the finish line
Puttin' food on the table like it's dinner time
And this is what you call stereotyping by far
Can you tell me my your dog keep sniffin' my car?
Got the audacity to call me a liar
So what you got in your trunk?
Oh, just a spare tire
You niggas talked blow, while I sold mine
Like a bad cramp, it's lockin' up in no time
More time in the kitchen than I spent in the studio
"Gangsta's Paradise", and I ain't talkin' 'bout Coolio
Can't lie, still addicted to the odour
Got a ice cold Pepsi, still thinkin' Coca-Cola
Yeah, you gotta pay for this
I remember when I used to pray for this
This, this is classic, some shit you might not see again
And we taxin', you don't want it, nigga, leave it then
And we taxin', you don't want it, nigga, leave it then
And we ain't tryna see the Pen
Like a needle in a haystack, we ain't tryna see the 'pin'
This is a luxury tax
I'm up early in the morning and I'm dressed in black
Hold on, every morning I get dressed in black
While y'all half-ass, nigga my pants saggin'
I'm gettin' money and my swag, black-flaggin'
Million dollar status, fully automatic
Heavy on the Henny, even harder on the women
If it wasn't for Reverend, I'd probably be pimpin' and shit
Pops, my papi, is already in me
I tried trappin', shit sent me to prison
Got mad and went to snappin', so homicide came to visit
I smell gun powder, so you got one hour
To come up with every damn dollar; or you're done, dollar
It costs to ball, dog
Especially when the players on your team consider you as the ball hog
You treat me like Shaq, and you Kobe
But I ain't say you owe me, nigga
But act like you know me, nigga
Yeah, you gotta pay for this
I remember when I used to pray for this
This, this is classic, some shit you might not see again
And we taxin', you don't want it, nigga, leave it then
And we taxin', you don't want it, nigga, leave it then
And we ain't tryna see the Pen

Pay attention 
Ghost writer blunt lighter
Write a rapper's song then go buy a home
Lyrics they recite these are words I own
Every album that I made I did it on my own
Melodies that I would barter any label the starter
Any nigga with cheddar I bet I can make it better
Wanna live the life so they gotta pay the fee
Last ten years everybody came to me
Politicians propositions bottom bitches washing dishes
No auditions for these bitches many scriptures we've written
Came from the mud I use to piss in the tub
If you never felt love then I considered you blood
Charging for the verses, I'll throw in the chorus
Slip-N-Slide fucked me friendship was aborted
Publishing was something I would have to earn back
So I wrote so many songs I would deserve that
In return I wrote them things that were all to the world
Cause they were some names many names
That’s my word to confirm
That's my word to confirm
That's my word to confirm
It gets so lonely at the top
It gets so lonely at the top
I get so lonely at the top
I get so lonely at the top

I be so lonely at the top
I be so lonely at the top
I be so lonely at the top
I be so lonely at the top
Oh I be so lonely at the top
Fell in love with the travel carry ons and what have you
If a nigga came at you then he was trying to pat you
Ghostwriter put a check on a niggas head
You never knew all at the table cause he hid his hand
Remember receiving words of wisdom from Jimmy Henchman
I lit a blunt in his honor when he received his sentence
So many successful entertainers with tax problems
DMX went homeless and heard he back robbing
Rozay won’t be a old nigga with back problems
In the back of the Maybach with black Tanya
I went out to when I kicked it with met
For the first all the things I could say
It gets so lonely at the top
It gets so lonely at the top
I get so lonely at the top
I get so lonely at the top
I get so lonely at the top
I get so lonely at the top
It be so lonely at the top
It be so lonely at the top
I be so lonely at the top
I be so lonely at the top
I be so lonely at the top
I be so lonely at the top
My ego's intact, my pen is unique
Any pressure we come with sticks like they do at Philippe’s
God gave me a gift therefore I shared it with them
Ghostwriter publisher such a beautiful friend
We give them the slang we lease them the swag
Tell them where they can hang tell them what they should claim
Cheers to hustlers, bitches who wanna fuck us
Ghostwriter never knowing when they are coming to touch us
My team in fatigues diamonds drip to my knees
Mike Caren a leach you’ll all be deceased
Culture is mine these words I define
If you need you a hit I could give you some lines
I could pick you the beat I should write you the hook
You just sit back and smoke, all royalties took
All royalties took 
All royalties took
It gets so lonely at the top
It gets so lonely at the top
I get so lonely at the top
I get so lonely at the top
I get so lonely at the top
I get so lonely at the top

I just heard a bunch of gunshots go off -- my server just left on her bike to go -- Oh my God, they're turning around and coming back
Okay
I'm hanging up, I'm hiding, bye--
Okay, m'am, how many shots did you hear?
I don't know, I don't know, but they're coming back. I'm hiding
"We're being told by people here on the scenes, specifically the manager that a famous rapper was riding in that car when someone opened fire shooting at that car, that car crashing into that building. Police cleaning up the shell-casing markings that were here just a few moments ago. This is still under investigation"
"There was a rapidfire 9 or 10, 9 or 10 shots. You know, rapidfire with rapid succession and odd enough it wasn't a handgun, it was some kind of a rifle."
"Police have leads, but no strong description of the shooter or the shooters who appeard to have targetted South Florida based rapper Rick Ross as he drove down the street"It feels so good
You lying here next to me
Oh
I'm living underneath the telescope
Ciroc in my margarita in Mexico
Got a model with me that I seen on World Star
Introduced her to the world of La Pearla
I'm talking S and M but got her screaming A to Z
Talking the type of cheese she used to think was make believe
I used to fuck 'em then I made 'em leave
Leaving things, I had a bucket full of Maybeline
I had a bucket of my favorite green
Opened up the budget now it's only major things
Mulsanne, run ya half a ticket
Bugatti Boys, cop won't even write the ticket
I got a few crips that wanna come and kick it
Catch blue balls if one of ya nigga's bitches
I know the feeling gotta re-align your wills to life
Or better yet, maybe should write your will tonight

Deeper and deeper
In love with you I'm falling
Sweeter and sweeter
Your tender words of love keep calling 
Eager and eager 
To feel your sweet lips on my face 
Please her and please her
Any time or any place
Got on my Vacheron, I'm paid in full
Lining up all my niggas 'bout to pull some major moves
Consolidate the game and suffocate the others
Keep it real with your niggas and multiply the numbers
Go to trial and never take the stand
Every bitch was born to break a man
I take you deeper than them other dudes
I see my niggas scramble chickens by the twos
He talking like a ho and valeting the Benz
She acting like a bitch while I'm takin' her friend
Ran outta 1's now I'm throwing what I got
I took her home, time to show her what I got
I took her tongue and took it to another notch
I'm getting funds time to get another watch
I'm having fun fucking let my brother watch
I got thirty cars and headed to another lot
Money grew like grass
Money grew like grass
Money grew like grass

Deeper and deeper
In love with you I'm falling

I'm gonna love you, love you, love you just a little more, baby

I'm gonna want you, want you, want you....A month ago, I gave a chick a hundred stacks
Straight to Neiman Marcus, young bitch had a heart attack
Aww man, I love my bitches
Bottles, Beamers, Brand New Benz's
Barbies, ballerina's and Britney's
Barbera Streisand edition Bentleys
Bricks, big face hundreds in bundles
Boy, I'm a boss, I rose from the jungles
God forgives and these killers won't
In a room full of heathens, good niggas die alone
Better start taking notes as I'm taking tokes
The hood wanna see you die and they taking votes
My vision always mentioned coke
My women never sit in coach
Aww man, I love my bitches
Tongue kissin' a dark skinneded vixen
50, 60 racks, I might go blow 100 though
Jet owner, G5, where you wanna go?
Fuck your ex's baby, really, that's your past?
Load up your carry-on's and all it is is cash

Aww man, I love my bitches
Aww man, I love my bitches
Aww man, I love my bitches
East coast to West coast, all my bitches
Tryna' bring you into my world, baby
Just stand there, You the canvas, I'mma paint the picture
You never met another nigga, you know, fuck it, take it
Am I really just a narcissist
Cause I wake up to a bowl of lobster bisque?
And I wake up on some mobbin' shit
With a great view and half my niggas swappin' bricks
It's just a way of life
For the king of diamonds, so I gotta stay tonight
50 cash in the Louis for the chicken wings
Started in a neighborhood and now we on to bigger things
Large clique of my constituents
Combination to the safe, straight to the Benjamins
Living life to the fullest was the emphasis
Making love to Mary J's "Reminisce"
It was all good just a week ago
Paper tag on the Panamera, my speakers blow
My bitch sittin' cute, she left her panties home
Suckin' the dick of the don, I'm talking Miami's own
Money like , money like 
 peelin' two off the dealership in the same day
 paid like Mark Clayton, Mark Duper
Soon as nigga's start hatin', start shootin'
Come along, money longer than Olajuwan's
Lotta one's, all the bitches gotta model one's
Tongue pierced, dick sucked, said "I swallowed once"
50 million, I'm the only one that got it done

Time to get a new Benz, but I'm gon' wait
'Til the feds give my dawg his new release date
Young mogul, but a nigga came from the mud
Say a prayer, pray my son will never be a thug
Came up with a plan nigga, I'm a mastermind
Richest nigga in the hood, I ain't hard to find
Swear to god, on 'em all, nigga self made
And I got a lotta bitches cause I'm well paid
Lord take it, I'm sure to show my war wounds

I smoke with all mine, baby girl, what's your point?
Don't front, you in the back of a long line
Trying to get in, cause only members inside
Trees get twisted up like fingers in gang signs
Purple Kushions broke my fall, I fell from a grapevine
Super high, from the free throw line, I'm
Drexler status, glide the espionage
Many a jealous eyes scrutinze the wise
But the Jets in the house like the curtains and the blinds
It hurt to see me shine, that's why they frowning all the time
In they internet videos, digital CB4s
Angry orangutans, I'm arranging my sneakers
I'm the action on the court, you the gum stuck to the bleachers
I think I'm Paul Pierce, I think I'm Rondo
High off that headband, you dying on that hydro
I thought of this fresh off a bong rip
My bitch next to me, getting undressed for me
Running bath water, playing her favorite songs
While I get another one lit
Don't usually smoke at all but say tonight she'll take a hit
That's understood
From the smell, and by what I paid
You know it's good
Them niggas with me? They from the hood
Now we through parties in the sky
I'm on the 42nd floor, now that's super high
Champagne, more paper planes than you can fly
Them young niggas fell soon as they tried
When the paparazzi flash, I'll be counting all this cash
Plotting a million about how I can build a mountain out of hash
All these cars, all these stars, all around me 
Put your eyes to the sky, that's where you'll find me
Cause we are super high
I'm getting money, no Illuminati
My pain never went in vain, it's all over my body
Get the spliff in my Mr. Bughatti
Kick it with my lil' homies, a Mr. Miyagi
I gotta buy my niggas each a pound
Tweaking up our sneaker style, passing reefer 'round
Spitting only lethal rounds, speakers beating down
Not talking munchies when I say my niggas eating now
Promoter gave me 40 thou, I think we even now
Pina colada, paper smoking, Garden of Eden now
Taylor Gang is what we bleed about
Jet setters in places you only read about
And now, everywhere I go
It's so strong, they ask me where I get my smoke
Bitches don't have to guess, they know
I keep one rolled up, we can do whatever you want
Smoking pina colada papers, baby girl
We don't fuck with them blunts
Unless I'm with the Boss
If you looking for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss, take a look
I'm super fly, I'm super high 
You getting yours, I'm getting mineCall me Bill Gates
I told that bitch to save my number in her phone under Bill Gates ya heard me
Uh, ya heard me
I just need you to do for me what I need you to do for me and imma come through when you need me bitch
Ya heard me bitch
Bitch, ya heard me bitch!
Silk sweaters, dirty Berettas and petty vendettas
Niggas is jealous, I get it, bring it when and wherever
Court dates and caskets, I'm tryna stay composed
Out on bond, on the run, won't ever sell my soul
Doing bad, I shorted my connect a cool mil'
At the lab tryna keep my name out the news reels
Or at the Palms and I know the Feds across the hall
I got a bitch who licking balls, my back against the wall
All black photographs that speak a million words
One selfie with me and they think you're dealing birds
Louis towels and the Gucci slides
Bill Gates still real when it's out of style
I want it all, Wingstops on every corner
I want a mall and I'm about to build a Benihana
Bond out my dogs, quarter million on a new appeal
They call me Bill Gates and they know the money real
They wanna know my name I tell them Bill Gates
Just blew a hundred million and I'm still straight !! 
They started waving flags when the ruckus came
Just put a hundred kilos on the stock exchange
Crack money, Nike sweats, wake up in night sweats
Homemade key lime pie we cutting slices
All my people eat at the table when we say our grace
One eye open for the Judas who wanna take my place
Twelve disciples, I got two shooters, nigga ten bodies
Caught a few niggas living thinkin' that I ain't bout it
Dickie shirts, blood stains, come with the drug game
Cell phones tapped, fast money and cum stains
Public defenders say a number and you niggas tremble
Judge dropped the mallet, may as well put a bullet in you
Louis towels and the Gucci slides
Bill Gates still real when it's out of style
I want it all, Wingstops on every corner
I want a mall and I'm about to build a Benihana
Bond out my dogs, quarter million on a new appeal
They call me Bill Gates and they know the money real
They wanna know my name I tell them Bill Gates
Just blew a hundred million and I'm still straight !! 
They started waving flags when the ruckus came
Just put a hundred kilos on the stock exchange
Cold cases they wanna put me in the hot seat
FingerLicking laugh over lobster in the front seat
Niggas follow me in hopes of finding my stash box
In the ghost like the pope, the all glass top
Look around I smile at you as I'm looking down
Bill Gates, that red Chevy it be thumping loud
I put my niggas on they feet we can't be fucking up
So fuck a hundred bricks, flip a hundred restaurants
I want it all, Wingstops on every corner
I want a mall and i'm about to build a benihana
Bond out my dogs, quarter million on a new appeal
They call me Bill Gates and they know the money real
They wanna know my name I tell them Bill Gates
Just blew a hundred million and I'm still straight
They started waving flags when the ruckus came
Just put a hundred kilos on the stock exchangeShe self made, I'm self made
We're made for each other
They calling me the hottest in the game
Never the gold, I wanted gold plated chains
Have sex on a highway in the Lexus
Suck her neck before I eat her like she's breakfast
Never mind the rumors baby this is me and you
Bail hard but balling 50 on them pretty shoes
With foreign names, valet the Range
Different positions, but she still moaning the same
Millie on my neck, thumbin through that check
Rozay in effect, know how to make her wet
Roses by the dozen, everyday I'm hustling
Blowing money fast looking like I'm saving nothing
Let's take another trip, different continents we touching
Niggas getting flipped, I get them done for nothing
Shout out to Joe and Chris, It's A.P on my wrist
I'm still seeing bricks like it's still '86
Over 20 homes, but I need a chick
And she got the bomb, I'm talking tick tick
She got the bomb, I'm talking tick tick
And if you feel I'm wrong, baby you should tell me this
You can't tell me shit

Silencers give you life but they make a major difference
You play a witness, I heard you snitchin', you paid the hitter
Chanel purses and red bottoms, I'm bookin' tickets

You give her hickeys, I fuck her, duck her and pass to Ricky
My palms itchy, I coulda swore I just hit the lotto
Safe house in Cabo, my Spanish bitch related to Blanco
My blanket Morocco, my carpet is Cuban

Smokin' three pounds of the thunder, it go straight to the brain
Just know the Bulls been the shit, wait 'til D Rose back

In the kitchens with Getty whippin' that Pyrex
The East Coast meets Kanye West
Death Row reeks underneath my breath
Storage wars, all the whores, I walk away
Chad and Evelyn evidence, just a block away
Do the bitches love you when you out the league?
Will my car still crank when I hit the keys?
When did dark skinned brothers learn to ski?
Got a thing for Khloe, Lamar lost his feet
Scott Dis'nick, Taylor check me in a week
Black bottle boy, nigga blazin' peach
Such an amazin' piece, such an amazin' speech
This is easy to me
Ruthless Records, next Eazy to be
May we live long, rich forever
She can hear it in my tone, rich forever
Standin' on my own, Anderson Silva
Break a bone, nigga gone 'til November
Run in your home, put your infant in a blender
Sip on a smoothie or give it up smoothly
Don't panic, only lyrics for my movie
You couldn't handle my tender life, forreal
Hood stripes worth more than my deal
Motherfucker ain't as real
10 mil' in a duffle, make a nigga shiver
St. Bartholomews chillin' for the winter
You makin' wack songs with the nice titles
All chains, no rings, never see the finals
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody 
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you something to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admitting is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgiving
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody 
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouthI just wanna see my mama smile
Here I go
I went unconscious, I woke up to see my mama smile
She told me no more promethazine, that'll make her proud
Think about it, damn I had to think about it
Gimme a second, mama, lemme think about it
I went unconscious, I woke up to see my mama smile
She told me no more promethazine, that'll make her proud
Think about it, damn I had to think about it
Gimme a second, mama, lemme think about it
Never had the chance to tell my dad I was a Yankee fan
True love is unconditional, money don’t make the man
First time me in a batting cage, I knew I had a gift
Which I had to skip, I'm at the car wash trying to make a tip
Positivity is all I got to give
When we was kids, it was steel now it's time to live
That's why I throw a pinkie ring up when I post a pic
It's for my niggas on they dick, "Look what this nigga did!"
Think about it, think about it
40 M's in my Timbs, still ridin' rims
Word on the streets, they say that nigga get a lot of cake
I take the time, I kiss both cheeks on my mamas face
Just smile!
The world had to make me a man, but I'll always be your child!
Mama just smile!
Most importantly, I want you to be proud! Mama just smile!
No I never really mind that we caught the bus
Or that we always stand in line, I’m talkin' all of us
It made me stronger, it made me quicker on my feet
All the gain she gave me the love that she would teach
Turn me onto real estate we bought us 50 homes
Who really gonna be your shoulder when your kidneys gone
Who really gonna be your rider when the Bentley's gone?
Or when they singin' like a choir in a Christmas song?
Mama! Always depend on my mama
Just bought another Benz for my mama
I always keep it real with my mama
She harder than a rock
Throw her parties on the block for my mama
I just wanna see my mama smile
Just smile!
The world had to make me a man, but I'll always be your child!
Mama just smile!
Most importantly, I want you to be proud! Mama just smile!
Makes me happy just to see a smile on her face
Perfect mother and I love you, tell you every day
You always was a black queen, mama
You showed me all the best things, mama
I am at love
Your flesh and your blood
Your unconditional love inside of me
Mama, just smile
Mama, just smile
Mama, just smileLet's dodge rain drops
Follow me
They say I always left a paper trail
Duffle bag in the attic, now how that paper smell 
And I musta left it there for several years
In case of emergencies, go get a set of wheels
Burning tobacco with my ancestors
Learning lessons on my transgressions
Accepting that street niggas we live by different rules
Pill poppin’ everyday I’m in a different mood
They scream our names since we walk the halls 
With everything to gain only fear Allah
Full metal jacket still the wardrobe
Never waste a prayer for peace in a warzone
Pray to keep the lights on your porch on
Even better pray I get to see my boy grow
Before Instagram we did it up in the ozone
Only nigga still killing never told on
Let’s go deep into my cold mind
First and one I got it on the goal line
Fully automatic weapons for my O-line
Wanna buy the team they say I need a cosign
I got a beacon jumping out the gym
My new freak she Puerto Rican trying to reel me in
Hit the homey from the hood I told him fill me in
On top of that he said he good I told him bring me 10
Gentrification across the barren land
I thought the goal was get rich be a married man
Never question my vision I seen atrocities
But I also see profit on selling properties
Still rising enterprising young entrepreneur
Ostentatious globe-trotting out with Lira Galore 
Six mill I’m born I told them they can keep the change
Pick me up in that new ‘rrari swerving lane to lane
Nigga close but it’s no cigar
So it better be that Ghost or that double R
My alma mater is serving fed time
See the streets before god cut off his deadline
Damaged yard so tomorrow grows the prominence
Bastard case you can see that was some common sense
I entertain niggas under poverty lines
So I paint these pretty pictures as part of my rhymes
Crack spots block to block I’ve been a benefactor
I don’t think you understand the type of chips I’m after
Corporations but they run them like their small time
We never see eye to eye if you have a soft side
I told you pussy niggas let the lions in
I told these pussy niggas let the lions in
Your record labels left with rigor mortis
I just closed another deal worth another 40Uh, uh
I'm so compassionate with my compositions
Check it
Fascinated with foreign felines since I was knee high
This cigar got me buzzin' like a beehive
Fuck my old chick, I'm ridin' with my new thing
In her blue jeans, panties like shoestrings
Most wanted, I'm Bin Laden on a beat nigga
Rubber band jeans saggin' on my feet nigga
100 grand for the wagon and her feet nigga
Black flaggin', just braggin', I'm a street nigga
On the grind little rappers wanna eat with us
Tryna shine like Birdman man teeth glitters
VMA find time just to creep with her
So coincidental walkin' down the street with her
My loose cheese scooped up the Gucci
In 2 weeks I flew through the boutiques
She get her time limit when I let her go and shop
Cruisin' in the car, clip the Cuban at the top
Niggas know that my techs explode
Down to go toe to toe before Tecmo Bowl
Biggest boss in the game, chatter I never mind that
Cause if it mattered, C-Murder would go diamond
I reflect as I'm ridin' in a Rolls Royce
Get respect cause I give these hoes no choice
Because I-I-I-I-I
Because I do it
So if you never seen a boss nigga, then look at me
Because I do it
And they never seen a boss nigga, but now they see
Because I do it, and I do it
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay, and I do it
Yeah, so now you see what it means
To be a boss cause I do it
I'm the down-south Nas, click so firm
Ridin' with a fox as the cigar burn
Niggas sell weed, niggas sell coke
If I was sellin' dope, baby I'd be sellin' both
But I'm sellin' records, everythin' I touch gold
Better yet, check the record, 3 million sold
Two handguns on the riders for the show
On the road to the riches and I'm ridin' on 
I elaborate on things I only been bout
Besides, we decides who's the in-crowd, ah
If its Ne-Yo and niggas who speakin' Creole
What I got to prove? We just keep movin' kilos
See the Audemar its call it Terminator
The exact watch only Arnold wore in Terminator
I let her ride me like a elevator
Clip another Cuban as I wait to celebrate her
Because I do it
So if you never seen a boss nigga, then look at me
Because I do it
And they never seen a boss nigga, but now they see
Because I do it, and I do it
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay, and I do it
Yeah, so now you see what it means
To be a boss cause I do it
Fascinated with foreign felines, that's my design
As I recline, cut 'em like key lime
We both came now it's right back to the tea time
I won't insult her being vulgar with no cheap wine
She told me that her other man broke
Walkin' on the clouds of my second hand smoke
I touched her with the second hand stroke
Got her mind racin' quicker than a Lambo
Two-seater, it couldn't fit Toccara
But I promise baby I'll be back tomorrow
In a big Beamer bumpin' Bob Marley
Listen closely and hit her way little softly
Because I-I-I-I-I
Because I do it
So if you never seen a boss nigga, then look at me
Because I do it
And they never seen a boss nigga, but now they see
Because I do it, and I do it
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay, and I do it
Yeah, so now you see what it means
To be a boss cause I do itI bought a mansion in the Bahamas with the all red walls
Snatching lobster out the water, heavy butter for my dawgs
My bitches got ass if they don't we go and get it
Six wheel G wagon, let 'em wrap it with the ribbon

If a pussy be the best, we let 'em know that's via text
Tattoos on my body, head down to my legs
Cash rules everybody 'til they make it to the FED's

Maybach Music
Port of Miami 2
Yes, we are
Yes, we are, oh
Oh-woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, noI said, young black men 
You're now living in a state of public emergency
Middle class and poor people being targeted every day dealing with so much hostility
Negative socialism
I refuse to be petrified
And there's no mercy for the rivals
They want the rich niggas to live in total silence, exile
Flee the country, more assassinations
Let's go
When you're forced to be fearless, strangers consider you careless
Detrimental to my upbringing, I felt so abandoned
I was lost in confusion, therefore had nothing to lose
Now I'm running the rack and nigga got cut from the noose
I just wanna be free, another black man on the run
We was pinned to the cross since I birthed under the sun
Ain't no hate in my heart, I've adapted to rage
Step off the stage, pussy nigga right back in the cage
Now we burning the streets, Christ to the cross
Our position is blatant , rightfully lost
Let's empower the people, no need for signin' petitions
Thieves and Revelations, scriptures keep on blinding these Christians
I'm in search of the truth , we each have a flaw 
Soon as Dre hit the roof, she filed for divorce
Van Jones go get a broom, never making no laws
Terry Crews is another coon who was basically bought
Some say my eyes are like brown diamonds buried in the snow
But I see pain, we have in common, it's not all beautiful
So if I cry and these brown diamonds wash along the shore
It's 'cause I know the shit you've been through and you made it beautiful
You made it 
You made it beautiful
You made it 
Made it beautiful
Racists killing for cotton, niggas fighting for honor
In the South you're forgotten, call my city the bottom
Kilos get to deposits, living like it's the lotto
This my moment of glory, grandiose is the dollar
Always postin' your sneakers, you're the one that they follow
I'm a born to be leader, such a collection of knowledge
Are we dead or alive? Unforgettable highs
Know the Lord lookin' down, for the day that we rise
Got my pistols all on me, niggas my Christopher us homie
Black on black issues over principles peep your opponent
Who got the most money? Well, that's yet to be seen
'Cause I'm still counting mine, such an incredible thing
In seek of true wealth, great example for niggas
You decide it yourself, I considered it business
We still in the trenches, where they made us relentless
Where the reward is little, but the hate is tremendous
Some say my eyes are like brown diamonds buried in the snow
But I see pain, we have in common, it's not all beautiful
So if I cry and these brown diamonds wash along the shore
It's 'cause I know the shit you've been through and you made it beautiful
You made it 
You made it beautiful
You made it 
Made it beautiful
Now I'm in the McLaren, still racin' them commas
I'm watchin' for Karen, she watchin' bird watchers
Still I wish her the best, Ray Charles in the flesh
Pavarotti to some, Quincy Jones to the rest
Muddy Waters to marble, set my city aflame
Turn my back on the mere fact that they would rattle my cage
I don't wanna argue, but I wanted a raise
Got me pinned to the cross, as the sinners will wave
Such a body of work, my debut was a classic
HOV gave me a verse, so that kept it attractive
My whole crew was submerged, DEA wanted the address
Make a play with a pussy, with a few mill' in a mattress
My life needed a balance, didn't come for the status
But my mother responsible, she raised me so lavish
Look, son, you're a king, were the words she recited
And they kept me excited 'til the day I'm indictedWe them niggas at the park, we just wanna ball
Selling dope, then we get a car and don't know what its called
Niggas foul, but the referees don't get involved
It's the finals, and my dogs came to take it all
With the heron, nigga I'm Lebron 
Quarter millie for my car, and that's on the Quran
You running with me, nigga, or you better run
Two times for you pussies 'cause you know who number one
These bitches all on my dick, is it all of my cars?
They say my Audemar sick, just bought a healthy Chopard
This a ten million flip, so nigga, fuck what you talk
100 million off the rip, the definition of boss
She can tell how I'm balling, that I'm just getting started
Yeah, I took an advance, put 20 keys in the projects
Had to scoop my lieutenant, had to make my deposits
Niggas die every time that choppa come out the closet
And I pride myself, I'm getting money in the streets
I ride myself, I'm the one you gotta see
I bring it straight to your door, do you like it, Manolo?
When you flashing that money, them people flashing your photo
Know I'm fucking these broads, 'cause I'm flashy as fuck
Five live-in maids, my crib nasty as fuck
Fi-Five live-in maids, my crib nasty as fuck
Fi-Fi-Five live-in maids, my crib nasty as fuck
Ugh
My money on a another level 
My money on a another level 
She fucking ordinary niggas 
Your bitch be fucking ordinary niggas
Hating with dem bitchs, that's a flagrant foul
I'm posted with that china white, the smokers say it's Yao
A nigga play, I want his head, I'm talking 80 thou'
I tell my shooters go and get 'em, they go make a cow
Riding in a wheels a fortune, then I made a vow

Make it rain on all them hoes and have it dripping on these niggas

Percocets for myself, I feel a hundred degrees
Niggas getting that money, bust it down with your team
From the Chevy to Bentley, from the Bentley to Rolls

They blowin' stacks, they blowin' stacks
They turn they back, turn they back
But then 'em niggas wanna front
They blowin' stacks, they blowin' stacks
They turned they back, turned they back
Watch a nigga fall down
They turned they back, turned they back
Turned they back, turned they back
I watch my nigga turn his back, turned they back
I watch my bitch turn her back, she turned her back
Watch a nigga fall down then she turned her back
But, now I'm back, now I'm back, now I'm back, now I'm back

A Mastermind
Man, it's funny how a nigga act
Like he got shit bad, but really that is just a knack
You know a bitch that called police on you and took her back?
You stole a stack but bitch man, I would take the whole sack
"Say Gucci Mane, you the man, why you doin' that?"
He said "been workin' lockin' up that shit, it won't come back"
I told that nigga "man, there ain't no need to call me that"
When I was broke man these bitches wouldn't call me back
You could pay a nigga's rent, have a nigga back
Even pay a nigga bond what kind of shit is that?
I took the shirt off my back and put it on your back
Then you turned your back, oh what kind of shit is that?
Burr!

They turned they back, I asked 'em why
When they turned back, they couldn't see me cry
A Mastermind
They triple crossed me, left me for dead
They blowin' racks, I'm fucked up, I owe these chicos bread
I'm in the red, I took a loss, had to crawl back
My own niggas crossed me out, now what you call that?
Fucked up my set, my bottom bitch, she turned her back
She want rum and rocky with me, she was chasin' sack
Pussy hoe, she turned her back, that's how she felt
Collect call from Rice Street, that bitch, she run herself
I knew a nigga 10 years, it's a deadly game
Man can win those cracker canes, shawty said my name
Shit ain't the same, there's somethin' missin'
There's somethin' different
Either ya ass get pimped or you're doin' the pimpin'
Slab!
They turned they back, turned they back
Watch a nigga fall down, they turned they back

When they turned back, they couldn't see me cry
A Mastermind
Okay, hoes turnin' back, niggas did too
I was sellin' crack, my niggas did too
Man I ain't see it comin', all the shit we been through
And they ain't see it comin' neither, last time I spinned through
Hard-top bent blue, every time I dipped through
Niggas turned they back on me, tried to fuck my bitch too
And I put 'em on paper, oh that's what this shit do?
Oh, that's how you nigga rock? I be wrong, I get you dropped
I get you wet, nigga turn ya back
Know where I live, I lay you flat, nigga, that's a fact
Put it on my kids, you niggas rats, and I'm comin' back
Look what you did, made me do that, got you niggas clapped
These pussy niggas...
They turned they back, turned they back

They turned they back, turned they back

Niggas hate when you winnin’, you wanna kill ‘em, I feel ya
Took the top off the car, bitch, I know my face look familiar
Fuckin’ with my lil’ gangters, we makin’ a killin’
When you count your first million you never forget the feelin’
That when my eyes go to twitchin’, palms start to itchin’
Niggas be snitchin’, that’s when my dogs start trippin’
Badda dat da, dadda dat dat dat

She snortin' white lines

Or may ride up on a horse 
That's what you call a fuckin' boss
I know you see and smell the smoke 
But that's the way I choose to float
But you could do just what you want
Silk shirts and gold ropes 
But how we move, stay on the low 
She wanna hit the Cali slopes

Police can smell the marijuana 
But they respectin' my persona

While she be snortin' white lines

Cartier bracelet and locket
We like to film it, then we watch it
Tell your friend come join the party 
You a freak and I'm a prophet 
Painted the Chevy doo-doo chocolate 
I drop the top and let 'em watch these livin' legends out the projects 
The coolest bitches in the party 
We got 'em fuckin' in the lobby

I'm out in Paris spendin' cream, the Eiffel Tower's on the list
Of place the missus never seen 
For Louis V, I'm still a fiend, flip a brick and make a wish 
The DNA to be a king 
Your favorite rapper facin' liens

Skinny nigga but I do it Large like a 3X
The last nigga try it...Got a question, you afraid of death?
That's the only question I got for you
Huh
Flowers on my grave, doves in the sky 
Rats in the sewer dance when I die 
Champagne in the shower, toast when I cry 
I was born to kill, livin' is a crime 
Nikes in the box until the money fill it 
Ski mask in my pocket so don't make me peel it 
Yayo in my blood, it's like I need a rush 
Head all in your system, pussies need a flush 
Choppers on the seat as I listen to Meek
Speakin' less to niggas as bodies increase
See me on your set, better check your circumference
Might end up on your back and not bein' responsive
I was forced to kill 'cause I want to live
And if you wanna buy a crib, they give you thirty years 
Me against the world, pistol in your clutch 
They like to call it freedom, it was never such 
Niggas on the porch, weed in the blunts 
You go against the team, you ain't seen in months 
Bitch nigga died, bitch niggas die 
Flowers on his grave, doves in the sky 
Pocket full of money and I need the most
I tell 'bout what you are, you niggas' needle's low 
Bitches know you broke just lookin' at your hoes 
They need some newer purses than they shit they post 
Kilo in the mornin', skip the cappuccino 
Bomb under my car like I was Al Pacino 
Flowers for a king, flowers for a king 
So, the very day I die, this song you sing 
Flowers on my grave, doves in the sky 
Rats in the sewer dance when I die 
Champagne in the shower, toast when I cry 
I was born to kill, livin' is a crime 
Nikes in the box until the money fill it 
Ski mask in my pocket so don't make me peel it 
Yayo in my blood, it's like I need a rush 
Head all in your system, pussies need a flush 
Let's go, Snow
I ain't playin' wit' 'em, no way, no how 
Got the .40 in my 'Didas sweats right now 
I'm knockin' everything down, bowl three strikes
Had to count up all the paper, took me three nights
Pray the Lord protect my soul, I'm just tryna make it 
Had to leave them niggas 'lone, they was thinkin' basic 
So many hundreds in my pocket like some Hammer pants 
Shit be funny 'til you ridin' in that ambulance 
Say my name three times, I'm the Candy Man 
So many verts outside, call it Candy Land 
Pussy nigga turned to owls, they like, "Who nigga?" 
Brought them bananas for the monkeys at the zoo, nigga 
Flowers on my grave, doves in the sky 
Rats in the sewer dance when I die 
Champagne in the shower, toast when I cry 
I was born to kill, livin' is a crime 
Nikes in the box until the money fill it 
Ski mask in my pocket so don't make me peel it 
Yayo in my blood, it's like I need a rush 
Head all in your system, pussies need a flush 
Powers of position I'm addicted to
That's what sweepin' up the block just for a nickel do
I put down nickel rocks just in the nick of time
Now that S500 Benz just circle fifty times
Hundred shots, don't make me put that .50 down *gunshot*
When that bitch go off, I bet it make a nigga proud
Walk up on you and he make a piggy sound
Then I'm back to the strip club to blow a bitch allowance
We know them niggas tellin' but we hustle harder 
I was born to kill, I pray I die a martyr 
You should die today but I'ma try tomorrow 
I always end a threat that's followed by the flowers
I just got a phone call, that boy Bo Diddley home
I bet in thirty days that boy be fifty strong
Race to get a million just the way we think
Middle of the summer in a cheetah mink 
Kilo in the mornin', skip the cappuccino 
Bomb under my car like I was Al Pacino 
Flowers for a king, flowers for a king 
So, the very day I die, this song you sing 
Flowers on my grave, doves in the sky 
Rats in the sewer dance when I die 
Champagne in the shower, toast when I cry 
I was born to kill, livin' is a crime 
Nikes in the box until the money fill it 
Ski mask in my pocket so don't make me peel it 
Yayo in my blood, it's like I need a rush

Tonight those tensions fueling violent protests now. Dramatic images coming in at this hour. You can see some people there on the streets throwing rocks and bricks at police officers
Lil homies livin' like it's no tomorrow
Caught a charge smokin' large in a stolen car
He called his mom, guess he figured she would post his bond
Times have changed and she really runnin' low on funds
Hung up the phone, in the cell still in his Foams
Reekin' of the weed, that's all his money blown
Now it's time to tell yourself, nigga, "We gon' make it"
And 15 hundred cash, nigga, we gon' make it
A free felon on their ass, nigga, we gon' make it

Put your back against the wall, nigga we gon' make it
And if you black, this for us all, nigga we gon' make it
They say we just a bunch of thugs, don't stand for nothin'
Disgrace to our race, don't belong in public
It was us against the world from the first day
Let us bow our heads, may we all pray
Throwin' bricks at the man, we gon' make it
Genocide not in the plans, we gon' make it
Pray my son understands, we gon' make it
Know God holdin' our hands, we gon' make it
No power in December, nigga we gon' make it
Stove open, I remember, nigga we gon' make it
These the words mama whispered, we gon' make it
Still holdin' on my pistol, nigga we gon' make it
I seen a lot of niggas fall, still standin' tall
And a lot of people talk you've never seen talk
When your man testify, that's a coin toss
Never trust niggas, hit 'em with a moonwalk
Billie Jean, Billie Jean, oh Billie Jean
Say a prayer for my team, we gon' make it
Hold your head to the sky, we gon' make it
All my niggas gettin' high, we gon' make it
They say we just a bunch of thugs, don't stand for nothin'
Disgrace to our race, don't belong in public

Throwin' bricks at the man, we gon' make it
Genocide not in the plans, we gon' make it
Pray my son understands, we gon' make it

If you don't bring him to justice, if you don't bring him to town square, you're gonna see all these people in your motherfuckin' neighborhoodI like my pussy a little wetter, my drinks a little colder

So fuck a diamond chain, we wearing guns on our shoulder
If you want it you can get it, come and sign up
We got choppers that will put that Tony Romo 9 up
Man we so fuck about it, 5-star: count it
Could have fucked the world, but I left it how I found it
Took the game to school now I’m 'bout to cap and gown it
Got a circle of success, you can say I’m well-rounded
Yeah, and by the way my name is Tunechi
Uptown roller, take it off your shoulder
Tommy’s with the flag, spent the hundred high-rolling
Flipped it off the condo, made it off the corner
Sky scraping condo, top floor aroma
High to the sky when I step up in this bitch
Thousand dollar cologne, no ceiling in this bitch
The marble for the Louie, the bag full of cash
Keep a strap on me, a mill on the tab
Priceless with these numbers, flipping in the seat
Junior doing time, kicking up his feet
A mill on the books, I’m stunting with a fleet
A pretty red bitch we smash every week
Blowing on some good Maybach back seat
The bitch sleeping good, a mill on the sheets
Born rich from the hood YMCMB
Yeah Maybach, brrrap!
I’m that fat motherfucker, young entrepreneurs
Zombies in the street we got them pouring out the sewers
Most controversial and the motherfucking truest
And by looking at my jewels Im still the motherfucking coolest
Waving your flag, you just a fucking blood donor
And this bitch far from bad, who put these fucking Uggs on her?
Took her to California, spent a fucking dub on her
When she walk up in the club now every fucking thug want her
I’m just so fucking special, let's see what's on the menu
Fuck the promoter, my crib bigger than the venue
This the shit I'm into, all-black in the rental
My chopper be making hits: it's such a sad instrumental

I’m building hotels off the coast of St. Croix
100 mill, I accept nothing less
Black Ray Bans at Obama’s next addressYou scared to die, nigga?
Open your eyes wide and I pray you are 
I'm out on bond so I gotta beat it 
All the dope boys say they wanna be me 
I got a lick, boy, I got a lick 
2017 trust me, boy, this one is it
I used to smoke the weed until my fingers burn 
Pool of bitches fuckin' me, I got 'em takin' turns 
My nigga bought the stick but you wanna fade 
Made runnin' in the bank a residential thing 
All my niggas mad they like, "Fuck the world" 
Back to standin’ on the Ave. with a couple birds
If you a killer, well I’m tryna see 
'Cause callin' the police the only thing free 
I had to park that purple Lamborghini​ 
And pull that Chevy back out on the cement 
I'm from the city where they kill for nothin' 
And all Renzel do is push a button

Quarterback and quarter keys, plus I own the team 
Rather you than me, rather me than you 
Riding in that coupe, hanging out shooting 
Glass panoramic top, I don't got no roof 
Your bitch wishing on a star, I can see the moon
I can count to a million with my eyes closed
And shoot a pussy with that chopper while I'm blindfolded 
Draco, Draco, Draco  fitted cap a halo 
Activis and Faygo, no pussies on my payroll

Barefoot 'cause them kids took your Adidas 
I'm keepin' fried fish up in my mama pan 
How much y'all detectives call yo' boy the son of Sam 
Sa ka fet shake up the block, that's with a hundred grand 
Put that voodoo on you niggas so that gun'll jam 
You know them niggas killers how they name ring 
You know them niggas winners how they chain swing 
All the bitches sellin' pussy charge the same thing

Money in the mansion, yayo in another spot
Guns in the attic, mama help me put 'em up

Load a hundred rounds, bring it back she'll fill it up
Like the time when them niggas payed us counterfeit
He count chips but that trick may have got 'em flip

Quarter million for the chain help the collar chill

My nigga' started having seizures when he caught his case
Then he caught his bitch cheatin', right on father's day
It's a dirty game and sometimes nigga wash your face
Haters eatin' all they got to see, 
Bang Bang, where he lay at bitches, where he stay
It make no difference if you call them people right away
Creepin' through the block, I'm looking for my man
Tryin' to show you how they do your head for twenty grand

Fresh off the jet, straight to my hood, and put it in his hand, word up
These nigga's ain't bout that life
V.S. stones when I rock that ice
Baking soda when I rock that white
I'm counting racks when that pie hit ice
Got the low, I can't top that price
But I bet they tell you that rock hit right
No rap or hip hop tonight, just white boy and her rock tonight
Rollie
All my nigga's rollin'
If I heard him telling, when I see him I expose him

She know if she fuckin' with the team, then she can't lose
Double M, G
Do it for the family
Drivin' through the Chi, top back like it's Miami
I need a billion dollars and about 9 Grammy's
And my flow heating up, I make these bitches think they tanin'

Glitz and the fame, a cocaine mortgage
In the game like Tony Parker
Snow white Range, let my partner park it
I'm back on them thangs that's my only problem
Homie I put that on my only momma
Still rollin' with the fo'-fifth
Now that I'm rich, got these broke niggas so sick
And my daughter college pre-paid
She straight, say thanks to the D game
In the Phantom on that 2Pac
Ridin' Thru The Ghetto like I'm lookin' for a new spot
I'm not, but I'm well established
I fuck with heroin because it sells the fastest
I'mma rider 'bout mine, and I wouldn't tell a lie
Take it out of town, go and get my money right

I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
If it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
A bitch try and stick me
Cause you fuck me, don't mean you can kiss me
I only fuck with the O.G.'s
The ones that won't turn you in to the police
On the run I threw a nigga fo' keys
ID's, passports it was so sweet, they lookin at me
Front yard still a car show
Bugatti, the Gotti of Morocco
I won't let the roof up
Kingdom come, Prince of Zamundah
To be loved, to be loved
Oh what a feeling for me to be loved
Haters want to murder me and I can smell a hit
So it's music to my ears every time I fill a clip
I'm a card shark up in the Hard Rock
Twenty grand a hand, favorite jam in the iPod
I'mma rider 'bout mine, and I wouldn't tell a lie
Take it out of town, go and get my money right

I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

Got me a white girl, I fuck 'til her face red
Yeah her food tastes bad, but she give me great head
Please let me say that I really love her credit
Send her to dealership and she-can ,she-can get that
My heart in the ghetto, I'm married to the projects
I ride with the AR, in case a nigga start shit
I'mma rider 'bout mine, and I wouldn't tell a lie
Take it out of town, go and get my money right
And if it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care

Chest full of ink, pussy on the sink

Mansions in the hill
Strippers at the crib, this how I live
Always wanna smoke, always on the go
They always on my page, waiting for the next post
Feds wanna know, they just wanna know
Is it really dope? Is it really dope?
All this shit can't be his, this can't be real

Maybach musicJ.U.S.T.I.C.E League
Oh, glidin' through the city to my place 
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space
 Oh, you can find me in my Maybach
Listening to shit from way back 
Oh, ah, Maybach Music
Flows mind-blowing, these niggas switching the topic
All dick-riders, your label labeled erotic
You got a couple dollars, but really it's barely modest
Couldn't sign me if you niggas was payin' homage
Playin' both side, convicted you with verdict
Play a lil' rider, come hit you up for the murder
Chains all hollow, I peeped soon as I heard it
These niggas be talkin' shooter, but quick to send they attorney
Is it really real, like Cand Lady allure?
Money overboard, the kilos washin' ashore
Pains on the boy, Versace down to the drawers
Currency come in Crypto, you know they tapin' our calls
Chariots and lofts, niggas legs crossed
Talkin' long money, but they conversation's short
New accolades with women for me to toss
They call it "the road to riches", regardless, I had to walk
Now it's too many cars, they say I live in a bubble
But I make it the point, we poppin' all through the Summer
Got the pilots and gunners, receivers, passers and punters
My pockets playin' for keeps, G's get more than what's common
I made a few mistakes, I pray I get to repent
The passion came from the pain, I'm paintin' you all my sins
Warhol, Art Basel how it's so soft
More raw till Hov cut the 'fro off
Glidin' through the city to my place 
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space
 Oh, you can find me in my Maybach
Listening to shit from way back 
Oh, ah, Maybach Music
Let's go for a ride, to where your heart desire
I put your heart in drive, I'll let you borrow mine
My feet on top the clouds, I walk a thousand miles
She got them soft pussy lips, call it cottonmouth
And I'm on autopilot, got a larger closet
I'm at target practice, you at Target shoppin'
Second-hand smoke got her vision fallin' cloudy
Her eyes get so watery, them bitches started drownin'
On the ride of a lifetime
Watch out for the rats, mice, cons and the pythons
So Triple H, my God, I'm so sky high
Comin' down from the night sky, like a lightning rod
Shine like some ice, nice fives like a kite flyin'
No strings attached, we replace it with a lifeline
Out of body feelin', out our clothes and our right mind
Baby, ride me like a bumpy road to the high rise, yeah, yeah
Glidin' through the city to my place 
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space
 You can find me in my Maybach
Listening to shit from way back 
Oh, ah, Maybach Music
Glidin' through the city to my place 
It feels like we're floatin' up in outer space
 Oh, Maybach Music
What a hell of a year, true colors exposed
Crowns on these clowns, it's like you colored they nose
We talkin' skill set or popularity polls?
When you speak truth to power, your popularity grows
Peers switch gears out of relevance of fear
When their name's not as hot as who they wanna stand near
All you niggas weird, how can you compare
When you say you been rich but we need that shit like veneers?
For every hundred thousand dollar chain I see
On a thousandaire's neck that I dare not be
Young nigga, old nigga, you all the same to me
Just one slick tweet from trending dangerously
Rare form, airborne since Clairborne
Been fly like a runway was cleared for him
White wedding, Vogue had the exclusive
Any blemish on my past was prostitution
Sit back and let them draw their own conclusions
A picture's worth a thousand words, Mr. Houston
You wonder why cocaine's up in every song?
When music fell cocaine righted every wrong
White Ferrari Bo Derek
But the inside's black, you're standin' bow-legged
Go home and go get it
Your Miami rental cars are sleeping in my garage, motherfuckers
Glidin' through the city to my place 
It feels like we're floatin up in outer space
 You can find me in my Maybach
Listening to shit from way back 
Oh, ah, Maybach Music
Glidin' through the city to my place 
It feels like we're floatin up in outer space
 Oh, Maybach MusicShorty I got more money than I ever had
But you're the only thing I need right now
You make it all so simple
You my new thing
I fuck her like an addict
She fuck me like she mad at me
But it's all cool though
I flew out the niche just last week
When I'm away she send me pics in the sheets
 all my cars, and my sneaks
Wait, let me keep this shit simple
Fuck the radio, this just a nigga tempo
Fat boy, blue jeans, and a gold watch
Started at the bottom now she rolled on top
Black Testarossa, 0-60 on the strip, she's explosive
Just got back from Dubai
Emirates live, flew in with 1.5
Never fold is the threshold
Like my mother sayin', now never let go
Hood nigga with an escroe
Bad bitch, but she special
Went home, and I prayed for an angel
Appeared in the dark, here to take away the pain too
War wounds on the big dawg
But she get the ball like it's tip off
Watch D-Wade, got two seats
Got her everything but the new Beats
Cardier wings, nigga, two seats
Nigga gettin' money like a new Meech
We the Knights of the Templar
Dirty little nigga with ten cars
This whole click another Enron
Baby girl it's time for you to get gone
There's a shoulder just to lean on
Rozay baby, and the team strongEverywhere I go
And I’m gonna represent for all the niggas that inspired me
For the niggas that put me on
Amen
Here’s a toast to the dead rappers
You got your best quotes from the dead rappers
Young niggas doing tours with their dead rappers
Sleep on it 
B.I.G., 2Pac, Big L, my nigga Pun
A lot of legends
May they live forever
Fuck a battle, we beef with niggas across the board
It gets expensive to keep the killers when out on tour
I apologize to these women, I keep on telling lies
Yes, I’m flawed, these walls will leave you traumatized
I'm not a lemon nor menace, me I just wanted fee
In the beginning the tint hid the things that I would see
Wanted degrees, not just the math – me, I couldn’t read
Put me in a ethnic group and it was full of Gs
They say I’m a scholar, but I want a key
Shawty see me in the streets, this where she want to be
Maybach is the butter, came up from the Regal
Put your hands in the sky, deliver from evil
Book me for the show and I’ll be on the next jet
Thirty sticks with me, I be getting death threats
Dead rappers be the ones they love to glorify
All these weird niggas, I've been labeled borderline
It’s more to mine, my flow should have a clothing line
Lacoste made for a boss, the label’s organized
If they’re making a dollar, my team would want a piece
From the taxis and Ubers, the vendors in the streets
Bandanas and rags, wave them for Soulja Slim
Homie did thirty and his family, no one came to see him
Headphones on, songs about a dead rapper
Lil Snupe’s in my prayers, I still can hear him laughing
Lost Boyz, Freaky Tah, we were four deep
Mac Dre, Slim Dunkin, and peace to Doe B
Peanut, ‘til I see you, boy I won’t sleep
Jam Master Jay one day I’m gon’ meet
We take from the weak, following protocol
I was given instructions, that's meant to mold a boy
Taught from day one, this is a code of honor
You worship your mother, you cherish your daughter
These lessons will come, be aggressive with some
Respect every dollar, like we’re stretching a blunt
Nothing will change, my views will remain
So much envy we garner, for these songs that we sing
Stick to the dice, skipped in the slot machines
Sixty day tours, nigga, when we get them things
Right know we’ve got the plugs, and the numbers ‘s right
You can sit at the table, that’s if you comin' right
UhFirst of all, understand that she's a master at what she does
And the fact that she's a master of what she does
And the fact that she also has a master's degree
And is mastered the ins and outs of this business
The fact that she's doing all of that and giving me brain at the same time
Is just to let you understand Mastermind
Is that your soulmate or your cellmate?
Do you fuck with him or you stuck with him?
What's a real nigga who ain't being real with ya?
What's a downass bitch that ain't still with ya?
That's a shame Keanan, Ivory Wayans
Put your best shades on, look what I became
Had to Allen I the game in my own shoes
I be steppin' over niggas, Tyrone Lou's
Oohs
From the real, that's the only crowd I hear
Smoke kush, drink Ciroc, and I call it loud and clear
Hermes outer wear, all gold Audemar
Tom Ford high-tops like you niggas where?
Them shit's beautiful, what is it? Velvet?
I fucked your bitch Froggy Style, word to Melvin
Baby boy shit, you on some maybe boy shit
Like you got it now, but it maybe your boys shit
Six, seven, Rolls Royces, maybe it's Floyd shit
Your bitch playin' games? I maybe the joy-stick
Supreme baller like, that's all I like
Straight to the source for the J's, I got all the mics
Tell me it's real
Tell me this is real, baby
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
I'm rap prominent, rap dominent, rap opulence
First cat to take rap across the continent
I get ya whacked for a stack, it's a G thing
Then throw a rack and a crack it's a G string
Cash few hundred, clack, who want it?
Bag of blue hundreds, dash 200
Dash 250, endless speed nigga
Or you near-sighted? You can't see me nigga
I'm a different speed, different league, different breed
Hit different hoes so you die from a different disease
Dopest of the illest, illest of the dopest
Fold a 2 million dollar check infront of my loafers
You get to Heaven you go ask Biggie 'bout me
Closest thing I'm rich Porter speeding in the Audi
Hot tamale, get the hoes hot without the Molly
Hoppin' out the 'Rari, bodies in the lobby
Llamas like the Dali
Chickens in the kitchen, bitches on the terrace
Never interference, praying for your parents
See me when you see me in the BM look like Erick Sermon
The most beautiful thing is I'm high as Keith Murray
Mobb Deep shook ones, know they never think about it
Glock 5, G6, take the  with the single pilot
New money, all I see is blue money
In Orlando projects new coupe money
Pipe dream, melting shorty ice cream
Tip change with the boss, you will like things
Top 3, who can top me?
Dead or alive, been that nigga, ask Foxxy!
I'm in paradise with a pair of dice
Let's get this money, mastermind, savage life
50 mil, is it really real?
We the hottest niggas, so fuck how you feel
I came a long way from country bumpkin, now I'm with the foreign
Pop top momma, even if it's snowin'
Got a bad bitch that love to suck and fuck me till I'm snorin'
Relate to bank tellers, counting money is never borin'
Over lobster, steak, shrimp and pasta on my plate
Dash on they ass, never prison on the break
I was doin' what it takes just to make a mil
But niggas smile more than ever just to show the grill
 the set
Don't make a nigga have to flex, blow a check
Naw motherfucker, that's a threat
 Buy it all, VIPin' with ya broad
Ain’t no service, where she twerkin', make it kinda hard to call
We was in it,  Beemer whips
 she was ready
My debonairness gets her the wettest
Cause nobody
Can do it like I does it
Bust a band, pop a trunk, sub thumpin' out in public
Is this real?
Black bottles
Black bottles
Black bottles
I need a black model
Black bottlesBaby we can get lifted any time of day

Suckers for love, yes, I've heard it before
Show them my hustle which is such an incredible source
Stumble through the boutiques, always watching my step
Credit Cards in my name, she swipe them, then sign them herself
Trust is a must, never letting me down
Got her selfies with Beyonce, this is Destiny Child
Won't answer my calls after I gave you my all
Before I shed a tear, I thought I'd just write you a song
Rewrite all my wrongs, or recite you a poem
Knowing you're leaving but the question is, "Where are you going?"
Baby we can get lifted any time of day
Cause the drugs get me feeling some kinda way 
Oh hell, here we go again, we did this last night

When you winning is when they wanna say she not a lady
Hold your bag in the sky, all those bitches respect it
Now run home to your nigga, make sure that head is perfected
Never seeking acceptance, reaping my blessings

Let her snort a line so she can get a buzz
She says she want a dime, I told her get a dub

He hit a bystander which didn't matter much
And then I ate that pussy like it's Captain Crunch
We cruising La Brea like we was Mexican
When it come to your hustle, exhibit excellence
Step to my clique and you'll meet the exorcist
If you're ever in debt then you'll be the deficit
In the oval office and I'm iced out
Ankle monitor beeping in the white house
Bitches screaming for me like Beyonce
Work, jumping out the gym like it's Lebron James
This other type of money even make me nervous
I'm standing out the roof, jersey Kyrie Irving
Work, work, work, work, workKilograms were the key to my success
I apologize being so discreet with my connects
Lamborghinis were figments of my imagination
Whoever figured the figures this figure would be making
Plenty cream my women pose like figurines
Whips weaving through traffic the triple black centipedes
Oh please let a nigga breathe
Dilated pupils are the seeds of a niggas greed
With 20 g's in my denim jeans
If she fucking me she lucky just to get some Chuck E. Cheese
I bust my nut and holla lucky me

Black roses for singing the saddest song
As Salamu Alaykum to paper

Orphans, fucking orphans
Born defending some nigga never been on offence

So fuck a tutor pay attention to my shooter
Fucking me today but next she be fucking Luda
We assholes with fast cars and cash flow
My last load was gift wrapped by Castro
I did it all but the blow was my specialty
Mental telepathy directly in my recipe
Ahh, 2 mill on my second home
Still stepping on a couple bricks of that methadone
I got a method for getting money like RZA do
Resurrected Big Poppa in the physical
Reincarnated the realest I'm getting revenue
10 mill borrowed from my peers in the federal
And thats several for slinging in Atlanta
But the way they dress you never knew
Thought they seen a better view
But the feds had a rat named Reginald
That put em on a pedestal the conviction was incredible
The moral of the story was
Ain't no happy ending for a thug
I think of 2Pac, I think of Biggie now
Look how they getting down, I went and bought a 50 Cal
We all go when we gotta go
My Glock hole bigger than Nicki Minaj camel toe
So let the panel know we back, the commission intact
Teflon Don in all black fulfilling contracts
I'm only here to supersede my successors
RIP Paul Castellano, Myer Lansky, Bumpy Johnson, Al Capone
T-Roger, Tookie Williams, Carlo Gambino and last but not least John Gotti
Teflon DonIn this game it's all about timin'
It's all about your movement
Ours is oyster perpetual
Swiss, so accurate
Presidential
The dirty niggas, right?
I'm smokin' to the face, I'm floatin' outer space
Hermes house shoes, gettin' straight to the cake
Hundred bottles, chicks stare, it's Aristotle
As I money launder, laundromats on every corner
Coin operated like them boys out in Vegas
Beatin' fed cases like reprimandin' these fifth graders
Skip the Phys Ed, and yoga, bipolar
Get the big bread, so focused I'm bifocal
Two women, Twin Towers, I'm hittin' sour
Second innin', grape Swishers, they Drake's bitches
But that's my nigga, share bitches, we big business
Real niggas, gettin' money, we splittin' millions
Condominiums, brick or key, fickle V
Get the thickest bitch out of King of Diamonds to tickle me
I got a lickin' fee, 68, I'm diggin' deep
Pull the yachts out, Bel Air, Virginia Key
I'm on err' tackle, errwhere, Brian Urlacher
Err dollar, underneath my girl urr mattress
I'm nice with it, nigga
MasterMind, March 4th
Streets are mine
Black bottle boys
Haha, Ciroc lifestyle
Double M
See you real soon, niggas
HahahaLacking stability in life but these hurdles consistent
Father forgive us, pray we not just another statistic
I was blessed with a wonderful sister
Never vulnerable cause she know how these niggas'll kick it
And the mom, nieces and nephews get put in position
Opportunities endless which is based on your potential
I played the music loud, drowning out the baby cries
Had a fan in my window it was 1985
Shoes untied with a snotty nose
I done viewed homicides, but that how it go'
So when I see these niggas cry, tell 'em wipe your eyes
So many shots through the night, you know a nigga died
First you hear the screams, then your hear the sirens
Then the helicopter, a life lost to violence
A life lost to violence
Bitches applaud the hustle , the recipe of a Russel
Three kidnapping charges and definitely will bust you
Balling without a bond, Def Jam's only Lebron
Come and see me for a hit and I shoot it right in your arm
Bitches been known to relapse, indoor pool number three lap
P.O. stopped by to see me, I'm cool, where that weed at?
Smoke one for the deceased, like my partner Lil Reese
Trigger man beat the case we'll deal with that in the streets
Niggas sentenced to death by a sentence in the text
You riding with your dawg, I'm sending them for your necks
My uncle wanna know if I'm still fucking with dope
Lyrics say we livin' like the movie Blow
When niggas cross me, I leave 'em in the past
Now we got so many cars, we just leave 'em on the grass
Fake shit is temporary, dick riding is just a fad
I'm stacking old money, nigga I was built to last
Got me smoking loud, drowning out the baby cries
Reminiscing, getting high, my first time was '95
I'm reminiscing, getting high, my first time was '95Legendary
Runners
You know me
Trilla
Every dollar that I count can't grow in my account
My account can't count up all my money in an hour
Cause it's comin' too fast and I'm scared it won't last
Look that white girl in her face, told her this was her last dance
God damn, speed got my heart racin'
See I don't have the nominations you can blame it on my occupation
Ceasar salad, Caesar's Palace
You not a boss little nigga cause your cheese is average
In the Benz, AK ridin' shotgun
It's a Benz cause you're broke 'til you got one
It ain't nothin' do 100 in the Maybach
Throwin' money out the roof motherfuckin' brake pads
Fast life, I live
Big cars, big cribs
Speedin'
I'm speedin'
I can't stop it's all I know
From a young'n I was taught get dough
I'm speedin' 
I'm speedin'
See people came lookin' for me, I got ghosts see the west coast
Close and up in the Le Montrose
Big money boss major
American Idol, I got fans like Fantasia
Read between the lines or yo ass like fantasia
Get hit between the eyes, he died, they can't save him
In the Porsche, I’m weavin', no coke, no coke but I’m speedin'
Starin' at the skyline, I got a million on my mind, I'm the best
And these pussy niggas runnin' out of time, Ricky Ross
I'm the chill, quarter mill for the time piece
Yeah, I a bought a wheels like deals for the dime piece
Fast life, I live
Big cars, big cribs
Speedin'
I'm speedin'
I can't stop it's all I know
From a young'n I was taught get dough
I'm speedin' 
I'm speedin'
Sittin' in the living room watching the Grammys
Wishin' that was me that was on the Grammys
All I needed was someone to get behind me, money rain on me
I was a determined lil nigga, dirty shoes and Hilfiger
Homie help me out cause this boy is a drug dealer
Now I'm flyin' high cause my gift grew wings
And now I'm flyin' down like the cool crew winds
Kells and Ross on the Hollywood scene
Red carpet and it's smellin' like green
Now foss cause I got paid off
Collabo was the hit hip-hop and R&B boss
Fast life, I live
Big cars, big cribs
Speedin'
I'm speedin'
I can't stop it's all I know
From a young'n I was taught get dough
I'm speedin' 
I'm speedin'
We fly I think somebody followin'
We hear the helipad with ya bitch
You worth fifteen million baby
Don't try to blow it all in one week
Overseas boss 
I'm a fly away on you haters
And I came up so fast, movies, endorsements, films
We own things, bossI think a nigga phone tapped
Wanna give me time for my old raps
Indict me for my own raps
I think a nigga phone tapped
I think a nigga phone tapped
If you callin' me, I think your phone tapped
My phone tapped
Got a feelin' that my phone tapped
18 nigga wildin', trafficin' with a pilot
Crazy net worth, Miami bred the tyrants
First day of trial, courtroom was silent
Till the wiretap replayed back the dialect
Had tears in my eyes as you took your oath
Sweaty palms ain’t for niggas who be touchin' dope
Aventadors, smell the Pyrex in the air
I'm dealin' raw, D-boys so debonair
In the barber shop, it's known that I can sell a pair
Count to forty-five before that man could shave his hair
Pistol underneath the apron as I'm in the chair
Raise it to my neck, I tip a hundred for the beard
I think a nigga phone tapped
Wanna give me time for my old raps
Indict me for my own raps
I think a nigga phone tapped
I think a nigga phone tapped
If you callin' me, I think your phone tapped
My phone tapped
Got a feelin' that my phone tapped
My right hand, I knew him since fourth grade
'88, afros with no fades
Fist fights, the box Chevys on blades
Chief all they gave us the rules to play
They trynna paint a picture of a hungry nigga
Another lion runnin' in the jungle with us
Told the bitches we was brothers, shared the same beeper
Introduce you to my mother, made sure you eatin'
Now you hangin' out with different people on the weekend
Quotin' different numbers nigga, like I wouldn't peep it
If it's war, here come murder, cause that come the cheapest
Call me on my sister phone, keep it on some G shit
I think a nigga phone tapped
They wanna give me time for my old raps
Indict me for my own raps
I think a nigga phone tapped
I think a nigga phone tapped
If you callin' me, I think your phone tapped
My phone tapped
Got a feelin' that my phone tapped
Niggas tellin' cause the jealous, look at what I'm wearin'
They want me in the prison when I'm just apparent
Quarter million in Atlanta, boy I had some talent
Throw a stack in Magic City, make a hater panic
305 nigga, ridin' in the Chevy
Count a half a milli in a couple seconds
Fuck two bitches then I want seconds
Richest nigga in the city, boy I broke some records
Puttin' spinners on your cars, suspendin' on the smoke
What your spendin' on your home, spendin' on the boat
Everybody watchin', everybody tellin'
When your days numbered, nigga, cherish every second
I think a nigga phone tapped
Wanna give me time for my old raps
Indict me for my own raps
I think a nigga phone tapped
I think a nigga phone tapped
If you callin' me, I think your phone tapped
My phone tapped
Got a feelin' that my phone tapped
It's like, without, you know what I'm saying?
The foundation, dawg, there can never be no legacy
And you done set the foundation beyond the media, beyond the accusations
Beyond the idol decon
You know what I'm saying?
People tend to be my new-you know what i'm saying?
And my new speakers become vision haters, dawg
So no matter what obstacles comes your way
Like I told years ago, continue to emulate the great dawg
And continue to move forward, dawg
Cuz, you know what I'm saying, cuz your legacy becomes the hood legacy
The hood legacy is part of your legacy
And all the time I get all these questions everyday, "Man, Ross from the hood? Ross this?"
Ross is official. You know what I'm saying."Ayo, Bugatti boys

Rolls Royces nigga, what else woe?
Dope dick, back seat, front seat
Since I came in the game, you niggas philosophies changed
Chasing money, Geto Boys and Underground Kingz
Wrote the rules on how to ball without a bodyguard
Learn to move or get hit with the John Gotti charge
I pray you niggas never lose a minute to a cell
Or lose your manhood in a yard, painted nails
Fairy tales of pretty bitches livin' prosperous
Your text is quoted, dead bodies never bothered us
At the park was a thing, but we skipped the swing
Very place I first seen my first triple beam
Dirty game, pillow talkin' witcha mayne
Giver her dope dick and all the things that she would say
She the one that put me up on Netflix
At the concerts I keep her on the guest list
Freaky things, sex scenes, a bowl of ice cream
My advice to her is time to trade to my team

Post memes I got the toaster and the beam on yah
Broken holes the size of a token and the barrels to smoke yah
Know it's home invasion cause his front door is still open
When I give you game, niggas better pay attention
I'm the big homie on these missions, little niggas listen
Survived the drive by but they gave you the shakes
Know you tellin', nigga, they played us the tapes
Screamin' Maybach but I came in the Wraith
Put you in the casket, now stay in your place
Where I'm from gangbang is a thing of the past
Only thing matter if you black, you getting some cash
If the groupie fuckin', then give her a pass
When she lookin' for instructions, I give her a class
Dope boy, dope car, I got the dope dick
Dope dick, the bitches love me for the dope dick

Well educated and she got the strap
On the road to riches, bitch I can rewrite the map
Still stuffin' money in a minivan

Get Rich or Die Tryin', yeah that was 50 plan
Filed the chapter 11, guess the nigga kidneys failed
Bitch so bad, she in a bidding war

Went from slice and dice pineapple and now it's pears
Addicted to this way of life, never have any care

Used to sell dope just to feed the fam
Matchbox jumping with the kilograms
I feel your pain if you from Carol City
My last name should be Carol City
Black Dollar, I wanna buy a house on every block
Build one bigger than Dolphin Stadium, young nigga watch
Captain Crabs AK shells, living your aftermath
Ain't no love, get your money or get a body bag
Hammers and vogues, 30s and lows
River City, Lake Lucerne ride clean for the deadliest hoes
Gotta represent, nigga so meet me at the mint
And if you living how I'm living, stay behind the tint
Marble floors, mink rugs and got the gold faucets
Be cautious, well known to take the weak hostage
U.S. Marshals on the way and they cut open the gates
Know we going to trial by the look on my face
Word to the pusher, nigga never kept a job
Boobie gave me game, we used to sell dope and rob

Matchbox Projects, I gave my point of view
Bomb man, two lieutenant I was appointed to
60 thousand in nickel rocks outside the Silver Fox
Duval County to Virginia, my pockets 'bout to pop
Move 'em hoe, mind your business, therefore nobody told

We met his kids fishing on the bridge
Ten years later, bumped into him, he threw me a brick

Walking home from school, always was quick to jump a nigga
Third day of school, they knew I was a thumper, nigga
My lil hitta doing 4, he caught a gun charge
Rolling boonk in Backwoods, they out of Bunche Park
Position yourself, it's timing that's coming to the hit
Caught him slippin' at Sherman’s, he tryin' to get a fit
It’s either or, baby boy, you can meet the Lord
I pray we meet again, maybe we be on one accord
Walking through the flea market, bouncing like I hit a lick
Go and open a record label just to go legit
At the car wash on 27th was a pastime
Pay for 60 keys all at once just like the last time
Word to the pusher, nigga never kept a job
Boobie gave me game, we used to sell dope and rob

Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads
Walking on Jewish marble, hand painted the ceiling
Happy Hanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feeling
Got my seats on the wood, playas giving me dap
Lyor like how I move, Warner right in my lap

The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
And before I wrap up this Port of Miami 
There's a lot of my brothers and sisters 
They wasn't here to watch this come to pass
And since I can't do shit else, I'mma say a prayer 
Amen
This was 12 years in the makin'
No side deals with satan
I'm dealin' with the Maker 
A lot of homies ask 'What's a prayer?'
A prayer is what kept me focused 12 years
A prayer is what saved me, I should've been indicted
Now my kids know Jay-Z 
A prayer is what kept me here, when them bullets cut the air
I fell and I just said a prayer
A prayer's like medicine
It will heal wounds, ask Bush veterans
Big holes in a nigga side

Tattoos for forgiveness 
I might not get it, but forgive me

Mister 305 
Wade County
Sixteen years later
We done made history
Three rings on our fingers
Pockets gettin' fatter 
Nigga we gettin' bread
I'm the son of a saint, still considered a sinner 
Three rings on his finger, yeah, that boy was a winner 
Never known as a singer but this might be a single 
Always bet on your homies, then go buy the casino 
Ball is my passion, check my stats if they askin' 
Shawty checkin' my page, she follow my fashion 
My life is a film and Gab's the lead
She's so precious to me, as the air that I breathe
Time to fuel up the jet, D-Wade jersey the drip 
Lamborghini's to match, got Guccis on the strip 
These haters beneath us as I'm lacin' my sneakers 
Season sixteen, Lamborghinis and Neimans
I'm shootin' my shot 
Every car that I cop , every record I break 
Every rock in my watch 
Every step that I take 
Still won't step no mistakes 
I'm talkin' major league, never minimum wage
So proud to be niggas , the descent of a slave 
Motorcades, silver Mercedes, so get out my way
Tangerines, still in my slippers, still twistin' up dank
Shed a tear for all my homies, Black Bo and E. Gates
Let's find a masseuse, then inspire the youth
If it's best for the hood, then let's call it a truce
My chains get tangled , these niggas be hateful 
My momma still prayin' , so really I'm grateful
I'm still here, lookin' through the window
Watchin' the days go by
Watchin' the sun rise, why don't you try?
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha
I'm still here, lookin' through the window
Watchin' the days go by
Watchin' the sun rise, why don't you try?
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha
I promise to pray for a positive fate
Had the world in your palms, but he caught him a case
Shed a tear in the court, he got boxed in the crate
Then they shipped him up North, mom just sat in a daze
The bottles on ice, the models be nice 
We call it running shoe, any problems deny
Serve him like Boris Becker, I want two hunnid Checkers
So if they wanna slow our records, it just won't affect us
Take my boys to Mecca , all my niggas blessed 
Smokin' with my dawgs, you can smell the relish
They try to give me Hell, I bet I get to Heaven
I stay away from twelve, I'm such a gifted felon
I'm seated on the floor 
She can see the loafers 
Showin' love to the season ticket holders 
Showin' love to the season ticket holders 
Showin' love to the season ticket holders 
We do this for the city, U 
The whole city
I'm still here, lookin' through the window
Watchin' the days go by
Watchin' the sun rise, why don't you try?
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha
I'm still here, lookin' through the window
Watchin' the days go by
Watchin' the sun rise, why don't you try?
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha
Man, how does it feel, dawg?
You love doin' this
How does it feel?
Shit it feel great, baby, I know  South Beach 'til I got 
I just want to know that my boy
Man listen, we put on for the city, sixteen years
Five finals, three rings, we put those trophies over here
We put on for the- shit, let me calm down
Man, let me calm down, man fuck
Don't calm down my nigga
You the mothafuckin' Mr. 305, nigga, do what you do
Nigga I got my own county
Listen, the love of the city has been crazy, man, I appreciate it all
Thanks for giving my own county
I told these niggas man, you got a beast?
I gotta cross that bridge, nigga can't play with us, man
Can't do nothing 'round here
Hey Ross, man, ain't nothin' but love, baby
Big homie, you know what it is, always
Still with the shits, three rings later thoughRun with me or run from me
The worse come to worst
It's only gonna be gunplay
Feel me nigga
I'm sittin' at the table, countin' my money
Ain't where I wanna be, but I got a few hundred
Lot of talk on the street, like a nigga crossin' me
Well it's somethin' I gotta see
Is it how chain swing? Tired of my face
Tellin' lies gettin' niggas wives tied up and raped
Similar to the mob, deeper than the rap
All you niggas gettin' robbed, all the cell phones tapped
Bullet in my head, bullet in my chest
Yeah they want a nigga dead, they envy my success
To be loved, to be loved
Oh what a feelin', 100 rounds in the drum
Niggas gettin' whacked no sympathy for the soft
Niggas snitchin', I know bitches who clippin' you dick off
I'm a boss, champagne with the steak
Pink Rosay jason, Ace by the case
Brisco line 2, young nigga what it do?

Ain't thinkin' 'bout dyin'
My niggas so street, my swishers so sweet
All this money on the table, how a nigga gon' sleep?
Speculation of my deal, it was over 10 mil
Blowin' herb, chauffeur plus a home didn't feel
Beat the case like Gotti, we the trill murder inc
I race, slip 'n slide, they arraign me in the mink
Look Ted in the eye, it's the end of the road
And the birth of Maybach, mean I'm gettin' more dough
Smellin' Christian Dior, I used to be poor
When ya cross Florida line, boy I'm your leader
Booby boys still, booby boys real
You can name a lot of lames that the booby boys killed

Suede pea coat with the Gucci trim
Knew it was him by the Gucci brim
We gotta do it B-I-G
I'm tryna hit the lottery in the V.I.P
Green leaves in my shot glass
All night, soul team, a Ciroc ad
Ain't nothin' you can tell me
I'm on her heels like I'm Jonathan Kelsey
Told her friends that she felt me
We made love through the "Love/Hate" LP
She my Josephine Baker
May need morphine, the deeper that I take her
I'm a back breaker
Another text bracket, Benz Maybach-er
Green Bay Packa

Your girl, I cut her ass just like I did today
If you dream it, live it
We young niggas living
YSL duffle, already know what's in it
I see No Limits: make em say uhh!
I see no niggas with this 100 round drum
Pullin out the club, you know I handle mine
Takin all these hatin niggas' bitches every time
Had to pop the trunk, pull out the chopper like it's magic
50 grand on my lap, poof! Like it's magic
Fishtailin' out the parkin' lot, leavin' Magic
2 bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I make the work disappear, call it magic
Sippin on the purple, any other drink magic
Voila! Magic
I'm awake ? cause I forgot to do my taxes
Called my accountant, he gonna make you do magic
? driver tell him drop me at the airport
The way y'all smoke the blunts ?
50,000 dollars on a suit, scarf and tie
KE and young Future bringing down the fireYeahhh mhmm mhmm
You know sometimes in life shit is so crazy
I wanna smoke one for my nigga peanut
That’s my brother forever nigga I love you nigga
Your son is mine nigga
Let me check this bitch right quick though
Been through a lot 9.0 times it gets cold
Doing bad had you take dope up the road
Had a situation where she kept it G as fuck
Sometimes realer then the niggas that I trust
Running in banks, walking out stores
Anything that I needed signature she would forge
Fucked up her credit overdue rental cars it was all 50/50 in this lil thing of ours
Girl used to lace me shoplifting at Macy’s
I just loved that fact that she really did embrace me
Then she started dancing really didn't faze me
Started popping pills that's when shit got crazy
Money come and go but the trill will remain
When this rap shit pop I told her that I never change
Have been stacking change and I gotcha a lil' cut
When we meet again girl we can live it up
 And no matter the time or the place in the matter the crime
It’s just me and my,  just me and my
Do it all through whatever we stay together 
 And no matter the time or the place in the matter the crime
It’s just me and my,  just me and my
Do it all through whatever we stay together 
Smokin' weed looking at your picture on the wall
I remember hittin' licks then we both hit the mall
Talkin' new kicks, Cologne, down to The Drawers
Raised like brothers but this dope game flaw
Things that I saw really made me wanna change
This a shame what 5 dollars do to niggas veins
After graduation best friends parted ways, fuck house parties
Now it’s time to get paid we were movin' white
While my niggas touchin' the H
We were still broke but money was on the way
Shit were goin' great til' my nigga caught a case
DNA matched a homicide back from '98 fucked up plans incarcerated my man
Took his Lexus Jeep Diamond Rings of his hand
Damn, but you can't take a real nigga legacy legends live forever
So my letter reads
 And no matter the time or the place in the matter the crime
It’s just me and my,  just me and my
Do it all through whatever we stay together 
 And no matter the time or the place in the matter the crime
It’s just me and my,  just me and my
Do it all through whatever we stay together Smoking and ride
And I ain’t trying to hide it
We will get high tonight
Cause I am hooked on a feeling

It’s nothing but the best straw last drop
Make you feel like you can fly
Do you do you do you do you do you
Do you wanna fly tonight?
Opa-locka airport talking G6
It’s me baby girl straight G shit
No disrespect but really you ain’t seen shit
'Til you're 40,000 feet with the weed lit
I once got a chance to fuck a stewardess
Hit her from the back flying over New Orleans
She was gorgeous name was Dolorous
Father was a lawyer mother was a florist
Rose petals turned into YSL
So ghetto but  she turned me onto Jean-Michel
Bad bitch I am talking up and down
Couple niggas she always fucked around
But the bond that we share nothing would compare
When I bought my first beamer I swear that bitch was there
Side on the line say boy a couple stacks
Down payment and even all cover the tax
It’s hard not to kill niggas
It’s a full time job not to kill niggas
Mob on
So God bless all the real niggas
So many obstacles and stress for a real nigga
Now it's on
All my haters turned to ashes
Dead and gone

It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas

Du berceau à la cellule au gros gamos véhicule
Moi je chie des putains d'euro sur mon pécule
Passe le salam au rap francais, de la part de mes testicules
J'aperçois des gouttes de sperme pendant que tu articules
Et on trouve ça bizarre alors on se dit que c'est peut-être le shiznit
Et on croit bien que tu suces des biznites
Je suis déçu, mes khos eux en étaient sûrs, en es-tu sûr ?
Hennessy pur, on the rocks guérit mes blessures
Tous les  tous les jours je taffe dur, tous les jours je galère
Tous les jours tu demandes combien y'a de zéros sur mon salaire

And every night I feel you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let go
Guilty pleasures late night, I call it innocent
Hear you play a lot of games, a couple instruments
Snapchat wars and I got her role playing
She got her own man, tell him that your phone dead
Hustle is a code ain't no limit to this dope
Invest time pen rhymes now I got it so boss
Invest into a weak woman one becomes weak
Reflection of the man truly I'm a born king
Rose from the sewers while you was in the subs
Coach show love first class now that's us
Spilling champagne you should see the smile on us
Congratulations from the ones who tried to style on us
Even though I try, I can't let go
Thoughts of you and I still kill me slow
And every night I feel you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let you go
Yes I'm single and wealthy, if you freaky then tell me
Never run from your past still photobombing your selfie
Was we ready for this move really honestly
Did you ever have the tools to really honor me
Well I fell in love and I had a great time
Now I'm back out on the streets no more face times
For the have nots I could've been a mascot
A limit timid with these women on my cash route
Counting paper in the ghetto underneath my rag top
Money come and go exception is my stash spot
Black bag black dollar on the black market

Most gangstas choose to die violent
Diamond'd up Eagle G, diesel weed slingin' needles
Heroin drawn from my cerebral
Paint artist, lace you with scars, and tarnish everythin' on you
Take you out your jewels, now undress
New York savages, hunt scavenges
Son, get his address, mac and a Jag, the nigga asked for this
Play low, my killas, they say go
Catch him in snake mode, bite him, then jump in a gray boat
Dope verse fresh in the blow store, comin' out heat first
So when we meet, it's a deep thirst
Winners take winners, we invest
Keep it on the up and up, just like Khaled, we the best, nigga

Scare snakes out the grass when the tree spark
Backwoods, no white boys
Movin' white? Better look out for them white boys

Went from sellin' dope so now I'm into art
Hangin' on a nigga wall, I see a brainwash
Fuck a Rolls Royce, I went and bought a Basquiat
Andy Warhols all throughout my mamma house
Burn, burn, they wanna see you burn

Lets call us some bitches and have a good time
A lot of bottles of Vodka as we forget time
Lets clean up the Chevy so we can ride by
Quick piece of pussy call it a drive by
I'mma slide by sipping on that high life
And my slippers jack triple where my five light
As a all-star I made so many highlights
Touchdown field goal this my night
She the wild type ready for the wild night
Are you the bi type hanging at the bar type
I hope you are cause that mean a player all right
Smokin like a Taylor so the paper is all white
Tryna to land a plane baby are you really game
Back to the future me and Wiz got this thing saying
I stay high while ya'll stay low
Tryna tell me bout the smell I know
My eyes stay red from all that smoke
The weeds with me everywhere I go
And ya'll can't roll, woah woah woah woah woah woah woah oh oh oh
I got yo girl digging all in my ash tray
Dicking her down for the few past days
She asked the name of my sneakers, are they designer
Shawty green as the reefer even the grinder
Fucking like its a porn in my recliner
Looking straight in the eyes, they show vagina
She's a liar but damn she does it well
We on fire imagine what it'll sell
All my homies are people that I admire
Small clique of real niggas smoking that fire
Holding my dick until the day that I expire
We and Wiz in the Benz getting higher
I'm in the right pair of Nike Airs
From gravel to marble I travel light years
I'm like chyea I'mma chill right chea
Like the Mack 11 on me nigga no fear
Skateboard aboard to PanAmerica
I make more abroad than in America
Waiting for the day Bob rose from the dead
In HD as I take an ounce to the headI'm just doin' my job, I'm just doin' my job heee

Got me Malcolm X, Student of Elijah
All these bitches wet as I'm walking through the fire
I spoke about a pill now they wanna boycott
When they favorite pastors, turning boys out
I'm mad at my leaders, cause they all blinded
Look at all these brothers that I'm feeding, niggas shining
Criticize the culture, cause they can't control it

12 years old and you dealin' crack
Your momma only 26 - how she deal with that?
Got a deadbeat dad, but he far from dead
He never knew chocolate milk make you fart real bad 
One thing that I wish I could change
Just to see my daddy wavin' at a football game
Just to see my daddy standin' when they say my name
Walk me to the locker room and say, "Son, good game!" 
You make a tackle, but nobody there to clap
So I'm writing down my feelings, never knew it was a rap
Our house burnt down, we livin' in motels
So no matters how it sound, let me give you the whole tale!
Goddamn! Now the tears won't stop!
Momma held down three jobs, can she live on top?

But I perfected, what I had to work with
Trunk full of sack, saying my prayers
Let me cut the music down so The Lord can hear!
Psalm 27, ink tatted in my arm
Made me think back, when I was baggin' up a bong
Young D-Boys always bragging about the run
I was on my third Rolley - now, I guess we're the bomb!
Now it's deep cuts in the club for the watch
Might let two dimes just fuck while I'll watch!
I'm a Delano, it's Tony Soprano

My livestyle get busy,  you niggas really rare
Put my bitches on, get money, stay out the trap
Fuck 'em long, smoke a bong maybe go get a tat
No illusion, quarter millie for this whip I'm cruzin'
Caught a deal, hop a plane with Hov and I kept it movin'
Mob ties, Santeria, protect me from these shooters
Nice suits, so religious, these muthafuckers ruthless
Blonde broads, Cuban cigars, shit I get the true
Lucky suit, VIP, Double M, T.I. truth
Cap guns, stab wounds, they think we having fun
Doing shows, fucking hoes, Gunplay's still on the run
I do this for us
Stuck on the grind trying to elevate
I'ma stand as a man never above ya
Some niggas choke, Some niggas don't
That, da-that, da-that, that, the last ganstas
Pissing in portable potties out at the public school
Late to class, walk the halls then wanna run with tools
Say your name, what's your gang, my people wrote the rule
4th of July, light up the sky, step on my shoes
All I do is feed niggas and they call it food
That's my fool, I assume you know he in the room
You hear the boom, soul floating like a balloon
Fatal wound, if war niggas yell "I played the rules"
A lot of goons, cocaine bitches consume
Still fill the room, King of Diamond, go get the broom
Dreamchasers you fuck with Meek, you gotta fuck with Coon
Them my poon, they DC, carve it in my tomb

Fast whips, G wagon that's horse and carriage
Marriage is not for me I'm rich and careless
Ex-ex relax your under my mattress

8 mile, a while my shit was stagnant
Seven fifties do '8' figures, young nigga at it
Ho wow, ho now, they think it's magic

Mink drapes, Prince cape and on my talon
The parallel, twist one for Khaled
I do this for us

All black all my cars I call them Amistad
My Masonic Lodge the second nation under God
I'mma kamikaze for my brothers common cause
You can get this shit bagged with this llama in my drawls
Hallelujah, women holler, somebody plotting
Got 'em leaking holes in his medulla oblongata
I never passify pessimist
Pastors lie is my testament
The past of the present tense
They nailed Jesus to the cross
My jeweler nailed a piece 30 g's for me to floss
Lord forgive me I'm a sinner
Still smoking Bible paper Revelations getting thinner
760 Beamer, smelling like a winner
Four piece chicken box Birdman dinner
Swerving thorough the streets it's the KGB
Kool G's back nigga MMG, Ross
Live from New York, kid kind of short
Knock down towers the big toe the torch
Rap legend from Queens with the South Beach Boss
Pumping Maybach Music getting mouthpieced off
The cost of jewlery had seen what a house lease cost
In these foul streets we floss to the North of Miami, connect
The more we came it's still sandy and wet
It's the lazy eyed gangsta kid G. Giancana
That'll walk into your floor sick the piece straight behind ya

I see the warm Tod loafers
I see the crisp cashmere socks
And I know that today is going to be a good day
A hundred dollars a sock
{Laughs}
Two ankles, you do the math

Socks on the first, followed by the loafers

Well known as the boss, it's the bottle popping
Talking down, she wanna ball like Cyndi Lauper

Let a nigga gang bang in the found blue 
Red beamer and it's brand new
So shout out to the bitches we done ran through
True connoisseur carnivores, to the whores

Speeding in my fast car, reminiscing on the girl that I last saw
And how she cut wood like a hacksaw, wax on wax off man that ass soft
Attached to my fitted, but I get that kitten hat soft
I was jimmy hat strapped when I fell up in that cat: pause
All over my body, me on for my yoning balls had the head down
Tails up like a coin toss rolling up a body
Stretching like Pilate, 110 Maserati
Burning down the highway, burning on some Marley
Could this be love infatuation of the body?
The facts is that I'm sloppy with my feelings and it's got me
Chasing love at six in the morning, horny as a dog in heat chasing after pony
The streets is lonely, but it's just me and the stars
Me and my thoughts, could it be me and the Goddess?
Well if I play my cards right, tarot cards on my dashboard if they re-write
Or leave me right back to my queen tonight, right?

Custom cars and cycles tight, bitch I ain’t need none of them features

You know a lot of times people misinterpret it, as far as the Carol City Cartel
The Matchbox and think it was just violence
It wasn't never about violence, it was all about survival and gettin' that position
So now, you know this the platform we had to use - this call is from a federal prison -
Now dudes get in position and we love that position because we love to win
And we gonna continue to win, as long as we breathin'
You know what I'm sayin'? And our kids gon' win, and they kids gon' win because this what its bout'
You know what I mean?
So you already know fam, the big homie, its just, you know what I'm sayin', a product of his environment
Who used his environment to get in position and if a person don't like that
Then they don't like success dog
Because, you know, we ain't gon' never stop
You know, and thats what I like about Rick Ross and all his music - beep beep - picture with words
Tell everybody I send my love man, and Carol City, Matchbox, for live dog. Carol City Cartel too, you hear me?

TrillaThey say money is power
And if that's the case, we got millions of power
With kush and lean on my breath
Let's go underground on these commericial niggas man
Bawse!
Yeah, 16, I caught my first coke case
Crackers jumped out, ransacked my folks' place
Took me to Dade County for a short stay
It was somethin' small, but chickens was my forte
Lord forgive me for my sin but I have to serve 
Starin' out of a Benz is what I deserve
When every nigga that you know got a felony
How will I every get to grow into that better me
That's why we all broke, that's what you tellin' me?
Momma go to church and shit's so far from heavenly 
Let me tell you about the last beef
Ak-47 seven times seven feet
Gave that bitch a bloodbath
Shit is organized, you gotta bring them drugs back
And what made it worse, the killer was fuckin' his sister
Brother was the victim, she fell in love with a villain
Pretty cars, I slept with pistols all under the pillow
Shotty all in the kitchen, heard over a bowl of cereal
This deeper than rap
I guess a box of Cap'n Crunch get you deeper than that
I got thirty ounces in my shoe box
I'm on 2 pills and think I'm hearin' 2pac
And I'm so rich, bitch, I could get high
Once everythin paid off I could just die
I always had a plan to let your grand wizard
Send trembles through the land when that man whisper
Go on, sacrifice your sister, let the boys flip her
This is deeper than rap and I still keep it trilla
This deeper than rap

Geechi Liberace in the building
Ray Charles on the flute
Ahh
Sway wallabies, I follow policies
Always give her game every time she swallow me
Shootin' blanks, but you gotta hit the chart at least
Seen a lot of young MCs even die for peace
Niggas posting pictures while I'm posted in Belize
Spent those lonely rainy nights just praying on my knees
Being overseas is a daily routine
Young niggas traveling the world, that's just been in our genes
Put the gang together, now you niggas traumatized
Kilos and koofis, King Tut during Ramadan
Scramble like I'm #9 during the summertime
Doubling back #1, I'm doubling back around
Drop DC4 then shut Atlantic down
8 figure nigga, tell me how those numbers sound
Hit the Bay and let Berner know that I want a pound
In LA, get the Bentley truck just to run around
305 nigga 'til they gun me down
Little kids in the streets gotta come in the house
When the shots ring, even cops pause
Niggas full of bullet holes which is not boss
Funny how a rich nigga was so poor at math
Make it rain, shorty, better throw it back
It's leather , 80 bands
Middle of the floor, time for the money dance
It's a time for politics and it's a time to kill
Fast break and we coming like the Cavaliers
I could turn a nigga city to a battlefield
And my biggest flaw really was my lack of fear
Big Ducky in Fruit Town, he 2000
Tony  in H-Town with the coupes out
These my niggas on call and we bring the suits out
Pool party, it's popping like Uncle Luke house
Fake niggas, it's time that we pull ya skirts up
At the table and pussy niggas ain't worth nothing
Couple shooters gotta keep 'em in a  line
Nothing really than  still alive
Niggas body dropping like a holocaust
The glory of war really your mama loss
First time all your kids got to play together
Holding hands, bow our heads, let us pray together
Funny how a rich nigga was so poor at math
Make it rain, shorty, better throw it back
It's leather bed  80 bands
Middle of the floor, time for the money dance
I cut off some more friends and family members
Hope they know I'm the raw nigga, a cold villain
Haters still hating 50 million later
I'mma tell you like a player, better get some paper
Still can't believe it all as I walk my halls
Rarely speak to these niggas screaming, "Free my dogs"
Little homie didn't rob, but he took the charge
Dade County niggas still behind them barsLord forgive me for my sins
May we all join hands
M-M-M-Maybach Music
Meetin' up with Cubans on the boat
Talkin' all white like the pope
Type of money bring Bill Cosby back
A different world, nothin' for my college cats
I respect you niggas buildin' all the apps
But it's time we raise the ceilings in the traps
Maserati let the sprinkler get 'em wet
All the yayo guaranteed or you can send 'em back
Wanted perico, started poquito
Callin' my chico, call me Gordito
Beefin' with these niggas just to gun 'em down
Had to milk the game, I got a hundred cows
Can't be livin' foul when you takin' vows
Gave these niggas game so he like my child
Havin' everything to gain,  trial
Prosecutor, cocaine, tryna lock you down
Only Black with a Mustang on the block
Talkin' sack when them boats came on the dock
Look at how I live, I barely sold records
Look at what I build, I own the most Checkers
Bodies on the slab, livin' on a limb
A product of the bad bitch is really him
I get the type of money give me night sweats
I got so many cars, where the titles at?
If you think a nigga lyin', where the Bible at?
I'd sell my soul just to bring my homies back
They gave my niggas life, told 'em it's a wrap
So I penned my nigga life, told him it's a wrap
Port of Miami 2
M-M-M-Maybach MusicYou only get one life
That's enough if you do it right
Opinions don't phase me
Your hate ain't gonna change me, no
But I ain't gotta explain myself to nobody
The swag non-stop, the paper won't quit
Yet it's fly nigga, how she wanna skate on my dick
The all black drapes, hollow wall full of safes
My gas on fleek, jet fuel for the weak
These niggas wanna tweet, my niggas wanna eat
Down south dope boy, D-boy, nigga eat
All red Yeezy's, women who be on TV
Guaps in the marble, only all down these zee-zigs
Tellin' jokes, blowin' smoke, the finest artichokes
Fine dishes, pretty bitches on our ghost spokes
I'm tipping through on my shorty, eyes look Tiffany blue
Methodous flows killing these niggas, christians approved
Very wild, no photos, these niggas rarely smile
Only problem is staying low while the paper pile
Scared to come to town, really? How you niggas sound
I get my bitch to come pick you up, just to gun you down
You only get one life
That's enough if you do it right
Opinions don't phase me
Your hate ain't gonna change me, no
But I ain't gotta explain myself to nobody
Fame is a flaw, I give the game to you raw
Number one in the south, she can see that from afar
She can tell by the car, double R on the plate
Rolls Royce over those black market bumping in the rave
Bitch nigga with poor taste, starve while y'all ate
I put my niggas on, they got 20 more on the weight
We all gotta die so that's double M to the day
I know the devil try so I get on my knees and pray
Jesus still walks, we marchin' in a parade
Black and white holding hands
While letting that thing blaze
Pistol on my waist, I can feel a police chase
Homie cutting crack like home made cheese cake
I get right, I get it right, I double back, I get it right
We make mistakes, but baby now is the time to get it right
I see you on that Jeep, but really what you living like
You only get one life
That's enough if you do it right
Opinions don't phase me
Your hate ain't gonna change me, no
But I ain't gotta explain myself to nobody
My heart nickle plated, these haters they all hating
Hate to see me smile, hate to know I made it
Hate to see me toast with my niggas, I'm motivated
Hate to see me with these women at these publications
I still get it poppin', let me get them keys
I still do the proper, do the BET's
I still roll it proper, let my niggas feast
Still in that 'rarri blowing hella weed
I'm doing big things, I got big dreams
Move out of my way, if you ain't for me
Feel like a winter, I put in work
So many years, man I deserve to be celebrated on every level
If you can't take it, that's your problem
I'm gonna thrive, I'm gonna shine
I'm gonna live my life
You only get one life
That's enough if you do it right
Opinions don't phase me
Your hate ain't gonna change me, no
But I ain't gotta explain myself to nobodyAnd I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young

She told me, "Don't worry no more"

Black Market on the way the world ready for it
Met ball we the only ones that can't ignore it
Beanie Sigel with eagle ducking several warrants
Running through the lobby party at the Gansevoort
Garden of Eden grew into enchanted forests
In the city where the get it was the mandatory
She had a thing for Adam and Eve
Say a prayer every time my Jesus piece swing
It got deep when it got deep
She never slept when I got sleep
She ran the streets like Meryl Streep
Beastie Boys on college in the red jeep
Dripped in all white like im Pope Francis
Know she see me calling but she won't answer
Party on the weekend
And we can take them on the deep end

Told her I would cop her all designer gear
Straight to the mall when the wire clear
LA Reid and Steel calling back to back
20 mil, new deal and that's after tax
Can't rap with a nigga who ain't got a rap
It ain't trap music if you never had to trap
Don't ask 'bout it if you can't handle the facts
My whole rap style built for the counter attacks
The late night walks on the beach though
Fuck her, legs in the air, I’m licking each toe
Bread sticks, she want the sushi with the Miso Soup
Glass of Bel-Air Rose, I keep the weed rolled
Chauffeurs always told to use the key code
Parked outside, the condo look like a casino
She ask what I use for the sex drive

Stories commonly echo throughout the battlefield
Familiar faces fire from inside a Cavalier
Where were you when we squadded up to retaliate
Pardon my French, German Ruger inside the Palisades
Sun seekers and , let's have a yacht parade
200 feet too long for the Feds to come confiscate
In the mall I make her smile like Arsenio Hall
Front or back I fuck her raw while accepting my calls
When in right or wrong, still I'm reciting my songs
Kid dynamite, this why they call me the bomb
Took another date, landed in another state
This a lot of raw dishes on my dinner plate
No squid, no crab, all I want is fish
At the wedding I got married singing reminisce
Body guard, fuck you and that body guard
Make 'em come pick up a body 'fore the party start
Ferrari fat boy, they fuck with me on snap chat
I get the party, started fuck her sliding out the back
Her favorite show is How To Get Away With Murder

I was at the six deuce, waiting for the Maybach
Cooking up two in a cue, just so I can make back
Looking for my fortune in a pot, Pat Sajak
Now I’m in the back seat, beach chair, laid back
Play cloths brought a million to my door
Yeah that baby’s mine, every rapper’s beggin' for her
Life as I know it is penthouses and pitfalls
More jealous drivers and fed time, collect calls
They took the family in '09, let’s slow grind
When the time is given we’ll unveil the gold mine
Till the casket drops, it’s show time!

I've never seen such a spread like the luncheon provided by Wing Stop
So delicious and we thank you
Never have I seen such beautiful titties hanging out at a Bar Mitzvah service before

Ain't hearin' the sirens, but I'm seeing the sirens
Ain't seein' the sirens, why am I being so violent?
That's in the nature of being a nigga
Bein' beat down, then able to get up
Bein' let down, then able to sit up

Block told me once, "Ross, this is God's plan"
I'm like "Aw, man", a man run a label like "Amen"

On the top floor and I'm the biggest earnin' now 
Shittin' on these niggas, Tweet, see 'em in the streets
I'm only talkin' money so we rarely speak

Now she climbin' out the deck, fuckin' with a thug
Had my skully on when I fuck her in the tub
Dirty money, buy Chevys, only one I love
She love it how I'm livin', such a wise decision

Sippin' on that Remy outside of the club

Chickens pullin' on my shirt, I'm just worried about the chains
Tattoos cover 80 percent of the Don's frame
Cancel it and unless I debut LeBron James
Came back Mike Vick, I buried ya dog brains
Y'all ducks want the birds, if not just keep walkin'
Got the top down and I'm feelin' like Steve Austin
You know the routine, still movin' a few things
Rollin' on two beans in them new blue jeans
I'm talkin' Japanese Denim, money stuffed in 'em
Got the coolest of the cars and the baddest of the women
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
Hey, I'mma work it on the corner, work it on the block
Work it 'til they love me, baby work it 'til it's hot
All I have in this world, all I have in this world

Never sold my 9,000 square foot house 
I got 'bout three mansions in the south 
I can make the booger sugar bounce 
I used to have the sack in the droughts 
More hop than a kangaroo pouch 
I think I might franchise a Ralph's 
Or a Whole Foods or a Sprout's 
Loyal to my soil like a spouse 
My diamonds twinkling, her pussy tingling

I'ma make me a billi and go buy back the Bronx
Feds follow my cars, call me a person of interest
The Lord is my witness that I had perfect intentions
God is the greatest, he keeps me under surveillance
Powerful statements with such a wonderful cadence
The housing was public, my mother's love was amazing
Neighborhood violence had doubled
Never complained to the mayor
Trash on the corner be in the bundles contagious
And all the blunts I be blowin' while on out on the bodega
Business endeavors, we killers forever
I need D's to the land, I plan to build a few levels
All the homes that I own, I open my doors
For ones that I call my own, I pray you do it with yours

In the one that I drive  I had to pay the cost

All my homies call of duty fuck callin' for peace

Gangsta, I’m muthafuckin’ Albert Anastasia/
Michael Corleone, presidential Rolly on/
Net worth unknown, closet full of Skull and Bones/
Silver spurs come his and hers, just live and learn/
Snipers on the roofs like troops, that’s for whom it concerns/
Applaud the whores abroad, awaiting my return/
Ressurected like Makaveli, pray my soul burns/
Sole supplier for cocaine in Southern states/
Sending sack city to city, back in a couple days/
Don’t get me started, I make triple in fickle markets
My profit margin’ll have all you local niggas starving
One time for the niggas who huggin’ the block/
Two times for the boys who bubblin’ rock/
Three times for my borhters who reachin’ the wealth/

I love you dadddddy
I love you babbbby!
I love you dadddddy!
Whooooo!
Whooooo!Regardless of how it goes down, life goes on, am I right?
Am I right? Am I right?
Just the way I've conditioned my mindset
For me to stand position well, I can survive
Living a life of crime is nothing you should glamorize
When seeing your mother smile you had to fantasize
But now it's jellyfish in all the fish tanks
So rich, think what's on a nigga wrist fake
Ain't Jewish, thank jewelers for Frank Muellers
Tenth grade,  Mac 11s, they ain't schoolers
Taught us to think foolish, degrade women
Call all the bitches hoes, still amazed with them
Corner educated, codeine medicated
Every night we celebrated cause we elevated
I am Michael Tyson, Robin Givens in the wind
She knocking at the door, don't let that devil in
Ordered her room service, caviar and cannabis
She ordered the nose candy with the candles lit
Am laid back, status of a Corleone
Screaming Maybach with my Yellow Rollie on
All my watches designer, all my women designer
Simple gifts from the Gods, I pray you all pray for survival
Smiling in your face, Mac 11 on his waist
Make or break your day better, say your amazing grace
Now you beefing with motherfuckers you never heard of
It's just another hurdle, they wanna see you murdered
Or back to flippin' burgers, better bust your burners
Say my amazing grace, before they reach they a verdict
Hey hells kitchen burning me a bell pepper
Minus the lady, P.I. 80 cuz it smells better
Say my amazing grace, she says it's just a phase
Unless it's sustained, am not in this for fame
Minus the hoe shit, the most 'emo-shit'
Versace, Neils, 60 mils selling blow shit
Coudn't make a layer, labelled a brick layer
Pull up at the park in the six, player
Six speed all the fares they can follow
Am at the Delano, ﻿where my model mulatto
Turn the strip club into an arcade
For a coin you could play dem broads, broad day
Get them junkies blowing before I master Donkey Kong
Shit was funny till I started bringing money home
Still think it's a game, aim at your high score
Call it a rap beef, bitch I'm down to die for it
 
All my watches designer
All my women designer
They wanna see you murdered
Better bust your burner
That's all I know, got a feeling
100 million up, that's the realestI've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending
And thats all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your hear
I shed tears cause im told that they'll heal
You tell the truth I don't know how to feel
Ever felt alone in a room full of friends?
Got big plans but you leave em in suspense
Pray for me, patience wait for me
Pay dues, trust me they ain't comin
Way back it was hoops, now its maybach coups
And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops
Now we lookin at each other, sittin in a court room
I'm laughin, cause its lookin like a cartoon
Never snitch, got it tattooed by kartoo?
 by my rules we all lose
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control
You got it down, and your well on your way to the top
But there is something you forgot
Flippin through magazines, ridiculed for my life
But they keep takin pictures of my jewells in the light
100g's in the night, entertainin big timers
'Cause my 1 liners rude like don imus
Smellin ros on my breath, ex ? fell asleep in his bed
Habits we developed livin lavish stackin mail up
Clothes come from big n tall ?
Got live life, tryna live life
Penthouse for a pimp, only drove the benz twice
Convertible to the cars, cause I murdered all of ours
Get 50 collect calls from dawgs behind bars
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying
To keep it under control
You got it down
And your well on your way to the top
But theres something you forgot
Fortune n fame are pleasures you couldn't fathem
But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace
Benjamins by the pallet, im spendin em mighty daily
I know I'm under sureveillance 
Millions a gotta manage, lil talents up in the rappin
Im such a threat to these n*ggaz 
I started without a coin, not knowin which way im goin
Now im chowderin ?, n readin em a few poems
Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light
I never felt this way bout anythin in my life
Determined to be the best, not lookin back at regrets
How many people you blessed is how you measure success
I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heartThis what I'm talkin' 'bout right here

Bitch I'mma ride, bitch I'mma die
When I holla 3-0-5, bitch, that's on my life

The grenades down the street, you gotta git it how you live 
I know niggas turn 1 into 2 and they do what they do

In case they came when they inhale

When I park it, I can see ya bitch heart-beat
So roll out the red carpet, roll up the purple shit
Black navigator flew
Gotta shut ya fuckin' mouth, don't ever take the smooth
Thinkin' of a greater way, to build a greater flow
I hope she got some great head, that's how I grade a hoe
White Beamer in the hood shinin' like a star
Look this half a ki' go to the club and I'mma buy the bar
Do it twice a week fuckin' bitches on the other nights

Well acquainted with Audemars and all that shit
It's Ricky Ross the rich boss
Wet bars on the boat, what broad won't elope
Crib like Scott Storch all from the coke
Maybachs were a dream now it's all real
It's hard to get sleep layin' next to five mil
Still got the chills, I call 'em the goosebumps
Yeah Alexander vision, I'm buildin' like two Trumps
Steppin' guce bumps I'm the main event
We got a pocket full of game, brain it made me ten
Six bitches' numbers all on the same napkin
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
You see it these niggas livin' of the past
I ran a hundred miles but I did it all with class
Hands all glass, wrist all glass
Mirror on the wall, how long will the crystal last
Champagne pours, celebrate the cause
Hover above the laws at the mercy of the Lord
This me nigga, It's me nigga

All the time with a sister like Gina
Beauty salon dream, got the keys and the Beamer
On the way to cheetahs pointin' an army
Land my spaceship with the spoilers only
Seen the UFOs, FBI, ATF, let ‘em know how a nigga ride

Lamborghinis and Maseratis for mediocres
When the beat's over, back to the street, soldier

We eats but we try to reach each quota
No soda, Rolls roller one on her
Rodeo eighty gram, one coda
Louis Vuitton, bright sides don’t want ‘em

Better take a picture, this is history nigga
I'm busy gettin' money, you can miss me niggaMy Guy Mars
Hey, they say ignorance is bliss, huh? I guess niggas is so blissful
Do anything for dollars, the thought of havin' a fistful
Make ‘em switch sides when it lookin' grim and dismal
A coward dies a thousand deaths, no pistol
See fuck niggas do fuck shit ‘cause they got fucked up intentions to
Nigga got no principles, better watch who you listen to
I see it in your eyes, you weak, the lies you speak
And shit you do right now, where I'm from, you die in the streets
‘Cause, boy, that ho shit
I'm in the game, I ain't worried what the coach said
And, boy, you lame, better watch how you approach that
All in your feelings, showin' all of your emotions
I'ma be at your neck, about that ho shit
All the drama, I love it, gеt an erection for it
Like go to Vеgas, fight police, not get arrested for it
The smoke, I'm runnin' to it, trouble wouldn't dare avoid
And, hell, they blow it in your direction, you better be ready for it
Right, you're humble, arrogant, oxymoron, anomaly
Egotistical activist, master solution strategist
Full-time family man, part-time politic
Trap nigga, fashion icon, I'm all of it
Don't crucify the messenger
'Cause the message real, you need to hear it
Absorb and let it sizzle in your spirit
To all these niggas goin' out sad, actin' all weird
You embarrassin' yourself, lookie here, nigga
Oh no, niggas don't respect the code 
Oh no, act like bitches, niggas act like hoes 
Catch insomnia, boy, don't you sleep

But since I can't, I'ma count this paper in front of you and
Shower you with these gifts and 
I'ma tell you the best shit that come to my mind and 
I want you to feel like I love you, baby

Drop the top and call the models, yes, all the tall type
Belaire bottles back in Beverly Hills, we balled out
Biggest boss, I'm poppin' dollars, fuck what you talkin' ‘bout
Hundred racks and no Cadillacs, now pull your cars out

Pussy on demand like I'm paying for a cable
Told that bitch this a mob ain't no motherfuckin' label
Tryin' put a hundred grand in the middle of my palm
I do it for my niggas who can't even get a pawn
Big dope dealer with a death sentence
Ain't snitch, kept it real that's real nigga
Side bitches still trippin' tryin' kill you winner
Got 99 problems, pussy ain't issue
And I'm strapped; what's a pussy nigga would tryin' play

Not nothing of these fuck
Coming up a nigga had to fight for erything
Now I'm at the fight 3 rows from the ring
Call some don king,.. jay z
Looking at this picture, bitch better say cheese
Who shine like boss, a Birdman junior
We still got birds, don't let Birdman fool ya
We just so blessed, Lexus stretched
Tears in my eyes and I mean
The fam so trill, we just so rich
You could fuck my bitch, let me fuck your bitch
Sacks in the attic, ciroc on the yachts
Knots in the pockets, baleys, no socks
Cash is a heavy, monkey on my back
So I'm riding with my dog, with the chicken on my lap
Fascinated with the shine, get high off the H
Call you when I come down
Young gutter, been running for 10 summers
Bad bitches lust, you pay for pussy, they front us
Young boss talking, you lil niggas is runners
The deals that I'm aching to turn, my gun is the stunnest
It's lies that you speak, the truth lies in numbers
The wheels on the new coupe, humongous
Bet that, maybach wet black
Curtains close on the motherfucker when I sit back
Yeah, got the game from the stunner man
Yeah, but I still keep it gutter man
Money wrapped up in a rubber band
Give it to my bitch, tell her blow a lane nothing down
Just a young nigga shitting, dumping
Maybach music in the maybach bumping
Gt vodka got me feeling right
Just a young nigga getting money man I'm living right
Oh you lil fresh lil fly like that nigga, H
Rest in peace to the rest in peace, nigga
Come through nigga when I came through shooting
Niggas popping off so I had to shoot him
Shot him up, pop it off, that's how we do it
Got the money moved out and that's how we do it
Ak, I'm in the hallway, you niggas get sprayed
You niggas can't fade, get laid
A nigga get flayed
Fuck a nigga when we land, man we wet
Chop em all then we chopped up
Chopped up, got other niggas chopped up
Upstate nigga came together got bucked
Ain't nothing came so we did it, so we did us
Another night in the new bus
Smoke till we see dust
Another bitch and she on us
Ball till we can't flush
This that H experience
This the volume one, lost tapes
These records was recorded years ago
Bitch we make time this music
Catch up, we hustlers
We winners, we rich, we the greatest
We the best, bitch we the business
We made it, we will never stop
Birdman, Ricky Rozay
Miami, new Orleans, every ghetto across the world
Every hood, every project
You feel the pain in the music
We out here, HRight now it feels like is me against the world 
Honestly, like am by myself, you know am saying?
Pity you pussy niggas flying on my down for
Never satisfying until them things going off
G-Q's best dress niggas of di year
Need to yell out the state, how they volunteer
Caught in traffic, but they never caught me slipping in it
You bitch, your nother mistress nigga, but don't get offended
The beef dead, now am moving on to bigger business
Bullet holes in your bust, but who benefit'n
The first song I wrote I did it whipping in the kitchen
Soon as you get the pretty cars, then you come in killing
Take your soul, then they sell it on the black market
Lost walking silk road, just another talking
Award, tours, but the tribe still on a  quest
Put out your cigarettes nigga when we be on the set
Heart of a soldier so, go tell your management
I have us bowing heads niggas with the candles lit
Call﻿ Adele a couples times, I got the voice mail
But you being on a line, I get a boy chills
Sitting in a corner by myself I hear the voice clip
Cross the Queens bridge, nigga bout a fourth gear
Box on my ankle,  every night I plug it up
Asking my lawyer, possibly could they be bugging us
Never envy an artist as they reach their pinnacle
Motivation came from everything we do
Walk away from a scholarship and I bought a brick
Everybody bet against me cause they thought I'd miss
Bet they right back on my dick, I say December 5th
Bet they right back on my dick, I say December 5th
Bet they right back on my dick, I say December 5th
Bet they right back on my dick, I say December 5th
Bet they right back on my dick, I say December 5th
Bet they right back on my dick, I say December 5th

Riding in the wave, niggas staring at the rear view
I got a hundred mill to pill through
You ain't fucking with devil, I can’t feel you

Money, women and drugs, that’s all these niggas talk

Clangs man, cops, these cowards tryna kill us off
Homes of fatherless sons tryna fill that void
They screaming for help but the trap always kill that noise
They whipping and na-na, they whipping together yeh yeah
They think over the stove is how you whip up a pay day
So they talk
Money, women and drugs, that’s all these niggas talk
Ain’t these fans are concern bout what they nigga bought
But in another herd, a 14 year old getting shot

No niggas do a numbers, and a fans for fist scale
You niggas don't even know the numbers on when the breaks out
No bells for my partners but these cops walking
And all you niggas wanna rap about is how you block popping
Bumping, am gonna war righteous with the stock option
Am over timing these streets, Ain't no clock stopping
Mari-tones to this peace﻿ among my comrades
Screaming out free my nigga, being still he come back
Justice for Tamer and posted up like a thunb tac
On my waist, I got one gat
I show you the real purpose of a firearm
A cop kill another innocent black, and we fire on him
Writing on him, rear view to that bullshit you inspire doing
Minds are ruin, we black hold in that capsule
Pill poppers became the new leaders, that's sad Joe
Little preacher from Stalli, maybe ain't that bad though
Peace power the pot, or P Malcolm
Am down for the revolution no matter the outcome
No matter the outcome

Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Tear gas all through the night
Niggas thuggin' out in Ferguson so get it right
The streets ruthless, the coupe roofless, the nine is near
The new niggas get fools, man, this time of year
My palms itchin', the money clickin', my time is here
Whatever you lookin' for, I'm sure you can find it here
I rose from the ashes, sleepin' on pissy mattress
Niggas was cuttin' classes, ridin' Cutlass Classics
The streets we mastered, in BAs and AKs
Ain't make it to the NBA but we ball like everyday, aye
Word to Trayvon and Mike Brown
Them pigs'll gun you down and call it standin' they ground
The situation wack, we need a moment of silence
Or violence, I'm only being honest
Don't condone it but fuck it, we ridin'
Ain't goin' down without a fight
Middle finger up if they ever try and read me my rights
Hangin' out the window screaming "F the police"
Damn right, a nigga black but he sellin' white
 
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Young nigga sitting in the Benz and it's white on white
I can remember my daddy and even daddy's pappy
Hidin' bricks of the shit up in my granny's attic
My uncle stole out the package and daddy beat him savage
And though he beat him, I could tell it was love in the lashes
He looked me deep in my eyes, past the tears and the lashes
Told me, "Son, never become a victim of habits"
Like Michael did to Fredo, pops shoulda had a captain
But showed too much compassion and unc' end up rattin' and
Just reminiscin' as I package and deliver product
Great men diminish cause snitches often fuckin' the plot up
Put dollars on my daddy books, unc', fuck him for life
Third generation black businessman, my product white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Young nigga sitting in the Phantom and it's white on white
Coming from nothin', I had to hustle up somethin'
I had to get me some paper, I had to pull me a caper
I tucked the Glock in my khakis, I told the bitch I'll be back
She told me "Daddy, be careful, you know all these niggas is rats"
Ain't no fear in my heart, and ain't no lies in my tongue
Won't die broke, I put that on the breath in my lung
All of my clips extended, nothin' I live's pretended
They threw a case in my face, but I was safe and defended
As I stomp on the street, on the road less traveled
As I look up to God as he look down on the gravel
I ask for protection, from hammers and gavels
And blasphemous devils, somebody, pass 'em this message
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
20 grand a night if you can get it right
Sitting in the Phantom and it's white on white
Wanna gun me to the ground like Michael Brown
Settled in the projects, now you knock it down
Now my niggas wanna ride till we all expired
Smoked a ounce for my dog on the day he died
Sprayed yo' name on the walls in the project hall
Died for his red rag so it's for the cause
Bullet holes rip the seams in them denim jeans
The Lorraine Motel was a guillotine
Revolution's televised, operation pushed
Held a burden and a prize under George Bush
Burt back home, nigga did a quarter
Rigor mortis is the only thing that prison taught him
Flippin' quarters
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white
Young nigga black but he sellin' white

Brooklyn
Kinda short, dark-skinned, she a fly lil bitch
Be up in all them clubs spillin' Dom P and shit
Know the boy stunt, Jonathan Kelsey clutch
Yves Saint Laurent fonts on her bags to the pumps
D's love her aura, Balenciaga fedora
Lame niggas bore her, struttin' like she Kimora
She'll take a kilo and stuff it up in the Guuci
Brick of that raw, stash it between her coochie
Niggas treat her like a O.G
First bitch in the hood with the Bentley Coupe GT
Brooklyn is the team, Alexander McQueen
Bustin' down a bird and balance it with a beam
5'5", slanted eyes, bitch walk is mean
Boucheron bracelets and Armani jeans
They're called skinny, my bitch is like a rasta with it
Black car, red bottoms, only mobster in it
It's like damn, bitch niggas lovin' me now

The bloodclat flyest bad bitch in New York
Y'all hoes better bow the fuck down and pay homage
I'm ten million sold and that's SoundScan knowledge
And all y'all rap bitches sound garbage
While me and Ross like the hood version of bombings
The bars keep me stylin' from Giuseppe to my Blahniks
The .38 special in my Chanel stockings
Now that I got the llama in the Hermes duffel
Word to fly silver-fox ?? bubble
The Dries van Noten pumps, Nicholas Kirkwood platforms
So ladies raise your glass to this mad song
It's like damn, bitch niggas lovin' me now
'09 Bonnie & Clyde doin' it now, whoa
Murder murder, these bitches ain't never heard of

Gettin' money, gettin' hurt up, impatient to leak them burners
Money ain't a thing, just look at my pinkie rings
So many numbers in the bank, shit could never be the same
Tom Ford Velours, my drawls by Michael Kors
And my watch a pretty penny, I'm talkin' hundred or more
My Patek Philippe, not for the cheap
And my money in the street way longer than my receipt
Dealin' with the money, no monie all in the middle
I'm dealin' with who owe me, opponents, they gettin' riddled
Box niggas up, on the ropes
Louis sneakers, Louis luggage, the colognes and soaks
Smellin' like money, my body tatted with hundreds
Oh-nine Bonnie & Clyde, gotta live with it like uh
It's like damn, bitch niggas lovin' me now
'09 Bonnie & Clyde doin' it now, whoa
Murder murder, these bitches ain't never heard of
Gettin' money, gettin' hurt up, impatient to leak them burners

That Street Money, That street that street money
I started flat broke, Now I'm poppin rubber bands
I know I'm the shit, I done ate a ton of spam
If the club poppin, I'mma burn a ton of hundred grams check the parking
Lot pimpin, whip cost a hundred grand
I'm in love with shades, I got a thousand pairs
So that's free game, for all you thousandairs
It's funny sour d's will smell sweet
All these niggas think they sell them on Canal Street
I'm sittin twelve feet
Fuck can you tell me, I let the 12's beat
Nightmare on Elm Street
So don't fall asleep, cause my life a dream
And they ain't gotta speak
They know I'm spittin cheese
We got them bottles poppin soundin like they gun shots
Got the models balkin did all with one watch
I hit a lot markets, start' em off with one block
People love the product, so my people come to shop
My uncle 65, he still sellin dope
He claim he petrified to feel goin broke
It's them Caddy Sevilles
Went from acid and pills, to elaborate deals
If you want status you kill
Cause a habit for real
When I step in the spot, treat the club like the
Charts, I go straight to the top
They cost a stack, so dont step on the shoes
And ya know I'm strapped
I'mma play by the rules
Take the good with the bad, In the club blowin your last
Ballin like I violated, Bottles keep me hydrated
Party up in skyscrapers, Parachute to Prebate
Pistol like a paratrooper, tell'em take it easy
Bitch is bad as can be, this her fantttttasy
Left her panties at home
Standin there thick as can be
R- I- C- K R- O- S- S standin there dressed fresh

Junior Mafia niggas'll let the guns loose 
Bad bitch better show me what her tongue do 
Dapper Dan Gucci suits that I could run through 
My niggas comin' up like it was coke prices 
How can you be trippin', nigga, with no snipers? 
Step-steppin' off the jets, still in the hair-rollers
She rock with dopeboys, all shareholders

Shorty said she wanna floss like me 
Never trip about the cost like me 
Live lavish and call the shots like me

Maybach MusicYeah Suave House, street love
T-Low
C'mon
Let's take it to the streets
All those beamers & Lexus, Jeeps
With the 12's in the trunk to make you beat
All my country playboys be going deep
All my country play girls are the stone freaks
I came up in the gutter, ski masks and gloves
Running up on different cars, flashing the drugs
Chasing the paper, never after the love
After I crush perhaps I blush
Blasting the truck
You step in the mansion, you asking to fuck
This is Suave House baby we ain't passing the cuts
Blasting the cuts, gassing her up
She look like her man be lacking to touch
She can say I'm simple, I don't ask a lot
Catch me in the drop when it's hot, smoking pot going out and I be like what
When it comes to the ladies, you might call me crazy
I like a whole lot of street and a whole lot of freak
A love that can represent me
I'm talking bout street love
Making love in the back of the truck
Or on the hood if it's sunny enough
Don't care if anybody see us
I'm talking bout street love
Life of a woman in love with a thug
Poppin bottles of Cris at the club
A little drama but she's the one
I got a quarter piece
With pretty heat that never brings  freak
A little bit of hood like me sexy
Ain't afraid to tip Hennessy with me, ooh
I used to wile out, she makes me smile now
Love of my life no doubt
She's something I can tell mom about
She's just..
Breakin' out extensions while we drenching
In the rain I'm hidden on park benches
Love love, 
Love love, 
I'm talking bout at you job while your on your lunch break
In the car cuz I can't wait , love love
Tef still rockin' the ballys
Go shopping in Cali
Coppin the Nally
Dodging the rallies
I'm gettin it right, neck, swimming in ice
Your net worth buddy, I bet on the dice
Best in the light, it's simple and plain
Meet the coolest bitch in the game
Who's  the same
Yeah I might be the groupie
Came from the wife beater to the cool G, that's me
For slim I put rims on the peach Porsche
A place, fish tank two brims and a sea horse
Nice guy's what she thought
Til she saw my face bearing the reward, 
Passports to Honduras ain't nothin to it
Flashing  the newest you pickin' the wild tulips
Still focus on the money
Still smoking on the gummy
Making sure we're not the next  & Ronnie

Every-day, it's niggas like me on the freeway
Give it a little gas and You told lies, I told lies
I made mistakes, you made mistakes
But it is the love, Am I alone?
I apologize, you can put it all on me girl
My feelings hard to articulate, it goes for love and the trigger play
They watch the watch, and they watch the trinkets
While I'm forced to watch, you niggas ship sinking
Stressing me with an eviction note
So I bless them with a different flow
Now was in the Views of Time magazine
Fell in love with ace of diamonds, but I pulled the queen
Every day we find a new exception to the rule
Face the music, never met a chick I didn't lose
Shorty you can keep the bags and shoes
It's only right cuz the side piece got em too
Floor seats, I really took her to her first game
She was so excited got me like, poor thing
Now she realize she was counting up the chum change
Rolling Stone, Meek and Wale on the front page
Double M so success is synonymous
It's my first single, all I preach is the prominence
Everyday I hustle and the devil pulling at you
On his girl page and he won't put it past you
Double M so success is synonymous
It's my first single, all I preach is the prominence
Double M so success is synonymous
It's my first single, all I preach is the prominence Everyday I hustle and the devil pulling at you
On his girl page and he won't put it past you
Not to mention both car notes past due
Ten band on a nigga still pass through
You only trill ﻿as the niggas that you signed to
20 Mill before I ever seen the iTunes
I'm Barry White in a all white
A curly perm wet for the whole night
I'm 2Pac cuz I got juice, Standing on the mountain top
Chocolate Yeezy boots, let the strings drag on the Earth
Let your queen drag on the purp
Spend a clean stack for the syrup
I sip it slow when I'm feeling nervous
I got fucking in our flight plans
She let me tap it in the air, I get her romance
Passion marks to the Saint Lawrence
Saint Barts, we could stay for months
Away off like the billboard rap list
On the Island seen 2Pac at the last gig
Real niggas and they stranded out of death row
Car full of bitches, on the way their favorite dej loaf
Flight club, the Supremes on, I need queens with the kings like Supreme on
Now you see the M.O.B, pinkie rings on
Take you , held us down to the Team strong
The Black Market is for the few of us, the two seat it's just the two of us

Maybach Music
I was nominated, never won a Grammy
But I understand, they'll never understand me
Lot of lives lost, but I never panicked
Lot of lines crossed, I never did a Xanny
A hundred room mansion but I felt abandoned
Love makin’ love, but where will love land me?
Jealous, so their bitches be actin' like they sleepin' on us
But they speakin’ on us, jewelers quote us even numbers
Still blowin' smoke as angels float above us
Love givin' back, but will they ever love us?
Chanel in the mail, FedEx from Pharrell
And what I got for sale just sit on the scale
Triple beam dream, a buck on the shades
I really seen things give mothers the shakes
I really bought cars for women on face
I know it seem odd, but money amazin'
College loans really did fuck up her credit
Discover cards, look back, I know she regret it
But we keep pushin', keep our foot on the pedal
In the mirror she a blessin', rebukin' the devil
Livin' on the edge, she keepin’ me level
Money come and go, I’ma keep you forever
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever 
Slip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers
Everywhere we go, we create a dilemma
Coming to America, really the set
I’ll let your soul glow, I'm keepin' you wet
All my cold Decembers, I know she remembers
Forgiveness for a sinner, but is it that simple?
Holdin' on your hands, your body’s a temple
Fly you out to Cannes, ménages with bitches
Lobsters and the prawns, thought you was Spanish
Bottles for the Don, our parties the biggest 
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late 
Had a dream she was singin' to me like Gladys Knight
True love in the projects is called paradise
All your niggas left, you wasn't actin' right
But honesty itself a small sacrifice
My money bag heavy, got me packin' light
You movin' funny, can you fill my appetite?
Niggas' conversations, a lot of it false
He own condos right over Carnegie Hall
Speak about your cars, but all of 'em parked
Your niggas' money light, come out of the dark
You really are my type, that's not a facade
One of the reasons why I write, we got a synopsis
I'm always at the top of barbershop gossip
After further thought, better not knock 'em
Allocate some dollars to go out shoppin'
Bitch, we on the real, it's time to stop talkin' 
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late

Nods his head but his finger don't budge. And so we marked. Black market
Looking at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone

Stretched limousines, sipping rosie all alone
Double headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red, cherry head, he said it's just my character
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender

Had ciphers with Ezzy before his mouth white
Before his jaw shatter climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speeding, running science like they don't matter
Haters talking never made me mad, never then
Not when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Bell 4, G4's at the clear port, when they came twos
Fool imma pet boy, when it came to dope
I was quick to export, never tied a ball and so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes Sedan, the next sport, so many cars
DMV thought it was mail fraud, different tracks I was getting mail from
Pope county, Jacksonville, Dayton, Millborn

I got a tendency to send them up to Tennessee
Black Infiniti to condo right on Venice Beach
I watch 'em snort a powder all while I'm chillin' sippin tea
Lemons and honey, millions and money
Gucci, Louis Vuitton, specifically homey
My women imported, I'm neva extorted
I'm very important, 20 grand for the mortgage
Miami nights
I'm livin the life
Because I'm rich off cocaine
Because I'm rich off cocaine
The last bird flew the coup
I Lose the roof
Ain't nothin but the wind in my hair
I'm not bullet proof, I'm fully proof
That you can make it here
All that livin fast
It ain't got to last
Now I can't slow it down
Because I'm sittin on top of the world and I'm not comin' down
Baby mamas I hate 'em

I'm in love with my babies
Maybe mad that I'm famous
Don't be raisin' your voice

How we did the regatta
She miss callin' me daddy
Daddy drippin' in dollars
Daddy did it in Vegas
Yeah I gotta connect

Vacation to Haiti

Seein' kids starve I thought about my Audemar
Sellin dope ain't right
I put it on my life
Chickens put me in position to donate the rice
Miami nights
I'm livin the life
Because I'm rich off cocaine
Because I'm rich off cocaine
The last bird flew the coop
I lose the roof
Ain't nothin but the wind in my hair
I'm not bullet proof, I'm fully proof
That you can make it here
All that livin fast

Now I can't slow it down
Because I'm sittin on top of the world and I'm not comin' downThe More I get, the more I want
The More I get, the more I want
The More I get, the more I want from you baby
If I had a buck for every mile I walk
I'd build a crib just as big as the Skyline Mall
Girls used to laugh at the way I talked
My nappy hair corduroys and my shirt seemed small
After all
Labeled a fat mack I was on my own
So from that day on I was on my own
Polished a man's shoes sitting on that throne
And made me write the song that took me all night long
Started as a poem at first but kept going
Talking rice lee snoring that boy just kept flowing
Recall walking halls and my first pair of clogs
Trapped in my mind when that fonton sparks
Time for a revolution
And it won't be televised, say goodbye to my future
My past was illusive
Like the watch glass must of stared at MedusaThis shit classic, this H
This for all the hustlers
It's for the real ones
Money over the best pussy
Family over money, we hustling
Money that's my life, money that's my light
My money make me mad, my money make me right
My money make me laugh, my money make me cry
My money is my love, for money you will die
Illiterate thugs down for cigarette buzz
Minding my life in prison so I'm living it up
Red champagnia, to celebrate
Triple ccmb, we selling weight
Organized crime, organized mind
One bird call you shot 45 times
45 fully, fully automatic
Bitch is fully loaded, if you want it, you can have it
I'm a grind till my cheese straight
Thinking back to the days when my mama used to say
I've got to hold on
Don't, don't hustle again
Hold on me, I've got to hold on
Don't, don't hustle again
Cause I can't breathe
I've got to hold on, hold on, hold on
Me, I've got to hold on
Don't, don't hustle again
Don't, don't hustle again
800 milligram fresh from the pharmacy
Like Lucas, get it to the army
I keep sit on me, C.M.B. Cash Money is an army
So we flip em out the Jag, 200 on the dash
Bitch we mash, duffle bag full of cash
Louie v bag, 2 mill just to splash
See my homie beat one, nigga beat another one
Then the beat another one, then he beat another one
Then the beat another one, then he beat another one
Like money ain' shit, pop a few bottles nigga fuck another bitch
Celebrate for the licks, celebrate on chips
I've got to hold on
Don't, don't hustle again
Hold on me, I've got to hold on
Don't, don't hustle again
Cause I can't breathe
I've got to hold on, hold on, hold on

Maybach music II remix
Let me warn you now
Maybach music III
Teflon Don, coming soon
We the best!
Realest shit I ever wrote, chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homey I'mma make back
Can you believe it? 
You gotta see it 
Cause I don't plan on going broke, put that on my Maybach
Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music
Smell like summertime to me
First one to cop I'm the Maybach muse
First one in the coup I'm on my third six deuce
White guts, black Benz
I call that bitch affirmative action
Oreo, the Obama
Curtains drawn they can't see me Osama
Cashmere throws that's a splash of class
SC initials on the Tiffany glass
I guess only initial Maybach
I was way too official they ain't call Jay back
I'm just a bully I apologize
And if you were to ask I probably would've lied
This feather, no pressure
As my mind reclines on white leathers
I think back to my first Maybach
Baby blue sides I call her my Similac
Six deuce every time, I never had the Heinz
Fifty seven can' catch up to mines
No diss to Ricky this his song
But everybody know this the shit that I've been on
No pops, no four point o's
So no partitions a no no for HOV
I'm just a top drawn
Pent house every time I'm a top floor nigga
As I drift off further
Chauffeur serves the city's observers
Oohs and aahs they know who's inside
Though I never touch the wheel I won't lose my drive
Oohs and aahs they know who's inside
On the path that we choose I won't lose my stride
Realest shit I ever wrote, chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homey I'mma make back
Can you believe it? 
You gotta see it 
Cause I don't plan on going broke, put that on my Maybach
Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music
Talk about, something that's supersedes greatest
Undisputed hands down been one of the best you get it
Future Maybach prototypes worldwide web balling it
Hotel sized cribs imported marvel every floor
Butlerettes in every room, maids in every corridor
Distance to the other side of the crib is so long
It reminds me of a city block walk to the corner store
Unimaginable raw
Conveyor belts built in the ground to move around fuck a nigga walking for
No longer cut the coke I know the people want the pure
I can read what nigga think fuck you even talking for
Unimaginable wealth
Its raining paper, playing golf with politicians and my dignitary neighbors
You smell that money on me, get to inhaling the vapors
 proof in a situation could phase us
Its obvious I'm back to lyrical saviors
Realest shit I ever wrote, chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homey I'mma make back
Can you believe it? 
You gotta see it 
Cause I don't plan on going broke, put that on my Maybach
Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music
Kush burn like petroleum, crib needs custodians
Shades in all shades, these made of rhodium
Used to be the Oldsmo, hoes call it oh lo
Now I got so many horses bitches call me Polo
57, 62, tell me how you wanna move
Yea you know I got them both, beat your ass black and blue
I was barely getting pretty women
Now I scoop Emmy winners like kitty litter
Any winter Fendi denim like a slender nigga
Looking in the mirror I can see the real contender
Celery for Eben Gregory I'm on my dinner
So what the fuck is ya telling me other than your gender
I'm a boss and I'm riding like a small vault
Niggas make your wheels and ride 'til they fall off
Yea, Ross
Realest shit I ever wrote, chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homey I'mma make back
Can you believe it? 
You gotta see it 
Cause I don't plan on going broke, put that on my Maybach
Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that

Gun charge, I don't bug, gotta make a decision
Flooded the audemar, I bought another car

Went to trial lost it, tried to cry but couldn't make a sound
Choking off the facts, eyes full of tears
Momma's only son just got himself 50 years

Your discoveries filled with names you wouldv've killed for
Nah you can't cry, you're through your old flicks
Brother on your daddy's side now fucking your main bitch
Appeal been denied, no fulfillment in life
It's the life of the party popping pills in the night
Now it's 5 by 7, knives and weapons, lies and deception
Lose your life in a second
See the game, what's the price
High rolling was the dice
Money like a motherfucker, shot 'em all night
Situation bad, pistol on his ass
Come up hard, we had to mash on the gas
Muscle was the come up, game was the struggle
Came from nothing, made something into bubble
Did it real big just for the hustle
Got a lot of it on another level
The precious jewels, what's the price, the lovely life
We did it right and got rich up under hot lights
All through the hustle, knew about the times
So we did it a little time, got back up on the grind
New about the soldiers, raised from the soldiers
Gave 'em all the game, how to be a high roller
Dump the fucking people with this presidential sight
Got a bitch that night, put her on the same flight
The same type of nigga that would put it in her life
Talk from a OG that had five stripes
You is just a fiend just like a dope fiend, shoot up in your veins
Lick it clean with a triple beam
Higher than life, green on a candy slab
Taking showers, jumping out the duffle bags
See the game, what's the price
High rolling was the dice
Money like a motherfucker, shot 'em all night
Situation bad, pistol on his ass
Come up hard, we had to mash on the gas
Muscle was the come up, game was the struggle

A hour later nigga, bodies got swole on me
Phone ringing, duckin' calls, niggas chattin' on me

With three mothafuckin bitches just money wrestling and shit
Not mud wrestling, money wrestling
You see, this is the way life is for some niggas
They the chosen ones
Hate is for suckas nigga, get some love in your life, you'll be blessed for it Yeah I'm still on that '96
First time a nigga ever seen 90 bricks

I got too much money now I'm living Booby life
Moving heavy weight it's funny that my uzi light
I'm getting money see a hundred on a Tuesday night
I fuck with Opa-Locka, I love my nigga Ned
One time for Fat Wayne, my niggas beat the feds
Fuck all these rap niggas, I'm on some other shit
Owe a million to the Cubans, IRS, and government

So now I'm onto war, and you can get it homes
You want to know who I'm talking to?
If it's fuck me, pussy nigga fuck you
They hate the Maybach, they hate the B.M

Blue Levi's breathing on them green Timbs
I love y'all, so nigga love me
You like my only son, so come and hug me
I'm where the thugs be, with all my jewels on
Go ahead and judge me, she want to touch me
She wants to call me, she wants to fuck me
Now should you blame her?
A nigga famous
Let me think back to '98
When Ricky finally rose his right and swore before the state
They gave him life, I was just turning 16
A little G, four hundred thousand when I'm 18
Born on the side of town where them killers ride around
With two open cases, four pills, and a full pound
Chrome in his pants, and he standing like "Fuck you
I'm reppin' Opa-Locka, so don't make a nigga touch you"
We open traps with three workers and a LT
Sticks on deck in case these pussy niggas want beef
It's the white house, nigga shoot the lights out
Stop the whole game when them niggas pull them dice out
I'm fat, happy, two shade, black Willy D
I'm teary eyed I swear to God and a nigga itchy
Triple C, black flag, what the lick read?
I'm a dat boy, who want ?
I'm in the White House
I'm in the White House
I call the shots, I could get your ass wiped out
We in the White House
We in the White House
Big Phantom on the lawn getting wiped down
HEEEEYYY!
I'm in the White House, Dick Cheney my watch out
No Condoleezza Rice it's clean pots and pans now
I bleach the floors, I get clean just like Ochoa
Or Mickey Munday them bricks white as Al Gore
If I don't fuck with cookies nigga why am I the Keebler man?
They don't want that triple beam scale or that beaker sand
Them birds lookin' like my Air Force 1's
They all get checked I don't care if it's a ton
So don't let your boy toss them
In the Everglades, nigga the certified Dade
Bobby Brown baby, in the motherfucking Mayb
Like little Nicky Scarfo with a Colombian named Papo
We'll send a thousand of 'em
You send a thousand more
That's seven stacks a piece to lock down the whole east
And nigga that ain't eating that's a motherfucking feast
Them Poe Boy stacks, hey Ross where we at?
I'm in the White House
I'm in the White House
I call the shots, I could get your ass wiped out
We in the White House
We in the White House
Big Phantom on the lawn getting wiped down
I'm in the White House
I'm in the White House
I call the shots, I could get your ass wiped out
We in the White House
We in the White House
Big Phantom on the lawn getting wiped down
I'm a thousand DB's
I'm 'bout violence no peace
My yacht was a thousand degrees
Drop 'em, fuck copping them pleas
The robbers be robbing with me, they riding with me
In Caddy DeVilles, we tatted the grill
Busted out my product in the dollar trynna get more
Limo DB's hide the murder, in the wind I'm burning indo
Mansion signing party Ren Rover should have been there
Boosie too, Thirty Right
Damn! I'm losing all my niggas
Triple C records and reels, Trilla on deck
Black flag next
Gunplay, Killswitch
Bitch it's over what's over
Cut the check, you feel the full effect
I finally realized how many niggas full of shit
So many murders turned the White House burgundy
Triple secret service whiffing bourbons on purple weed
Addicted to diamonds and hood bitches with purple weaves
Cocaine, Hennessey, Gunplay out the candle free!
Ain't no plan B's with no degree
I'm hand-to-hand on these streets
Zone ? move it by the O, man-to-man D
Torch call me T.O., relocate with them kilos
Ceelo with them burners early
4-5-6 shit cause he sold
That rock, cooking non-stop
Pots never chill
? same block, better deals than them other niggas
Connects with southern niggas getting bulk
Bruce Banner wrapped in that saran bitch I'm shipping Hulk
Soon as they smoke it, they shaking like we're Hogan man
When they bring they mama TV through you know it's that DISH!
Triple C's set up shop on any ave
Disrespect and get your head shot, all you see's the flag!
?
All I see is more cash, your ass in the way
Bitch my name global, same soldier, bi-coastal
Went from dealing weight local to real estate mogul

Nipsey HussleWe’ll never stop, nigga
Never…
I’m hittin’ that hundred-mil mark on these niggas
In the next two years, nigga
Yeah, nigga…
I say, I’m ridin’ on Forges – call them my skaters
You know them bodies is sticky, you can’t get caught up in capers
Niggas are tricky, you can’t be askin’ for favors
2-2-3 go to lickin’, and make your bitch go into labor
Niggas hate when you winnin’, you wanna kill ‘em, I feel ya
Took the top off the car, bitch, I know my face look familiar
Fuckin’ with my lil’ gangters, we makin’ a killin’
When you count your first million you never forget the feelin’
That when my eyes go to twitchin’, palms start to itchin’
Niggas be snitchin’, that’s when my dogs start trippin’
Black belly, I bought a bitch, you know my pockets fat
More money to gain, Double-M on my chain
I just redid the deal, another 20 and change
I step where I please, broke nigga freeze
Cartier bracelet, them Swisher Sweets in my jeans
These bitches love Sosa
O End or no end
Fuckin’ with them O Boys
You gon’ get fucked over
‘Rari’s & Rovers
These hoes love Chief Sosa
Hit him with that cobra
Now that boy slumped over
They do it all for Sosa
You boys ain’t makin’ no noise
Y’all know I’m a grown boy
Your clique full of broke boys
God y’all some broke boys
God y’all some broke boys
We gbe dope boys
We got lots of dough, boy
Still in all gold just like Mr. T
Rollin’ up that Swisher Sweet
Box Chevy with Diamond seats
Ridin’ to this Diamond D
Diamonds in my pinky ring
Middle finger to you hatin’ niggas
That hate to see a nigga do his thing
But I’m doin’ me, a million last year
Even after doin’ that Music Manage tour for free
Now all I hear is “this year is me”
And I told Ross if it ain’t
I’mma clique on and run down on you rappers
And your weak rhymes
I lost struggle because I kept grindin’
Man, speak honest – these weak niggas can’t compete
I’mma be honest, I’m being modest
Freshest nigga, come check the closets
World tour and them checks deposit
New whips with no mileage
New cribs by Cold Harbor
Bury money in my back yard
While you niggas goin’ back and forthYou know I speak from my heart like my mouth in my chest
It's the South the the West
Suave house at its best
Went from crumbs to brick , the other shit
Respect the game  behind the Southern hits
The fam type  still light shit down
No  cartel Tef, white wrist now
Funny shape ice , my money made twice
Still pull guns  holes, roller blade dice
Still flip ones rise spokes, razer blade white
Still walk blocks, call shots, I'm livin that life
I'm the future of the south, isn't that nice
 soul, I'm shipping that twice
I plan to call your names, when I'm giving them right
I'm a little more vocal on the internet site
Until then, I'm living
Cock sucked on the yacht
Hot scotch rolling rocks
Time to sing the hook c'mon
It's On, it's on
We here 
Nothin to lose 
No fear 
Still standing, they can't stand it
Suave house too bitch that's my family
The Suave house booted out all the shisty thieves
Now it's just icey sleeves and nice MCs
The youngest in the pack, still running with the pack
You know shining bird bath stil pumping in the lack
Where you want these slugs, in the stomach or the back
Bad contracts but I'm still coming for a plaque
I suggest y'all niggas start covering your hat
Ross climbing through the front, I'm covering the back
Cover with the black, bubbling the crack
Hustling at that,  with the rats
Slugging for the scratch and the bucket
Puffin on batch, where my hustlas at
Noah, the ladies remember the dimples
Puttin nipples on the windows, of the Limos
Climb through the sunroof, y'all niggas want who
Give me another bad bitch that I can run through
The  to representing
Fuck y'all say the hook
There's, nobody fly, Nodoby hotter so
It's only right I hold the torch and I provide the dope
I get to em raw, like the pure coke
Turn me up and hear me bubble like that baking soda
Uh, but niggas they scared of it
They close but can't see me like some impaired cousins
Blind to the fact that nigga I'm buzzing
My whole clique with me and niggas I met up
With one click, and one aim
We get bread, and we fuck dames
You can, play with us if you wanna
Try us like a pussy and you sure to be a gonner
A bitch with  me and the chicks stay on one
But sex free to watch her do the Jackie Joyner
Curse he, curse me but hurt me never
Chevy same color Hershey heavy on the pedalLet's start music for one second, I got this drop. I gotta drop from one of di realest nigga in Dade County.

Follow procedure, pray I don't have a seizure

I just get high in the day
I need a car wash and a wax
These are simply facts, that I'm stating
The money and the making got me elevated
Elevators on my home, ho I got it going on
On the g to the cold, bitch hit the dome

A piano come with these, cmb, triple CI done seen some things, men can read
I done seen some shanks, that make man bleed

I sat in a cell and watched a old man die
You think it's cooler, nigga's skippin' school
Smoking on a pack of cool's, getting pussy off your shoes
'till you get a charge ridin' in a stolen car
Ship you up north, another fly in the jar
Keep to yourself, put that fuzzy shit to rest
These people killers, they got muscles in they neck
Get punched in the nose, wake up in a coma
I'll make your ass a woman wearing make-up in the corner
You're feeling alone getting pressured by the gangs
Your mother visits she can really see you changed
Talking slurred ain't no telling what you're sippin'
Walkin' with a twitch, yeah this motherfucker bitchin'
UGH!It ain't a problem 'til I say it is
Handle my problem, that's the way it is
Always talkin' like a bitch but that's the way he is
After the ride, nobody'll know where he is, 
It ain't a problem 'til I say it is
Handle my problem, that's the way it is
Always talkin' like a bitch but that's the way he is
After the ride, nobody'll know where he is, 
When you serve a cat a couple of times
Knowin' he serve in a couple of towns
Polaco, Pensacola, down to Duval
It put you in the mind of a pimp like Too $hort
Classy nigga walkin' around with stacks
But I'm gettin' word that he talkin' behind my back
Now is the time to listen, you gotta pay attention
He may pay a henchman, put him up on where you livin'
Tell him all your cars, makes and models
Tell him how you on steaks and bottles
Opium Sunday, Oxygen Tuesday
How you go to the boxin' gym tryna lose weight
He done told a nigga all your routes
And now you got a lowlife tryna figure you out
Catch you in the driveway, trigger you out
That's what killers about, that's what niggas allow remember
It ain't a problem 'til I say it is
Handle my problem, that's the way it is
Always talkin' like a bitch but that's the way he is
After the ride, nobody'll know where he is, 
It ain't a problem 'til I say it is
Handle my problem, that's the way it is
Always talkin' like a bitch but that's the way he is
After the ride, nobody'll know where he is, 
Nigga please, you ain't a cap peeler
Save that ease for your bathroom mirror
No platoon dealer, you niggas baboons
Half gorilla, a camp of scrillers
Triple C stamp the trillest
I got B's I'mma spend it, I don't care what the bill is
Them hoes stay at the billets
And when they ask what year I tell 'em two thousand two minute
A rider without a motive, you got it right I'm a solider
Long as it's loaded I'ma tote it
I told ya, flow so cold, below frozen
Like ice water over the Pro Tools
But that's old news, update the topic
What makes the prophet cut cake in projects
I'ma show him how cupcake his squad is
Duct tape embalmers for makin' them comments
It ain't a problem 'til I say it is
Handle my problem, that's the way it is
Always talkin' like a bitch but that's the way he is

Killers and dealers all I affiliate with

Chop soundin' like a speed bag, that's it, set a date money I'm hungry
So I'm robbin' moms for that wake money

I survived more athletes than Barry Bonds trainin'

First night you tryna hit it raw
Old dog ass nigga
We the best and no else can come close
I pray to god, I pray to god
I fuck that shit up then I leave
I seen the kids in the ghetto
Homicidal intuition
I had to sell crack just to pay my sister tuition
And I just came from off a mission
Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm still geechi
I'm still geechi
I fuck that shit up then I leave, then I leave
Fascinated with these gold Daytons
Fast paper what's the motivation?
Vacant soda make it moonwalk
White club money stuffed in my tube sock
More money, more power
The world is yours, that's until I get my main shower
Butterfly on kilos
Show my the money cause I gotta feed my ego
Big coupe with all my niggas rent due
Put my life on it I can show you how a brick moves 
Thug Life, 2Pac
I'm a boss I can get your whole crew shot
I fuck that shit up then I leave
I fuck that shit up then I leave, then I leave
I fuck that shit up then I leave
I fuck that shit up then I leave, then I leave
I pray to god 
I pray to god
 the pain and the struggle and  hoe
I'm flying first class as the snakes slither
Never blackmail a motherfucking killer
On trial and they gonna execute me
It's really sad this the fact they never knew me
Niggas claim that they thugging, when they dick riding
My niggas rather walk through they own, brick climbing
All black tees, ten gold chains
At the Super Bowl but we in the dope game
Ten years strong in the same trap
Ten years blowing on that strong pack
Lord knows that I wanna live right
But lord knows what that club live like
I fuck that shit up then I leave
I fuck that shit up then I leave, then I leave
I fuck that shit up then I leave
I fuck that shit up then I leave, then I leave
I seen the kids in the ghetto
Homicidal intuition
I had to sell crack just to pay my sister tuition

I fuck that shit up then I leave, then I leave
I pray to god , I pray to godThis here's for the real money makers ridin’ clean
Pockets on ugh shorty talkin’ on the jean
Never get caught ‘cuz my dip game mean
Sippin’ that lean, the fuck is you mean
My game green with your money round here
Ridin'  blowing kush in the air
Chopper on the lap case a nigga actin' tall in it
Nip it in the bub' way before it's gettin' started
I’m not stuck in the game, I fuck with the game
Sleep late, a nice brunch at P. F. Chang's
Lettuce rap, fresh pineapple juice
Sip a Cosmo while I lie in Malibu
I get the truck washed while I’m sittin’ inside
If you feel this, wait till I’m spittin’ that live
If you livin’ a lie, you gotta face the dirt
Fully automatics and a few racial slurs
Eye of the tiger fire saliva if a nigga sound like me I’m more than likely the author, leader
Slaughter, lead the war, great right
I stay tight with the straight type
And take white to the head late night
Stay tight slay mics straight dykes, what you pay like?
Fo’ five six, how I roll my shit
One of the six five, I sold my shit
See ‘em like Jack Tripper, 3 bitches I’m living comfortably
Roll with me and my guns cause three is company
And they don’t like us, feds wanna indite us
Sentence us with the lifers but snitchin’ ain’t like us
How I roll, I stick to the code
I was getting bankrolls while your ass was in diapers
Gillie, you see I let the techs speak
Held a nigga 350 hundred pounds next week
I hit ‘em righty in the ground next week
Golden on Saturday, it's going down next week
We get money homie we don’t wish
I cook a  pizza, colored in deep dish
I re-up ever week quick, so it's needless to say
I’m getting’ money hater
And while you’re talkin’ ‘bout bitches, I’m talkin’ ‘bout paper
Acres, so much layin' I never see my neighbors
Ice cream scooper, those about 400 that’s just my footwear, c'mon
Bang bang to the death of me
Hoes see I'm the chef I got the recipe
So it's best you should know, dolla all about his paper
That's why all grandpas, uncles and brothers be hating me
I break 'em down from A to Z, don't play with me
Not toy brick, no joy-stick, no playing me
Hey, the chicks feeling my swag
The hood scream: 'Reed get in your back!'
So which one? Louis Vitton or the ice cream 
Ice cream sneaks too, my socks match that
 Who gon' stop that? You gon' stop that?
You get popped that, teddy bear, candles , right where the block at
Bullet went through the front, brains flew out back, ughUgh
Floating in my Phantom
Life could be a fantasy, the thoughts that I could fathom
Foes dying rapidly, the currency I handle
Could cause a small catastrophe, can all you niggas handle?
Simple as a sack of weed
Had to drop 80 carats, rose gold masterpiece
Order me a hundred pounds, burn them like a bag of leaves
Motherfuck an interview, got a full magazine
And fuck what you 'finna do, caught up in the guillotine
Niggas in my entourage, the crackers call it killin team
Embraced by the Underworld, realest niggas fuck with me
Nigga got his chain took, with his niggas in the club
Shit done fizzled up, all my niggas game UPGive a nigga leg room, that's what I said to him
Recognize this face, we do the peace sign to 'em
Niggas standing and whispering, I'm like "fuck what they talking"
Stay cool, clutch guns while I'm walking
Hope they stop and duck while I'm sparking
Introduce their mom to a homicide sergeant
Flaming your apartment, slug through your carpet
Two bricks of scale, top shelf in your closet
You ratting on the cartel which was nonsense
A code of silence, I feel a bitch should know
If you open your mouth I feel a bitch should go
Hit the quick vote, okay, slit your throat
Make sure here she's not fit to flow
This the vote, cool, nigga
My fellas, this ain't something that your bitch should know
If they asking about me, hey, I kick the flow
It's hit and go, hit the do', hit the dough
Hit the dro, get some mo'
Flip a bird, but I gotta spit some mo'
Sip some Mo' in the 8-4, yo, bitch, lay low
Any debts I pay fo', spray fo'
Satisfying the mix with the yayo
And I was locked up on the 8th flo'
I'm walking out the house while it's bright and early
Just hung up the phone,  is ready to serve me
Gotta meet 'em by the dock, see, I buy the boatload
Don't trust no niggas, but my vatos loco
When you're me pistols are rarely needed
With these prices I'm strictly business and I mean it
Seven gram a block, I'm moving seventy in seven days
Got seven distributes in seven different states
We money mates, we never break the 
We get your tongue froze from that uncut taste
We millionaire thugs making exchanges in sway lucks
Poke us in on distribution with cassettes and drugs
Never ever gunplay, that's for the broke, I let my mouth teach
Walking with a two point three in the bag South Beach
Making deals, spending expensive wheels for thrills
Counting money so late, man, you gotta pop a pill
Receiving money and load, copping kilos from boats
Before this, you know our steelo was strictly cutting 
Extortion involving bloody ransom notes
Now it's kingpin folks and hundred pound cocaine quotes
It's a bird bath, we move a hundred a week
The player price which can never be beat
Not by a nigga on these city streets
Trying to push a two gram just to get on his feet
This is a bath of birds served by 
Prices you never heard, yeah, my flake is nice
So what I'm young and I keep the caine?
If you come up short that's a bullet to the brain
I could break down a brick
Never *snorting noises* even though I stay around the shit
Spray around some shit, bound to get surround your clique
You was looking for respect, but you found a clip
From the sound, shit, the fo' pound found your rib
Have to wet your crib so I can drown your kids
My nigga Jabar who down on a bid
Copped this bitch a Benz to get around for the kids
Y'all fake hustlers, busters, I'll cut ya
You signing to who? So fuck ya
Musher when I clutch the bitch boy gutter
Box cutter, move with every word you utter
A bird bathtub, you cats will puff herb slaps
By 5 pm I've been in my third 
Serving crabs, elevated to birds
Calimate the first, celebrated then splurged
On iceberg and slow, invite birds
More than nine birds,you saying the right words
My sight blurred with teflon light 
Twenty karat ice work, Prada shoes, nice shirt
Still know it's a pill strapped, cock back, kill tracks
Steel bats, peel windshields back for that crack
Still rap, block niggas feel that, yeah yeah, feel thatPusha T:
Woman: How do I know Daddy this stuff's goin' scary
Rick Ross: Yo Papo
Pusha T: Yeah
Rick Ross: Mira, Yo Papo
Pusha T: Yo come out nigga, where you at man?
Rick Ross: Over here yo
Pusha T: All right, let's stop playing games niggas
Rick Ross: I got that stuff man
Pusha T: OK cool I want all that shit nigga
Rick Ross: Yo, you can have everything if you want it man
Pusha T: ? nigga, how much nigga?
Rick Ross: 3 million B
Pusha T: OK. You gotta give me a minute on that ? nigga
Rick Ross: OK, no problema
Pusha T: Yo put all that shit in the truck baby
Woman: OK Daddy
Rick Ross: Mira, Mira ...
Teflon sicker than most, sick-nature flow
I won't battle for the block rick spit for your coast
I'm handling with narcs they let me sit on the coke
Godfather in a dark shop mob niggas gettin' the vote
Two-piece cufflinks killing the coat
On my feet for the baking but I sit with a toast
My women on the bitch naked or get dick in the boat
Fresh food in the Benz and I'm deepin' the throat
Top down ocean drive and I'm chiefin the drought
Start ten top fuck 'em cuz I'm speaking the coast
Second week out, damn creepin' on go
We still deep in the hole, keep dicks pickin' on blow
They escorted by the killers for that beef on the row
They pretty cheap too get put to sleep at the show
Back at the stage I'm conscious with an object in the back of the braze
I master the trade, since back in the day
Packin' the gauge, quit acting afraid
It's a package exchange, for my niggas back in the classical days
Up in the block I'm still hustlin'
? fro the streets ??
Gettin' no answer it ain't nothin' man
I wasn't on the go ?? strugglin'
Roll with the winners, the soul of the sinners
We drain with ? the limmers
My uncle's before me
Mix the dizzle in the blenders
Then crack came I seen the coldest of winters
Mountains of snow, may fiend strimmer
Minks to the flow we used to Crème de la crèmes
Such a need to shimmer the Benz got the slippers
Club owners love us call us yellow bottle grippers
Flipper, no whale scale tipper
I'm from the line ex-kingpins to turn sniffers
Pray the lord forgive us while the maricons fill us
Up to the brim call 'em the coffee bean spillers
Blast from us he call keys gods pillows
I re-write bury me in my chinchilla
Ain't non iller no, ain't non realer
It's Pusha, just your neighborhood dope dealerGOD FORGIVES, I DON'T

“It took me 12 years to get on and six years to take over.”-Ricky Rozay
With the levying stature of a goliath and the regal standing of a King, Rick Ross has lived up to his prophecy of being
The “Biggest Boss.” The Miami Monster Mogul has evolved into not just hip-hop’s most respected and revered
MC , but as a label CEO and business entrepreneur, his resumé
Is as sterling as one of his platinum plaques
God Forgives, I Don’t is Ross’ fifth solo album in six years, following in the recent success of five star acclaimed
Masterpieces Deeper Than Rap  , Teflon Don  and classic team efforts with his Maybach Music Group
Self Made Vol. 1 and 2. By now, everyone that follows what Ross does, has been conditioned to expect nothing but
A prolific output of the highest grade of music
In a career that reaches new heights every year, God Forgives…is a milestone, the most anticipated rap project of
All of 2012, as well as being the LP that will be the definitive work of art of the past decade
“Without exaggeration, you just don’t hear this high of quality or precision of music,” Ross says about his opus
“I’ve mastered the art of devising classic albums, but this by far exceeds my prior excellence. I owe this to the fans
And I owe it to myself to be the undeniable best.”
God Forgives… has a seamless blend of party hits and street certifiable bangers surrounded by Ross’ passionate
Reflections on life and articulation of his journey to be a billionaire. On one of the lead cuts, “So Sophisticated,”
Ross hammers down heavy-handed statements with a delivery as graceful as Michael Jackson’s penny loafers
Lighting up the streets in “Billie Jean.” Meanwhile “Touch N You” features multi-time Grammy Award winner
Usher and caters to the women who have crowned Ricky Rozay as one of the most yearned for sex symbols in all
Of entertainment
“Three Kings” feels like Ross’ coronation into legend status as he is joined side by side by the man who has garnered
The title of Greatest Rapper of All-Time, Jay-Z and the Greatest Producer of All-Time, Dr. Dre
Ross’ path to walk amongst Hall-of-Famers has been anything but a clear sprint. While some MCs have had the
Luxury of taking the elevator to that proverbial top floor, Ross and his team climbed the stairs. Respect, adulation
And fortifying a legacy comes at a price. Ross has worked tirelessly—even sacrificing his own health—for every
Round of applause, for every time a fan screams “Rozaaaaaay” for every one of his peers that saluted him, for every
Executive that has wanted to do business with MMG
Like every up and coming MC, Ross--influenced by Golden Era b-boys that reigned supreme in the late 80s--just
Wanted to be heard during his introduction into hip-hop in the late 90s. While the desire and the artistry have been
Ross hallmarks from career commencement, he had to learn the fine of art of structuring record contracts as well
Figure out a way to market and promote himself to the public when his former record labels couldn’t
Ultimately, Rick Ross’ time didn’t come until over a decade after he started professionally. He only needed one
Song to break through. 2006’s “Hustlin” which went from being a relentless street anthem to a pop culture catch
Phrase still used today, earned Ross a record deal with Def Jam, and became the catalyst for his debut LP Port of
Miami. That album debuted number one on the Billboard charts as did Trilla which came less than two years later
And while his core fans already were familiar with the superlatives or Rick Ross the artist, in 2009, we got to know
How strong of man the music Kingpin was. Highly publicized rap battles and controversy over his street cred
That started at the end of 2008, none of it mattered by the spring of the next year when 2009’s Deeper Than Rap
Dropped. The few that ridiculed had no choice but to jump on the bandwagon, when Ross elevated himself with
Refined raps and musical soundscapes, all the while never worrying about public misperceptions about his past
While other albums may have sold slightly more, 2010’s Teflon Don overshadowed every LP from any genre that
Year. It was the album you heard coming out every car, the album that dominated DJ’s playlist and the album that
Catapulted Ross to international superstardom
Building on the next level of his fame, Ross’ hunger wasn’t satiated. He knew it was his golden opportunity expand
His Maybach Music Group. In late 2010 MMG went from boutique imprint to a full fledged label, with the signings
Of Wale and Meek Mill as the cornerstones of the roster. Stalley and Omarion have since joined his core and have
Helped make MMG the most beloved brand since Jay-Z had Roc-A-Fella records 10 years ago. In early 2012, Ross
Released a free mixtape containing an albums worth of new material called Rich Forever. The popularity from the
Body of work was so fervent, Ross toured in the U.S. and overseas in support of the new set of songs and Rich
Forever has since went on to be the most downloaded mixtape ever. Now with God Forgives I Don’t, Ross has his
Sights set on a brand new goals, to be the biggest boss and artist of all-time
“When my career is done, people will look back at everything I’ve contributed, and not just speak my name in high
Regard with the best of the best artists, but they’ll also compare my contributions with the greatest executives ever
Such as Russell Simmons, Lyor Cohen, Clive Davis and Jimmy Iovine.” Written by Shaheem Reid
God bless us all
Psalm 27: 1-4
I want to thank my entire family. Thank you to all my #MMG cohorts
Thank you Warner Bros. I thank each one of you who supported me and my team with your purchase. I
Pray we all rich together
Sincerely
Rozay

Cause I'm a ghetto millionaire 'til you prove me wrong
If you visit Miami, I'm the nigga to see
Park the truck, I see the animals, feelin' the Ds
Shoot 'em all, top down, so feelin' the breeze
Who to stop, pop rounds, stop bendin' on your knees
Come get knocked down, then chill on the beach
She was like, "Not now", what we did on the seats
Lit from the twat 'round, legs shut for a week
My  the spot, 
Champagne bottles, pop and squeeze, lots of weed
 really off glass
Spend a weekend with Trina for small cash, I'm all that
Try to be funny, but got a little money
I used to dig her so she got a little from me
We used to club hop with dimes who suck cock
Then we back to the DoubleTree, let the women double me
I'm cool with my women who be puffin' the dro
I got love for my bitches who be workin' the poles
Roll your eyes, make sure that you're touchin' your toes
Gettin' money nigga keep cakin' them hoes
Get up in that pussy then you leave them hoes alone
A bitch is a bitch and a dog need a bone
I'm aight with the ladies who's faithful at home
Cause you leave soon as you finish makin' me moan
All these hoes, which one should I pick?
Hopefully the one who want some dick
Cause a lot of bitches got plots and schemes
If I wasn't on the scene they wouldn't fuck with me
First time they give you some pussy they go all out
Move in with you and all that shit stops
Stop fuckin', stop suckin', puttin' in, no nuttin'
Kitchen ain't clean, ain't shit up in the oven
They change soon as you give her some dick, see
They tried to trick him and trick you, trick me
So you gotta be picky
Cause flickin' your dick up in these bitches will leave it more than just sticky
Blame it on society
Cause I like to see a wide variety
Tell me the truth, come on bitch, don't lie to me
What's on your mind? I may not have been made for this rap shit dawg
Niggas talkin' shit, on records and shit
I'ma put these hands on your ass nigga
You know I'm strapped with the mac
Try me if you want I blow a bitch bad
Catch me on the band she playin gloves and goggles
On a ? Benz V12 with a bottle
A hollow and a handwave?, 50 to follow
I put one knee on blow, your ass been swallow
If you bite me dog, I'ma get your ass pavo
Wake up the no-ribs and the friends in Chicago
I'm rolling in Miami with, momos on the Lac
Eyes ? holdin' a stolen mac
Aiming at the first 'O on your Polo cap
Find the tool at any, signed a fool
Got a half tuition for my daughter's private school
Reason for the violent moves, silent ?
Keep birds on us like the pirate's do
I'm embarrassed to speak for who your signin' to
Ya, ya all niggas stupid for free, fuck
I don't know if you noticed Joe, but I grew up on focus ho
With nothin' to lose, it's nothin' to prove
No other option but bustin' the tool, runnin' to school
With illegal things in my locker, I flame your posture
I critically acclaim an Oscar, sprayin' at your Rasta
? I made a mistake and hit your father
I ain't sued for that I shock ya, snatch your rockets, pop ya
Respect me or Noah ya all better
I'm make you an honorary pall bearer
For small cheddar, bet ya wet ya brung cheddar, funds-getter
You a chipp off a ton sniffer, Lung-filler
My style none iller, gun-spiller flow for fun stealer killer
How you gonna stand the Kelly gave up potatoes for cheese still a peeler
Belly hot top stealer pillar, fedi-feller big-welly dealer
You cheaper than a Pica Deli dinner
I strike like a match, put my life on a track
Hit ? pikes with my wife and some crack
When I get her for a piss, I twistin' like a sack
Off goes the seat belts, out comes the snacks
Cop from mia out comes the mac
Out goes your back, out comes you sad
It's a lot of niggas bark, but they really won't stretch
I have your ass like, man where we goin' at?
If you're lookin for beef, I'll be too
Hang on your back, jumpin' like an eq

.No more love to give, I'm unable
Took advantage of my trust, I'm unstable
Feed me fantasies and fables
Tell more lies than cable
And now I'm hellbent 
Ain't shit change but the tables
So that's why it's five niggas on my line and I treat 'em like nothing
I'm too fine, if it ain't about a time then it ain't about nothing
I gave you my whole heart, turn around and treat it like nothing
Now you wanna pretend to be friends, nigga, we're nothing
All that heartbreak and mistakes, it ain't all for nothing
I'ma trade that for a Maybach, all-black's how I'm coming
Nights I gave up for nights that I live up
Nights I cry will be nights that I shine
I'm resilient, I'm not gonna give up
I can see a lot of sunshine in your forecast
Pull up to your crib, I'm knocking like I'm DoorDash
Got a group of homies with me, guess I'm Offset
All my 'migos know to point me where the souths at
Seven figures every month, you know I'm 'bout that
Got it jumpin' on the Lambo' truck in all-black
Money bag, money bag, I got a money bag
Never one or two, I gotta take a hundred back
And the ceiling of the Rolls is where the lights at
Independent where the dough is gettin' nice at
Never snitching is the code, you know it's like that
Presidential is the floor we rollin' dice at
Kissin' on lil' shawty 'til she wet, wet
Birkin with a hundred in it, you can bag that
I'm the biggest in the game, lil' shawty, say my name
If I ain't rocking with it, mean I'm onto bigger things 
All that heartbreak and mistakes, it ain't all for nothing
I'ma trade that for a Maybach, all-black's how I'm coming
Nights I gave up for nights that I live up
Nights I cry will be nights that I shine
I'm resilient, I'm not gonna give up
Said I'd change 'cause the seasons
But you changed like the seasons
Pick me up with no meaning
Put me down for no reason
Got me thinking I'm tweaking
And you feel like you could just hit my line 'cause you know you're my weakness
Feel it deep in my chest, man
Not the pain, the investment
Plus you make me feel special
But it's good, I get the message
Maybe my loss is a blessing
It wasn't love, just a lesson
And could it be I am delusional?
To come to conclusions that you really wanted me for your own
Could've been told me but honestly, I probably should've known
It was too easy for you to go ghost and leave me alone
So I stay far from 'round you
Even though I always think about you
Brush you off like it's nothing
Hope you don't know I'm bluffing
All that heartbreak and mistakes, it ain't all for nothing
I'ma trade, I'ma be laid back, Caribbean summers
Love I gave up for lifetimes of in love
Times I run will be times that I fly
We're resilient, we're not gonna give up
Broke my heart for nothing
But it's cool, we're nothingRicky Ro$$
It's somethin' special right here
Excuse the marijuana, just tryin' to join myself
We got some gangsta's in the house too. Come on!
I got a bunch of dollars
I can spend them on her
'Cause she can be my lady
She can be my lover
Call me on the late night
Get right he ain't actin' right
Every super woman needs a super man

Sight seein' we might be in the codra port or that new white BM
Home from FAMU with a gorgeous face

Cookin' like home-etch for financial aid

She used to fight with her moms
'Til I sat 'em both down
Now she's tight with her moms 
Yeah I put the ice on her arm

Now my place is her place

So I fucked her like a rapper nigga
All I left her was my swisher wrapper nigga
I bought the rafe like a trapper nigga
Brought the cake to the dealer in the plastic nigga

That's right, the mills do like damn close
I eat ya mill too, we don't feel you

Sweet as banana split, every time I peel through
Fresher than Will Smith and uncle Phil too
Watchin' TV in the Maybach, in traffic
I'm on my feet like tough actin' tinactin'
I'm run in this shit, you should try tacklin'
Lil Wayne in one word immaculin'
You see the Big, you see the Jay
The 2Pac in him, the Kurt Cobain
The Andre three stacks and then I'm back to doin' shit
Like I do say Maybach music
Realist shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homie, I'ma make back
Can you believe that? Woah, you gotta see it
I don't plan on goin' broke, put that on my Maybach
'Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas, can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach musicI'm the talk on the chat rooms

So just let the drinks flow
Later on you can come through
Through, come through
You know you're the flyest
They should call you your highness
And call me king cause I'm that dude
All you gotta do is leave your crew

Because we own it
What you talkin' bout?
You deserve this crown
We got it sewn up
Because we own it
Because we own itAin't got no pie for you
Im so hungry to eat
I want your meatloaf and dinner roll
And pig's feet
I got my eye on food
I really need to eat
I want your greens and macoroni
And cheese
It tastes so good girl and you know it
Better keep that chicken from 'round me
Cause it tastes so good girl and you know it
And you probably won't get a piece
CHORUS
If I'm hungry I'll eat it all
If I'm hungry I'll eat it all
I'll just leave you the bones
If I'm hungry I'll eat it all
Probably even the bonesI walk streets, speak brief to key piece
 y’all knee deep in the streets
Sweet lord show me a sign and close when I open my eyes I’m hoping to find what’s rightfully mine
Serenity and respect being the man of color
When addressed, most politicians ran for cover
We don’t come out to vote, we’ll run ‘round with coke in the projects’ third floor gun ’round with coke
Hustlers ballin' whore, showin' these watchin' so as a revolving door we saw it all before
Neighbors don’t speak shit, they all at war
And in the gutta my nigga, that’s all it was
I’m praying for an angel that can absorb the blood
I’m praying for an angel that can absorb the slug
I’m waiting for the blessings, just show me some love
When my daddy died, I came close to not giving a FUCK!
If ye be willing an obedient
Ye should eat the good of the lamb
But if ye refuse and rebel
Ye should be devoured with the sword
For the mouth of the lord have spoken it
What I did last night, lord, forgive me for that shit
But that 9 to five gig won’t get that Benz
That 9 to five gig won’t get that boat
That 9 to five gig don’t impress these hoes
Cuz a real bitch is not impressed by clothes
She’ll fuck you for free, depending on what you know, what you roll
Some back to the root, the dough baby
Homeboys know the hoes come before the dough baby
I’m ask em all, my passion to ball
To fraction ya all, caskets fall, practice the law flashin the fall eat on my necks if yours
And small jobs to the clean work for once
A dirty nigga wearing a clean shirt, it feels nice
Got the Cubans on hold
While Tony ? wash money
Turn the booth into the block
Rappers got Glocks for me
BANG! 
The lord is my light and my salvation
Whom shall I fear?
When my enemies and foes came upon me to eat my flesh, they stumbled, and failed
You see God sees it all
Now I wonder if God liked if he let this Jews get away with the murder of Christ
Is the God you’re praying to the same God cuz mine ain't white
With a chokehold on niggas in charge of all lightness
Have faith for ass nigga, I’m all prayed out
Got scarred up knees and I live in a crackhouse
Funny how people use their religion to fuck with bitches
Boys get molested inside the church by Archbishops
Preachers turn into faggots
And in the club gettin’ lapdances
Bible contradicts, hands to the last chances
You give your life to God, you’ll be forgiven for that
The muslims fucked around and went to prison for that
I guess the point I’m trynna make is if you’re white you’re alright
All the other colors they try to muscle motherfuckers
With that made up shit, that they fuck with
As far as I’m concerned  can get the duck sick
All I need is one mic, one church, one God, one life, light
And I ain’t preaching for no salary
I don't need no salary
Selling the word nigga!
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
From that is the kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever
AmenYeah, I'm really a nice guy, I say that to say this
I've seen a few dirt bags i head I need to be knocked off
I can't get to you right now, I'm under surveillance
So basically, the government giving you a lifeline
But me and my nigga finna keep it simple and plain baby
You know, I'ma come see you tho'
It's not important how the dough made
Or if revolvers spin like waves, in my low fade
I'll recall coppin' work with tips my hole saved
I'mma smack Al B. if I get no played
No hard feelings, I gotta ball my heart
Time to scar the city, who ridin' with me?
Next in line, the ballman right hand of the Don
Your life lie right here on my palm
And when you fuck up that, right there in my ball
Thug issues handled with scud missiles, fuck pistols
Come and get me gangster, I left the doors unlocked
And when terf's not around, I'm the one that call the shots
Ball the blocks, ? the Glocks, keep all the blocks
And bitches ? the tops ? stop
We all on top ? we call the tops
Speak for the block, speak French for the cops
Sweet links full of rocks hit brinks for the narcs
Pig meat to the socks, Beijing bitch in the drop
Wink to the cops, we could make a bitch stop speak to the cop
Simple and plain, we comin' to it triple the game
Sniffing the caine, dipping the rain sick in the brain
Simple and plain, we comin' to it triple the game
Cripple your fame, dip in the range, we sick in the brain
Who would ever think it would come down to us?
When so much jealousy surrounded us
Back to back when weaponry surrounded us
Survive the hit, we coming with the loudest shit
In the path I supply the bricks, I handle dimes and nicks
Clothes, shop around five or six
Shop for clothes, spread around five or six
Apply the rules, Arm & Hammer when we fry the fools
Silent gooks, violent moods, Carol city it's fine as cool
Hide the tools, in a violent ? play ? rules
You ride with who? Allies join hands, lets unite the states
I don't like to wait, I like to waste, celebrate, light the cake
Make a wish and keep it to yourself
The way I spit, I can't keep it to myself
Took a leap into the wealth, keep you bleedin' in yourself
I came from semen on the shelf
? you know treadin' I walk on water
Sign autographs, have you chalk for a porter
Any further information please contact my lawyer
Under surveillance, by agents across the border
Squeeze fund from slums, to south Florida
? and guns, throughout my quarters
Your negative vibe, tellin' me you're beggin to die
The weapon will fry your left side, from your head and you die
AK back seat and at a '75 ready to fire
Touch me for my rollie you better be lyin'
Let it be flyin' I'm at the head of the line
Rapper body with a head of a lionIf you ridin' with your female acquaintance, explain this one to her girl
When you wake up in the mornin' go mail your man some pictures and a 20 dollar money order
I gotta tell you somethin' else though
I remember the days when I used to jack my dick
And had to catch a bus, to go check a flick
Unless it was one of those nights I stole my sisters car
I brought it back on empty, simply didn't give a fuck
Be my guest you can call my mom
Shes the one who gave me the nickname Teflon 
Added the don
Impressed by the way I kept calm when searched by cops with boy in my palm
Shit, I've done see a lot
I might crack a smile, but i'll clean your clock
I done did it before, matter of fact done it for free
If  was free, he would of did it for me
Guns spittin' for me, Better go get it from me
Guess that 10 year sentence wasn't fitted for me
But when your released, I got a few gifts for you
Half my record label, a quarter mill on the table
x2
How many niggas you rode with will hold you down if you go to jail
Or put the Benz' up for your bail
Yeah, cuz if its fair it war when them riders start runnin'
Will they have to start gunnin'
In God's name, free your pain
Sinc he was down, Carol City ain't been the same
Seventeen years old, floatin' on gold things
The same pain was my nigga 
He might buy you a sack, and let you blow the whole thing
And he might get you some head, won't even know the hoes name
God damn, I miss my nigga
To be honest I wanna kiss my nigga
Hug my nigga, talk to my nigga
Kick the prison door in and walk with my nigga
I'll stalk your nigga, chalk your nigga
If I thought your nigga was a cop oh nigga
Working for the cops came in for the talk oh nigga
If somebody finna' snitch, stop your nigga
If I spot your nigga, I gotta pop your nigga
I ain't aiming at his legs but at the top of your head
x2
Being a black male in America is a charge
Pullin' together your family when your brother behind bars
Fantasy of nice car, wanna know who we are?
All I say to the crackers is "bitch I got a job"
No I'm lying, But I'm talking about a -
Would of rather, seen em scatter
Chit chatter, my pockets fatter
Fuck your corporate ladder
Bein' intelligent today is a dagger
Look em' in the eyes whenever you speak
Make em' feel you were that close to gettin' a degree
I already want a reason to kick your ass to sleep
And they know these employees are far from bein' cheap
I was raised in these streets
Still one of the coolest cats you could ever meet
Besides its only the heat
I don't give detectives reasons to fuck with me
I'm quiet, on the murder diet
I've seen flesh turn from brown to violet
Not one word, no need to dial it, hes expired
This is no longer desired
And last hired, until somone saw it in the streets
I'm the nigga 
x2You gotta meet me at the corner of Pineapple Street
If you dare meet me, you will never come back home
Damn damn

Took her shoppin' for Loub' , said the Berkin was better 
Suitcases full of black dollars , you know I'm workin' for cheddar 
Versace shoes and the robes , and fuck the expensive clothes 
When she lay on her back , I try to suck out her soul 
Make her shakin' and shiver , all these wonderful trembles 
Oh no, I can't be your man , I'm just that one to remember 
We had a hell of a time , you left in time just for church 
Pray that you please say a prayer  for all my dawgs who do dirt 
Hit my phone if you need me , I'm at the drop of a needle 
Hatin' on your G-Wagon , tell 'em you just copped the sequel, that's right

Put the weed out
Double M
Niggas' get it and they fall off
It's cause they all soft
Nigga like me started at the car wash
8am to 10pm, that's on the rainy day
Wise words from dope boys meant everything
They say it's levels to the street life
Then I seen a bezel with that pink ice
All natural, momma tell you to be careful
In the trap trapping to increase capital
No longer cruising with the windows down
Hand on the pistol anticipating the riddle sound
I'm Kanye when it came to yay
I'm Jay-Z when it came to keys
I'm Snoop when it came to weed
So now they wanna Biggie me
As the credit rolls, now the charge is federal
Money bags, I'm placed upon a pedestal
Still on the block in my Reeboks
You ain't even know these was the Basquiat's
You ain't really know who really call shots
Worldwide mastermind, number one all charts
Last time I checked, I only had three choices
In the hood, locked up, or in a casket full of roses
No way to make it out
Seen a few go the college route
But the bills start piling, and they always end up dropping out
Lets just say, Imma different breed
Only mission to succeed
Never stood on the corner slanging keys
I had dreams of making it big and never lost hope
I knew I could still reach success without selling dope
Appreciate the opportunities y’all take for granted
All the times y’all don’t feel like working, I’m taking advantage
Making sure I’ll never end up stranded, empty-handed
Only focused on money.  To me it’s so romantic
They used to laugh when I had three jobs at 18
Act like I was crazy; only focus was making green
Now I can hold our whole class reunion at my house
Laugh now.  Word to Ross.  Feel like the biggest boss
Watch us ball
Stop a star, nigga not at all
I'm poppin' broads with Tiny Hog at the shoppin' mall
All money in the squad, boy I'm not involved
Can't pay the cost to floss? I can spot your flaws
SLs with the toppin' off
Dress well when it's time to ball
Couple hundred for my boxer drawers
Young nigga used to shop at Ross
First to shoot when it's poppin' off
Couple times, a nigga almost got popped by Ross
Crash unit, buzz cut, ex-marines
Crenshaw, Slauson Ave 17
Infant Stone, Lil' Shady, Baby Buke to fast light a demonstration
85 Cutlass with the 380s
Summertime functions, L.A. streets' crazy
Shoot it out' that's what this crew about
Hangin' out the Cutlass window with the Rugar out
Prove yourself, killers in pursuit of clout
It felt wrong, but who is you to doubt
Look, my master plan was buy a pound and then move it south
And hopefully one day I'll put this music out
Trippin' now, seeing that it's moving out
I'm buying spots, nigga moving out
My fan base, I see 'em moving south
I'm overseas eating fucking croûte
Yeah. So I can tell you what this hustling 'bout
I couldn't tell you what no luck about
I had maps on my wall, nigga
Dope sacks in my drawers, nigga
Look, a lot of stress I couldn't rest not at all
Nigga risking everything trynna ballYou wanna see some ass

737 get like me
So fly but we keep it so street
Check my swag and do it like me
Yeah I'm flyer than the best of them
Fresher than the rest of them
737 bitch, that's the new testament
Picture perfect specimen of pimpin' in the flesh
I make, top down music or ? just to flex a bit
Debonaire veteran, know your tired of peddlin'
With petty rappers who say they're trappers with no medicine
Plus I'm riding better than, half of them who swear by that
Know that I'm a client, but i'm still the player president
Lavish is the residence
Plus I fuck with Meryll Lynch
Hotter than a kettle bitch and I got precedence
Over lames who claim they on some better shit
Bitch niggas delicate, been the shit ever since 1983
80's baby and i'm hella rich, rhyme' while i text your bitch
Tell her she's my favorite, let her suck me out
She like vanilla berry flavor dick
Jiggolo I'm heaven sent, niggas hate to use it
Verse 2
Man I'm on the scene with a polo and jeans that's so clean
You should see the way your bitch neck lean when I'm gleamin'
Niggas say they fly but they don't understand the meanin'
Suave House, we been here we not leavin'
Jiggolo I'm cool but look see these heathens
That bust a nigga head on sight no more breathin'
Just give them a reason to click and then clack
Don't try em they been to jail and they dyin' to go back
You ain't 737 cause you got a little beamer
Pockets on beast buy you earn a little leaner
Man up a squad pimp you better get your team up
Flood you like Katrina, you gonna need FEMA
A great imagination but an even better dreamer
To think that you can see us, it's best you try to be us
To go to war ? probably need Jesus
Please believe us we will not ease up
Verse 3
See I used to be modest about it but they doubters
So I put it in their face and let them see that I'm about it
You wanna shine like me but your cues too clouded
These VVS's got my charms so crowded
If you could only see all this money that I've counted
Came a long way from pushin' carts in Thomas County
Now they crowd around me, tell me I'm that new nigga
From Phoenix to Mississippi, I'm down to talent nigga
No need for a hint of febreze
My feces is so easy on the nose, it's like berry and roses
For those of you that's slow, my shit got no odor
Flip her like yoga, fuck her and then show her
To the door cause, I'm on a dough hunt
I'm runnin' circles bout this paper call me dough nuts
And this is no luck, I'm in the fore front
Cuz I'm the shit, fuckin' dirty roll the ? upThink for yourself and you'll find out that a lot of those
So-called authorities are bullshit
I'm the mothafuckin' greatest, y'all don't know that yet
I don't need your money, you can hold that check
At the crib in some Polo sweats
I don't need a ho, that's what the hoes don't get
I'm on my worst behavior
Bad side piece with the perfect flavor
Mothafuckas never loved us
Comin' for your money, mothafucka, don't trust us
You ain't shit
Bought a brand new crib, yeah, I move that brick
I don't want nothin' with your doo-doo clique
Treat her like a dog, how I do that bitch
Done doin' promo
And it's still mothafuckin' Most Dope
Made a couple million off a brand, mothafucka
We ain't even got a logo
Bitch, you better have my money
I don't see anybody but me
And this shit too real
See a mothafucka like me gettin' money
How does it feel?
Already been, but I'm back for more
Insomniac, I don't know what I got a mattress for
Insomniac, I don't know what I got a mattress for
Don't sleep!
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac
Yeah, yeah, said, said I'm a maniac, craziac, same thing
Might need a cave in fact
Chain reactions happen when I make a pact
A psycho, God made me that
Cause I fade to black and gets down like a plane attack
You mothafuckas just made me laugh
Ha ha, God damnit, safety drill, do not panic
Let me see how loud you scream 
I'm off the map, mothafuckas start lookin'
But they're never gonna see where I be
She only speak French
Said "Bitch look, don't try and speak around me"
I don't sleep at all
If you with that bullshit, I don't wanna be involved, shit
I could make a million puttin' my lyrics on a tee
Fearless, Jet Li, fourth quarter, Gretzky
Take your bitch, Joe Pesci, don't test me
Don't flex if you don't got shit on me
And you ain't got shit on me, come get it
Drawer full of fresh whites
Snow bag full of unleaded
I don't get enough credit
Don't sleep!
They've done fucked up, han?
The biggest bezzle, han?
The don, Ricky Farrakhan
My weed burnin', my chain glitter
He's self made, Mac Miller my real nigga
Fuck who don't like, bitch come see me
Fuck who don't like, hitta, hitta, hitta
Gettin' money so complicated
I'm the shit, I'm constipated
Yo baby momma, straight G
Let me use the crib to mail all the weed
California, Atlanta
White girl in the black Phantom
My top down, mid-December
Ride with a big black fat nigga
Krispy Kreme, then it's chicken wings
Introduce you, different things
Jet skis and the best weed
Think it's fake? Bitch test me
I'm jetlagged, don't need a stylist
Pants sag, Jimmy Fallon
Blowin' green in the green room
Def Jam like Baous really wildin'
Yeah they hate but won't box a nigga
Bought the estate from a boxin' nigga
Paranoid, I'm walkin' 'round

Counter tops and coffee tables, butt cheeks on magazines
She feel my vibe, my dick is XXL
So of course I'm a source of flings, call me the king
First I lick her and fondle her nipples
While I tickle her kitty kitty for fifty
Might even blow at it, shitty shitty
And yeah we bang bang
Next week we'll do the same thang
Man up that's the game game
Dick is what I slang slang
See I don't slang caine
But I slang wang
Got lucrative businesses and up is what I've done came came
If you're dick hung down like your buckel, you would do the same thing
Knock out a main frame
I'm too hard to tame man
 
See it's not only their head boy
It's fuckin' up their respiratorys
3 at a time, that's another day another story
See I'm the kind to lay ya down and have ya pussy pourin'
Leakin' feenin' for the d, skeetin' fuckin' up your sheets
Beat it how it's supposed to be

Satisfaction guaranteed baby
I promise I'mma give you what you need baby
This is the night
I'mma blow you mind
Let's get it now
 Yellow Wallabies in the Summer time remember me?
38 special wife beater ain't no killing me
Runnin with my dogs fucking with the hoes
We be acting like stars at them other niggas shows
Luke Skywalker was my muthafuckin idol
Back in middle school I'd watch the videos and get excited
Then I started writing, but really I was biting
All that Big Daddy Kane I had the flat top like him
Fab 5 Freddy with Martin Luther King
He was quick to holler "Peace", boy did I have a dream
Now I'm staring at the TV wishing I was Whodini
Had me dancing like Hammer in the mirror with a peedi
You could see me, Ice Cube bumping as I'm rolling
We all said, "Fuck you bitch!" and kept going
To the pack jam that was our spot walking in
With a nickel bag in my hi-tops
Some things change most stay the same
While I'm chilling in the hood I keep hearing niggas saying
Went and got a million, now my niggas tripping
When you push a Lamborghini you just get a certain feeling
Back in the hood, grinding on the block
Where we all had plans of climbing to the top
Kane got shot, Black got life
I ain't really wanna write but they pushed me to the mic
So I put it on the pad, blowing in the pad
Real D Boy I had blow up in the pad
Tapes of Scarface, the world is yours
Plates and raw cake guns galore
Go and sell a few is what a nigga better do
Everything Federal when you're dealing with revenue
Hoping the casino is trying to clean some
Got 50 in the trunk
Who the fuck you mean mugging nigga?
Do my dirty work give my brother a clean hammer
If mother nature nice it will be a mean summer
Syrup on the dump, chrome on the wheels
Got work in the trunk, the zone and some heels
HO!You niggas ass backwards out here nigga
Your wedge done cost more than your front
Brick in my jeans
2 bricks for the ring
3 bricks for the beamer
4 ounce promephozene
Bitch imma dog
Bitch imma boss
All you hear is when that choppa goin off
Brick in my jeans
2 bricks for the ring
3 bricks for the beamer
4 ounce promethozene
Bitch imma dog
Bitch imma boss
All you hear is when that choppa goin off
UntranslatedPower of pinocha, I just sit it on the sofa
I don't ask him for a thing because we split his gorgonzola
I live with my parents off the Candler Rd exit
But I be in the trap, so you can hit his Motorola
They know me when I knock, unless the doorman’s new
Play some music, whip the work, I got four dance moves
Tell your bitch to wait outside because the floor's brand new
White women I don’t care what your ole man do
Come get this work , work ... work
Work , work , work 
You gotta work , work , work 
Come get this work , work ... work
Riding 'round the city, feel like Baby, feel like Diddy
Shoutout to my city, yes you made me, I’m indebted. Everywhere I go, that red A, that navy fitted
Out in Florida representing... Collins to be specific
LaFerrari or Bugatti, I ain’t made enough to get it
So I’m out here in my civic...
And look at how I’m walkin', you can tell that I be pimpin'

Ride drippin paint Marc Lamont Hill: T-Pain was saying that people are working with Frank Ocean less because he's gay...We got gay football players coming out, we got singers like Frank Ocean coming out. Is hip hop ready for that?
Rick Ross: I feel your personal life is your personal life. In my personal life, you do whatever you do. That's your business. And I stay out of all the other stuff.
Hill: Some people are worried that hip hop is becoming less inclusive rather than more inclusive.
Ross: I look at it like that's somebody telling Rozay, "Your fashion or your music..." You can't tell nobody which direction to take their art. That's the beauty of being creative in this thing we call art, in this culture of ours. And I'm gonna represent what I do, and my lifestyle, and I feel that everybody else should have that same right.Aye

Outside, slamming Chevy doors, Chevy doors, Chevy door
Rims tall as John Salley though, Salley though, Salley though
Gold chains, mainly Figaro, Figaro, Figaro and one of them Rolex links
Mister T necklace, Slick Rick rings, diamonds dancing through the night
Pregamed all day, waiting for the night
I'm on the tree, she on Ketel One and Sprite
Told her take it light 'cause later on gon' be tight
6-4 low rider, solid gold pipes, stars and the stripes
Spangled banner cameras and the lights, stars out tonight
Red carpet life, standing on them couches
Blowing clouds at bouncers
Spilling champagne on my trousers, it's a party all around us

My Chevrolet shines like a marble floor
Baby, keep it raw, have you modeled before
Fontaine Bleau, Club Liv, gold bottles galore
We can party hard in exclusive couture
Starting at your toes and I'm travelling north

Use a Glock for my bodyguard, guard, guard
Throw it to my dogs, now it's far-fetched
I be on the block with Ron like Artest
Niggas saying that they 'bout it but I'm 'bout this caper
Damn near, got carpel tunnel, trying to count this paper
Met a girl named Jamaica but she from Decatur
Got a brother with the work, trying to get my cake up
Had a crib with the lake when I was 24
Bought rims for the car off of ten foot four
Niggas 'round the city, they have been exposed
If you really getting money then it's really dough
I'm on the phone with a bitch that say she wanna smoke
Click on the other line, this bitch say she really broke
Man, what gives
I got ideas they don't wanna listen
All you gotta do is pay ties and pay attention
I wanna thank God for this permission with this intention
The music gets into my party heart, party heart
Now I'm just ready to go, right before the party start, party start

Got a thing for Khloe, Lamar lost his feet
Scott Dis'nick, Taylor check me in a week
Black bottle boy, nigga blazin' peach
Such an amazin' piece, such an amazin' speech

Ruthless records, next Eazy to be
May we live long, rich forever
She can hear it in my tone, rich forever
Standin' on my own, Anderson Silva
Break a bone, nigga gone 'til November
Run in your home, put your infant in a blender
Sippin' a smoothie or give it up smoothly
Don't panic, only lyrics for my movie
You couldn't handle my tender life, for real
Hood stripes worth more than my deal
Motherfucker ain't as real
Ten mil' in a duffle, make a nigga shiver
Saint Bartholomews chillin' for the winter
You makin' wack songs with the nice titles
All chains, no rings, never see the finals

With nobody to love, nobody, no 
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches

Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admitting is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgiving
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party

I like this Maybach music
Sweet!
Ha ha ha!
Come and take a ride
Come and take a ride
Billionaire
Yayo
Justice League
57 years, yes!
Blood for a D-Boy
Hand my mack 11 to the engineer to record
Got the baddest women in the world for me to feed on
Double deck yacht, docked Boss, blowing weed up
Revenue incredible, it put me on a pedestal
Columbia to Mexico, I figure there was a better route
Look at me, a model now
Models and bottles 'round
A Blood holla', ballin'
But the boys in blue, they shot 'em down
Gang-affiliated, colors prosecutors painted
'Cause the niggas I employed, name synonymous with Mi-Yayo
Instrumental that are mental, Maybach kind of mental
400 off the lot, the block is monumental
Some things your money can't buy
Like Heaven in the sky, even a better ride
In the rear, so many instruments I hear
Tucked behind curtain, no sign to fear, Ross!
I'm higher than a leer
This Maybach music, designer shit I wear
May cause you to lose it
Close your eyes and inhale the smoke
It's Maybach music, the realest shit I wrote, nigga
5 ounces, take a toke
Of this Maybach music, the realest shit I wrote
Boss!
Young!
Fuck it then!
Black Maybach, white seas, black piping
Remind me of Paul McCartney and Mike fighting
You know, The Girl Is Mine
Life's A Bitch, so The Whole World Is Mine
The six-deuce long, the curtains are drawn
Perfectly like a Picasso, Rembrandts and Rocco's
I'm a major player, 40-40's in Vegas at the Palazzo
They said it was not so
Certain things that money can't buy
Like being this fly
'Til then, I'm just gonna' ride
I'm like G-Rap with better transportation
On the road to the riches, reach my Final Destination
And the lair, closer to a leer
Say a Prayer, hope I get ta' see her
When I disappear from here, baby, yeah
But I don't see the ending through these millionaire lenses
Just the Two M's on the emblem
The partition roof, translucent and Humador
Where refrigerators, where Ace of Spades, or two I store
True story, my closet is like two stories
Straight to the happy ending, 'cause I don't do stories
Shawn Corey, real rap
The Maybach is bananas, peel back
You feel that?
Young! C'mon!
Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach
8-track episodes, been doing this since way back
Since way back, since way back
8-track episodes, been doing this since way back!
Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach
8-track episodes, been doing this since way back
Since way back, since way back
8-track episodes, been doing this since way back!
Boss!
Can't be stopped now
We got too much cake
They pinching pennies, while I'm muscling for meals
And that muscle be that muzzle, when I stuff it in your grill
Stuffed shells, thanks to crack, I crack
Crab and lobsters, not all mobsters
Imposters, got cha!
Boy, I got an eagle view, slanted on my balcony
Can only stay a week or two, so many people out for me
I bulletproofed the Maybach
Got a killer's intuition
Holding on that mack 11, Machiavelli premonition
Waiting on my Suge Knight
One nation under God, since I chose a thug's life
Guess I gotta play my part
Never will I die, my name symbolize
The hustle for young killers coming from the other side
Some things your money can't buy
Like Heaven in the sky, even a better ride
I'm large, my black car
Menagin' black broads, massage for frauds
I'm livin' large, my fat rocks
I see the kill in the field of hip-hop
Runnin' up on the car, you get popped, mopped and dropped
I'm the Boss!Tell us that you would like to have the lyrics of this song. Then we'll make it our highest priority to find these lyrics first!
Or perhaps you can help us out. If you have the lyrics of this song, it would be great if you can submit these. That will definitely help us and the other visitors!They say I'm comin' too hard, huh?
I say these niggas comin' too soft
All them niggas soft
Niggas over there are soft
I sold that brick soft
This YSL, so soft
My girl ass so soft
These Louis shoes so soft
You ho niggas so soft
My AK for assaults
I'm sippin' this sauce
My dick won't stay soft
My car seats so soft
These Heat Tags say "boss"
You ho niggas so soft
You ho niggas so soft
My car seats so soft
Your army so soft
Real nigga and she like me 'cause I make sure she get off
These niggas claimin' they winnin' but when I'm around they lost
I'm in a new car, four door, double R, logo
Big rims, no spokes, small tires, low-pro
You pussies know that I'm no joke
How you want it? 4-O?
Four four for cinco, no ocho, just blow-blow
Still duckin' the po-po
I make her come back like a yo-yo
I'm like Ice-T with that white girl, still gettin' money off Coco
Still flyer than all y'all, shit tell me somethin' I don't know
Got a bad bitch bouncin' on my stick like a pogo, screamin' YOLO
My diamonds be shinin', like a snow cone, I'm so froze
Far as that dough goes I'm Russell Simmons, you JoJo
My type get real cash, your type get killed fast
Y'all niggas like soft booty - Get it? Real ass
You ho niggas so soft, why don't you ho niggas get lost?
I'll pay to see you gone, how much is you niggas gon' cost?
I sold that brick soft
This YSL, so soft
My girl ass so soft
These Louis shoes so soft
You ho niggas so soft
My AK for assaults
I'm sippin' this sauce
My dick won't stay soft
My car seats so soft
These Heat Tags say "boss"
You ho niggas so soft
You ho niggas so soft
Right back in the hood, fresh off tour
Jumpin' out that new four-door
Bust down APR shores
All this stuntin' ain't called for
None of these bitches ain't all yours
None of these niggas hardcore
Young fly nigga, I'm fresh, man!
Bad bitch with me at sophomore
My Rolex is like Mayweather's
I make it rain like May weather
Ask them hoes at KOD
I don't throw paper, I spray cheddar
Your whip mean? Mine way better
Chicks they greet and love me
Up in the corner and hug me
Go all these hoes tryin' to fuck me 'cause that leather handle so soft
All I know is go hard
High as fuck, I'm on Mars
My pockets on black card 'Cause it ain't no limit 
To the shit I'm spendin' 
It's double-M-G 
Yeah nigga, we winnin'
I sold that brick soft
This YSL, so soft
My girl ass so soft
These Louis shoes so soft
You ho niggas so soft
My AK for assaults
I'm sippin' this sauce
My dick won't stay soft
My car seats so soft
These Heat Tags say "boss"
You ho niggas so soft
You ho niggas so soft
I'm in the hood with that white thing…
Mister Softee
Tell them kids don't run up
Got it on me, now get 'em off me
Get 'em off me, get 'em off me
Before I make it hot like coffee
Just seen 'em put a hole-in-one
And I ain't gon' let 'em golf me
Got a O-Z of that loudmouth
My smoke never speak softly
Ride on that dick flow
My bitch never go off-beat
Only time that I'm off feet
Known to stand on my own two
If you 'round me, you gotta go hard
Soft niggas I don't do
These niggas ain't family
If you was, I would've disowned you
And fucked bitches that won't do
Call a bitch who want to
Gotta feel me, my texture
These dumb bitches too extra
I just kicked this bitch up off the bus, had to "next" her
I'm too strong in these streets, boy
Please don't make me flex up
You know nothin' 'bout this
I do this, I'm a expert
DVs go off, like the TVs in my loft
That's HD on my HT
These ho niggas so softDon't say on the beat what you won't say in the streets
Cause face to face niggas never said it to me
I came here to eat every way to the bone
Never put mama on hold up whenever she call
I follow the law, shine bright illuminated
Got niggas in black hoodies homicide celebrated
Folarin on raw, you other nerds stepped on
In my German couture, the Nation of Islam
Forgive me, I'm flawed, the dollar signs is all I saw
I knew once I got a Beamer, the bitches would come aboard
I pray to the Lord as I'm holding on the sword
And off with your niggas' heads if you come between me and tomorrow
Nike, and I upgraded the Ree's
Real checks is all a nigga sees
So watch where you step and love what you rep
And realize that today is just another test
Say bye to the boy
This crazy world
Is all I know
The cars and clothes
It's all for show
So let's start the show
Let's start the show
Let's start the show
Let's start the show
And I'm feeling like the world's at my neck
When your revenue's sufficient you just work for respect
Every verse, every breath, your dollar woes is adios
Minus the arrogance, my these coons' is maricons
Not even close to touching us, what the fuck is up?
Heroes turn to cluckers and sellers turn into customers
All my money coming in plural far as the women love
All my bunnies outta this world like Captain Bucky O
Hair to the small of her back
Probably just wanted a nigga stacks
And tell me that it ain't cause of rap
And I got plans of me calling her back
The ones who never hear back
My type of ho like an error syntax
And I brought Virginia, the District, as well as Maryland back
But I must have done it all with Rey Mysterio's hat
I put my soul in the culture, but what is it giving me back?
Has your niggas mind erased, don't let your memory lapse, boy
Upper echelon spitting, what the fuck is up?
I'm hospitable, blowing on that medical
And I wish that Channel 2 would give a nigga better news
But everybody hanging with us rarely ever knew us
Forever rude hoes, I don't ever need
Can't stimulate me mentally, then we should never be
However we can meet, it's something from you I need
It's something about women I don't need
I'll forever fiend for, even if a nigga team's full
They riding with the styles and that's word to Teen Wolf
You know the team'll do it, cause the team is raw
Don't know your lady's cleaners, but I'm in her jeans as much
Beg for her feature, then angry with me when I be busy
Before I hit it they was telling me "wire over sixty"
Racks for a rap, racks for a rap
Now I see the same niggas, charge 'em for a dapSometimes when I’m smoking that shit, right bird
Man you ever just pray my nigga
This for all the hustlers
Sometimes I get so high, I just pray my nigga
We hustling
I be coughing this shit, hustle
And I just be thinking bout
We blast off, god love us, my nigga
Real talk
Sometimes I recite song 27 : the lord is my light and my salvation
Whom shall I fear?
Not nothing of these fuck
Coming up a nigga had to fight for erything
Now I’m at the fight 3 rows from the ring
Call some don king, …jay z
Looking at this picture, bitch better say cheese
Who shine like boss, a birdman junior
We still got birds, don’t let birdman fool ya
We just so blessed, lexus stretched
Tears in my eyes and I mean
The fam so trill, we just so rich
You could fuck my bitch, let me fuck your bitch
Sacks in the attic, ciroc on the yachts
Knots in the pockets, baleys, no socks
Cash is a heavy, monkey on my back
So I’m riding with my dog, with the chicken on my lap
Fascinated with the shine, get high off the H
Call you when I come down
Young gutter, been running for 10 summers
Bad bitches lust, you pay for pussy, they front us
Young boss talking, you lil niggas is runners
The deals that I’m aching to turn, my gun is the stunnest
It’s lies that you speak, the truth lies in numbers
The wheels on the new coupe, humongous
Bet that, maybach wet black
Curtains close on the motherfucker when I sit back
Yeah, got the game from the stunner man
Yeah, but I still keep it gutter man
Money wrapped up in a rubber band
Give it to my bitch, tell her blow a lane nothing down
Just a young nigga shitting, dumping
Maybach music in the maybach bumping
Gt vodka got me feeling right
Just a young nigga getting money man I’m living right
Oh you lil fresh lil fly like that nigga, H
Rest in peace to the rest in peace
Come through nigga when I came through shooting
Niggas popping off so I had to shoot him
Shot him up, pop it off, that’s how we do it
Got the money moved out and that’s how we do it
Ak, I’m in the hallway, you niggas get sprayed
You niggas can’t fade, get laid
A nigga get flayed
Fuck a nigga when we land, man we wet
Chop em all then we chopped up
Chopped up, got other niggas chopped up
Upstate nigga came together got bucked
Ain’t nothing came so we did it, so we did us
Another night in the new bus
Smoke till we see dust
Another bitch and she on us
Ball till we can’t flush
This that H experience
This the volume one, lost tapes
These records was recorded years ago
Bitch we make time this music
Catch up, we hustlers
We winners, we rich, we the greatest
We the best, bitch we the business
We made it, we will never stop
Birdman, ricky rozay
Miami, new Orleans, every ghetto across the world
Every hood, every project
You feel the pain in the music
We out here, HTell us that you would like to have the lyrics of this song. Then we'll make it our highest priority to find these lyrics first!
Or perhaps you can help us out. If you have the lyrics of this song, it would be great if you can submit these. That will definitely help us and the other visitors!Maybach Music

Una shorty que me lleva hasta la luna
Tengo los tiques y los puedo gastar
A ti te gusta el efectivo y lo yates en el mar
Vamos a celebrar
En este party no hace falta na
Champaña de belaire las Mamis tán de más
Me siento un campeón de tanto ganar
New year at the party
We don’t care about the money
VIP filled with honeys
So we out to the party
Tu sabe dónde vamos a a terminar
Estoy obsesionado con esa obra de arte
Que bien te lucen todos mi diamantes
Pero es sin ropa que yo quiero verte
Dinero en el aire 
A ver si te motivas pa que me baile 
Llama a tus amigas y ven y caile
Prende las activas si ta que arde 
El party se encendió 
Me puse pa ti 
Ando con Ricky Ross
De aquí pa los jet ski
100,000 en el reloj
Ni yo me aguanto aqui
El after party va
Seguir pa Medellín 
En este party no hace falta na
Champaña de belaire las mamis tán de más
Me siento un campeón de tanto ganar
New year at the party
We don’t care about the money
VIP filled with honeys
So we out to the party
It’s the boss
Celebrating every second
Let me show you how 
Time to stand up on the couch
And try to roll a ounce
Money to the ceiling
Guess I’m trying to hold it down 
Eddie Murphy money
Call your boy the golden child
Diamonds on my neck
Diamond on my neck
New year new money so you know what’s next 
Shorty on the list
Shorty on the list 
Roly on the wrist
Roly on the wrist
In the CLS with the homie PLF 
Khaled on the FaceTime screaming we the best 
Blowing thick smoke call it big smoke 
It’s the big fish yachting on the big boat 
New year at the party
We don’t care about the money
VIP filled with honeys
So we out to the party
New year at the party
We don’t care about the money
VIP filled with honeys
So we out to the party
New year…She wants the sweet life, the sweet life
She wants the good life, she's a boss and she knows
She don't even wanna know
Here we go
That lingerie right in my living room
She know I got it, ain't never give a Bentley to her
Remember movin work with Scott up to my dormatory
She read a lot of books, I live 40 stories
My manager ballin, he got an asian
Fuck up the place, she ready for an invasion
The major Arrogants come with the conversation
I cop convertables, so that's our conversation
And I just bought all my cars a new face lift
They ain't come yet, so I just got her a new bracelet
When that brain in, I just might throgh a chain in
I'm a hot boy, my chick flamin
She wants the sweet life, the sweet life
She wants the good life, she's a boss and she knows
She don't even wanna know
Here we go
She got a man, but I'm textin her are you out yet
She understands the playa, look at my outfit
Took her to my crib, she said it look like an outland
Took my power cord, and plugged it into an outlet
She was shocked at the boats I got
Had her body shakin, electrcuting on the spot
Champagne, she making love to a Grammy winner
Bring her to Miami, I could put another Grammy in her
I'm the one these niggas emulate
I live the club life, so I get the tennent rate
Them bottles comin like I give them away
I got you Ds, baby, you my newest real estate
She wants the sweet life, the sweet life
She wants the good life, she's a boss and she knows
She don't even wanna know
Here we goYep, yep, yep, I'm back, I'm back
Slip-N-Slide Records, Slip-N-Slide Records
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm single again back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again, back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again
You know how they do, how they act
See you with another man and they want you back
My ass still phat, they still checkin' for me
And never will you find another bitch like me
And I don't care what your friends say
What we had was like Jay and Beyoncé
Mmm, or was it all a dream?
Backseat in the Phatom, sippin' that lean
We party like rock stars, we sex like porn stars
I'll sex you a million bars
I'm single again back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again, back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again
Stop callin' me apologizin'
Don't even start it
Hope you find what you lookin' for
Back on the market
Let's agree to disagree
Don't explain shit to me
I got my own money, there's nobody I need
I need, I need my own space
I'm single again, who's who I'm minglin wit
Ball players, center seats to the game
Ring side, still doin' my thing
Changed my number, switched my cars up
6 months bet you maxed your cards up
It all started so promisin', got my own diamonds
So I didn't break the promise ring
I'm single again back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again, back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again
Hold up, wait a goddamn minute
It ain't over 'til I say we finish
'Til I get my half
Then I sit back relax and just laugh
And the times we shared
Like flyin' over Beatmore High in the G-4
Smokin' on Cali bud
That's how real G show a bitch Cali love
Sex in the cockpit
No love, I was just another object
You fell in love wit my ass
King magazine, you fell in love wit my ad
20 G's in the Prada bag
And I'm 'bout ball out
Had to get my mind right
I'm back in the limelight, fellas!
I'm single again back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again, back on the prowl
I thought it was perfect, I don't know how
I'm single again
Diamond princess
Yeah, I'm still the baddest bitchRegardless of how it goes down, life goes on
Am I right?
On the way we shed some tears, every day we sacrifice
So we can be standing here, oh, what a hell of a life
Been winning so many years and the future is bright
Now it's very clear that we gon' be rich forever
And ever, and ever, oh-oh, oh-oh
We gon' be rich forever, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, we gon' be rich forever 
And ever , and ever 
I remember bein' blind to it
'Til the day I put my mind to it 
Pen and pad on the dresser for me to fine tune it
I sat in the corner, made up my mind, do it
Def Jam on my heels, should I sign to it?
Million dollar advance for me to rhyme fluent
Every day I'm hustlin' on every corner boomin'
Back of the Phantom, couldn't fathom, I was such a student
Grandfather deal for the Godfather
Lucian Grainge from the ghetto, I follow God's orders
And he told me I was rich forever
And he showed me I was rich forever
They call me Mr. Roberts when I'm in the bank
Digits like the Dodgers when it come to franks
Flossin' out in Compton like I got a cape
RoseMo tried to fight it, but barely niggas fade
White sheet, yellow tape, where your dogs at?
Count a million cash, can you blog that?
Me and niggas your type never exchange numbers
Want to conversate and steal game from us
See the watch, now you want to know the name of it
Never playin' so I went and got the frame flooded
Cartier, Hublot, I could name a dozen
Your shit pushed back cause it ain't buzzin'
Now these thugs actors all of a sudden
Niggas hustle backwards all of a sudden
Can't talk snow, where the soft at?
Your man got murked, but you squashed that 
Hope you know what we call that 
I think you know just what we call that 
All you pussy boys fall back
Big face Rollie, rose gold cost 40
Platinum twenty-one, it's time to go and spoil shorty
You only live once I'm screamin' YOLO in the VI
Time flies fast ballin' with my nigga T.I
Ciroc, no glass, smilin' women in my presence
Tall supermodels always fall in my possession
Atlanta housewives takin' pictures in my section
But I only got a thing for young bitches with aggression
Show me that affection that a D-Boy craves
Rich forever in my D-boy ways
So dope, blue jeans, new J's
Sold dope by any means all day, uh
Been winning so many years, and the future is bright 
I'ma come back with an— the, the other song that I ever did with Ye, actually 
Um, we started both of them on the same day and ended up finishin' 'em at different times
And big, big, big love to Mos Def 
In that "You Don't Know My Name" video, which is such a vibe
Uh, this one—{Maybach Music}
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos 
I only fuck with niggas in them Lambos 
Doors going up, hoes going HAM
Doors going up, hoes going HAM
Niggas buyin pussy, niggas buyin pussy
Niggas buyin pussy, niggas buyin pussy
HUH! Yeah...
Gucci, Liberace, Dope Boy and Versace 
Came from beefaroni, all I see is lobster 
Lamborghini lover, keep my bitches darkest 
I pay them boys to do it, keep my record flawless
May run for state attorney just to free my dogs
I chose to run these streets until I was a boss 
Don't call it yo house until you paid it off
I pay up for a mouth just like a round of golf 
I try to stay in shape, I'm standing counting ones 
Red Lamborghini, bitches know I'm drivin one
Niggas buyin pussy, boss buyin pussy
I could buy the club, boss buyin toosies
Diamonds on my neck, call me K.O.D
I just want it for a nigga, so I pay the fee
 + 
Chea! Yeah, yeah

It's just how we mob, we don't know a nigga
She put me in her past and she moved on
But I keep her sexy ass in my new songs
We all make mistakes, we gone fight
There to wipe a nigga tears in the late night
She wanna cum before me, tell her, "Wait a minute!"
Now we on the water, elevators in it

Ghost, with the most, see no competition
Working in the club and guess who gotta tip out

Rims on the coupe, baby, haters wanna sue
Me and you against the world, what you wanna do?
What you wanna do? What you wanna do?
Frustration 
Hesitation 
Come closer baby 
One question: Am I moving too fast?

Your empty heart and my empty bottle and yellow cab

So I figured the perfect catch would be you if I made the pass
Pool full of liquor then we dive - in it
Knowing if I lick her I might die - in it
Then reincarnate as a fly - gymnast
Just to flip my tongue on you
This the Olympics
State your name, live in the moment
It’s your time to own it, I see it in you baby
She tell me that she never get a first let away
And life is a bitch, but every dog has its day
Holla pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind
Pull up them big trucks, that pack come behind
Pool full of liquor then we die - in it
Pull 'em to the side, let me slide up in it
Or waste your time, or waste your time

Speedin’ in my fast car
Reminiscin’ on the girl I last saw
And how she cut wood like a hack saw
Wax on wax off man that ass soft
Attached to my fitted
But I get that kitten hat soft
I was jimmy hat strapped when I fell up in that cat paws
All over my body
Me on for my yonin balls had the head down tails up like a coin toss rollin’ up a body
Stretchin’ like pilate, 110 Masarati
Burnin’ down the highway
Burnin’ on some Marley
Could this be love infatuation of the body
The facts is that I’m sloppy with my feelings and it's got me
Chasing love at six in the morning
Horny as a dog in heat chasing after pony
The streets is lonely
It's just me and the stars
Me and my thoughts
Could it be me and the Godess?
Well if I play my cards right
Tarot cards on my dashboard if they re-write
Or leave me right back to my queen tonight
Right?This almost as beautiful as Naomi Campbell
Nothin' is as beautiful as Naomi Campbell
Hmm
Now that I'm a man
Hmm
(And I cannot let you go 'cause I know
I want you forever, so I say)
Yeah
Still dealin' yayo in my down time
Run my record label like that bitch an airline
I know pastors who be geekin' in the pool pit
Evasion tax, evasion strap  with this full clip
Get you burried arms crossed, you'll have him by your side
Would you live with common sense or rather die with pride?
Vogue magazine, they quote that boy from side to sidе
MET Ball, I met Naomi, but to my surprise
Her hands was soft, shе turned around, I'm starin' in her eyes
I said my name, she slightly smiled as if she recognize
Complimentin' her appearance, from a shy side
Bumped into Madonna, speak to her some other time
King met his Queen, yes  he fantasize
Open doors, orgasm, just off my vocal chord
I thank the Lord for the day that she get to know they boy
Pop a bottle, I think I'm about to smoke some more
You gotta be special to catch my eye, shawty
And if you do catch my eye, you gotta be a motherfucker to keep it
I'm a young nigga that done been round the world sixty-one times
All my bitches ask me how many bitches I got
Can you count the raindrops as you look in the sky?
Are you my main bitch or just a chick on the side?
Can I trust you with some chips or just keys to my ride? 
If you're not a soldier then you're just wastin' my time
I chase money, the Tequila I lace it with lime
So infectious with this flow but this took me some time 
Sky  but she's one of a kind 
You meet the quarters then you get the serenade 
 loafers, long sleeves, silks be tailor made 
Black chauffeurs who open the door and anything 
It's amazin' the jealousy all this cheddar bring 
I could see a million with a pair of dice 
Ain't  as long as we on the sattelite 
It's Basquiat boss when it come to paint
And when I'm followin' my heart, don't tell me what I can't
, hmm
Even rich niggas need inspiration, shawty
Inspiration the only thing I can't buy
And I don't finance
I put them Bentley trucks out on them city streets 
That white G-Wagon really with them pretty seats 
I'm so familiar with the DMV
Lookin' at my , think I give 'em ten a piece 
This why eality separate with raps 
Walkin' through the mansion, nigga really need a map 
GPS my bitches from the third floor 
It's well known the whole world is my territory 
I'm shell shocked by the real wars
Still wack a nigga for a pair of Jordans 
The flyest nigga in the Air Force
If the bitch bad maybe I'll care for her 
Shawty got me pussy , I'm starin' in her eyes 
I'll be the type of nigga that'll change your life
I got bitches that I showed a lot of love to
Sat on corners and they showed a lot of love too
When you look in the mirror you should see Naomi
Naomi CampbellI'm addicted to pissing in unbelievably expensive custom shorts
In a brief moment of lucidity I went to the short dealership and I told them "Do not, under any circumstances, let me piss in more shorts"
I was back there half an hour later, wearing a fake mustache, and I said "Hello, I am Brick Ross, a man you have never met before. give me 10,000 shorts to piss in"
LmaoMan I’m tired as fuck, I just woke up
I couldn’t fuck them hoes man
I’ll fuck one of them hoes, I’ll bust a nut quick as fuck
I’ll fuck a hoe for about a minute and a half, nigga maybe a minute nigga shit
And I counted that change, shit and I went to sleep on that bitch
Fuck you been doing nigga you been quiet as fuck over there
I’ve been sipping all this cough syrup and still coughing
Taking all this fucking Adderall, I’m sleep walking
Smoking all this fucking loud, I mean it’s real noisy
Take your bitch she can’t be found, I’m talking milk carton
I’ve been popping all these pain pills and still hurting
Popping all these Percs, call me Lil Wayne Perkins
Lil Tunechi, you can call me Pill Gates
All you niggas real fake, I like my kill laced
I live in Miami, I see real dolphins
Do donuts in the Lamby, I get real nauseous
Sipping out my GRAMMY, Best Hip Hop Artist
Get a bitch some Xannys, ain’t no Bill Cosby
I do business in her panties that’s my real office
And these Jordans I got on come from the real Jordan
Why your boyfriend gotta act like he your drill sergeant?
Enjoying the fruits of my labor have a peeled orange
Holding hands around the table with the meal on it
Eating all these niggas food although we still starving
Money, clothes, cars, and hoes I keep it real foreign
Pill Gates I make your hoe pop a pill for me
I want it all, Wingstops on every corner
I want a mall and I’m ’bout to build a Benihana
Bond out my dogs, quarter million on a new appeal
They call me Bill Gates and they know the money real
They wanna know my name, I tell them Bill Gates
Just blew a hundred million and I’m still straight
They started waving flags when the rockets came
Just put a hundred kilos on the stock exchange
Silk sweaters, dirty Berettas, and petty vendettas
Niggas is jealous I get it bring it when and wherever
Court dates and caskets I’m tryna stay composed
Out on bond on the run won’t ever sell my soul
Doing bad I shorted my connect a cool mil’
At the lab tryna keep my name out the news reels
Or at the Palms and I know the feds across the hall
I got a bitch who licking balls my back against the wall
All black photographs could speak a million words
One selfie with me and they think you’re dealing birds
Louis towels and the Gucci slides
Bill Gates still real when it’s out of style
Crack money, Nike sweats, wake up in night sweats
Homemade key lime pie we cutting slices
All my people eat at the table when we say our grace
One eye open for the Judas who wanna take my place
Twelve disciples I got two shooters nigga ten bodies
Caught a few niggas living thinking that I ain’t bout it
Dickie shirts, blood stains, come with the drug game
Cell phones tapped fast, money and cum stains
Public defenders say a number and you niggas tremble
Judge dropped the mallet mayor we’ll put a bullet in you
Louis towels and the Gucci slippers
Bill Gates still real and I keep it trilla
I want it all, Wingstops on every corner
I want a mall and I’m ’bout to build a Benihana
Bond out my dogs, quarter million on a new appeal
They call me Bill Gates and they know the money real
They wanna know my name, I tell them Bill Gates
Just blew a hundred million and I’m still straight
They started waving flags when the rockets came
Just put a hundred kilos on the stock exchange
Cold cases they wanna put me in the hot seat
Finger Licking leftover lobster in the front seat
Niggas follow me in hopes of finding my stash box
In the Ghost like the Pope the all glass top
Look around I smile at you as I’m looking down
Bill Gates that red Chevy just be thumping loud
I put my niggas on they feet we can’t be fucking up
So fuck a hundred bricks flip a hundred restaurants

Debatin' Ivy League over the UCLAs
I struggled at math therefore perfected my craft
In the back of my mind I said "Establish your staff"
Right or wrong niggas make mistakes
You shed your tears and then you wiped your face
You hold your head to the sky, you put your face in the light
Makaveli the Don, I pray I make it tonight
They never said that the odds were fair
Now we standin' in line for that Obamacare
Pray for a better today, bring my brother home
Nigga murdered a child, what the fuck you was on?
I just wanna let my top down
But I'm still runnin' from the dark cloud
It got me prayin' for some sunshine
You got me prayin' for that sunshine
And I'm prayin' for a better day
I'm just prayin' for a better day
The spotlight on my fans
Sunshine, I can’t tell a lie
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now
I'm drinkin' Cabernet, think of better days
Rock 'til my beard is gray like Frank Bev and Maze
In this maze they called us the black rats
Because we trap from the projects, we stack that
Hopin' I reach twenty one, nigga black jack
Blackstrap molasses in the backpack
Dreamin' of the pussy that I slept on, cat nap
Moon walk like Mike Jack, but never backtrack
I hold the MAC that
Them panthers and the black cats used to hold
The Kendrick Lamar Odom cause I lose control
When it comes to dope raps, yeah nigga you can quote that
Used to hold back like a masseuse
The fruits of my labor is to produce
On Netflix watchin' Juice
I wanna 2pac the people
That mean keep 'em regal, at the same time lethal
The spotlight on my fans
Sunshine, I can’t tell a lie
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now
I don't like to boast but they ain't touchin' the flow 
Fuck a therapist, I put everything in this cone
My only fear is marriage she scared of bein alone
She settle for this bread so therein should be a trophy
I'mma prolly marry somebody already familiar
VH1 10 and I'm not thinkin about these bitches
Can do without opinions
Another brother caught up in the business
Had that lock since I lost my scholarship
I been gettin' it to my old coach and ballin'
Rose gold was forty, dopest nigga recordin'
Make hoes sprint the 40
See me I thought money would change it it got worse
But its alot better than screamin "who got work?" 
From opening up for Back to packing out 9:30
I never sold crack when crack rappin was workin
With that fact its back packin and murkin
Gettin' that Bobby Heenan while you Mr. Perfect
We ain't posed to never ha-
We ain't posed to never haveShorty I got more money than I've ever had
You the only thing I need right now
You make it all so simple
You my new thing
I fuck her like an addict
She fuck me like she mad at me
But it's all cool though
I flew out the niche just last week
When I'm away she send me pics in the sheets
All my cars, and my sneaks
Wait, let me keep this shit simple
Fuck the radio, this just a nigga tempo
Fat boy, blue jeans, and a gold watch
Started at the bottom, and she rolled on top
Black Testarossa, 0-60 on the strip, she's explosive
Just got back from Dubai
Emirates live, flew in with 1. 5
Never fold is the threshold
Like my mother sayin', now never let go
Hood nigga with a
Bad bitch, but she special
Went home, and I prayed for an angel
Appeared in the dark, here to take away the pain too
War wounds on the big dawg
But she get the ball like it's tip off
Watch D-Wade, got two seats
Got her everything but the
Cardier wings, nigga, two seats
Nigga gettin' money like a new Meech
We the knights of the Templar
Dirty little nigga with ten cars
This whole click another Enron
Baby girl it's time for you to get gone
There's a shoulder just to lean on
Rozay baby, and the team strong
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, babyWelcome to my hood
Welcome to my hood
Everybody know everybody
And if I got it everybody got it
Welcome to my hood
Look at all these old school Chevy's
24's so you know we roll heavy
Welcome to my hood
They outside playing hopscotch
And every know this is the hot spot
Welcome to my hood
Them boys will put you down on your knees
 That's the sound of the police
In my hood
Audemar on my wrist
Diamond, look like they glowing
50 stacks, all singles, I make it look like its snowing
Black unmarked cars, gotta peep how they playin'
Treat 'em like jack boys, catch 'em slippin' then slay 'em
Lord forgive me for my sins
That's my confessions if they put me in this Benz
I got possession of a federal offence
I'm talking pressure in my criminal intent
So wear ya vest's and I'm still gon' stunt
Like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck ya house note nigga
Blow that bitch on a bottle
The Ferrari just a front, got the Lambo in the back
Tell you "we the best forever" DJ Khaled handle that
I know some niggas from my hood that would rob Noriega
I'm talkin' Noriega, nigga, the real Noriega
If you ain't from the hood, bitch, than stop impersonating us
And tell congress when you see 'em bitch I'm stealin' cable
And leave the D-Boys alone 'cause they motivate us
And why is the half of my whole hood on papers
Some are on house arrest, some are on child support
Some of 'em did they bit, the other half waiting to go to court
Mr Landlord we gon bust your ass with an eviction note
Better have the police with you dog, if you came to repo
I'm talking strip clubs, I'm talking liquor stores
We throw our money round here, but y'all can
Bitch I'm on probation, so my nerves bad
And they say time fly's, well mine's first class
I landed in the sky, I fell from the streets
I talk a lot of shit and practice what I preach
Back from hell, cell twenty three, tell the warden kiss my ass
Pockets on Monique
Bitch I'm from the murder capital
Hoe, I'm far from practical
Shit happens and since I'm the shit, I'm who it happens to
Young Money, Cash Money, blood bitch, I'm red hot
I don't see nobody, see nobody like a head shot
All that bullshit is for the birds, throw some bread out
Got it sewn up, check the thread countTell us that you would like to have the lyrics of this song. Then we'll make it our highest priority to find these lyrics first!

Now me, I'm the life of the party
A little bit of juice, little bit of the gin
A little bit of Moet, bottles of the Rose
Feel a little buzz then I'm gettin' it in
Now me, I get it in, I get it in
Me, I get it in, I get it in
Now me, I get it in, I get it in
Me, I get it in, I get it in
Look as soon as I step in the club
I swear, my nigga, you can feel the attention shift
Started around twelve, ended up around two
I better leave with more hoes than I came here with
I can't be responsible for what I say
Or I do when I talk intoxicated
Shorty say I told her I love her
I put her out the next mornin'
Sayin' bitch I must have been faded
I don't know what you heard about me
But the word about me is that I'm no trick
I'm no sucker, I'm no chump
I be in the VIP with my niggas 'round me
Sayin' y'all can have whatever you want
Me, I get it in, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty, give me a drink
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty, give me a drink
I hate to say I told you so
But I told you so, I go hard when it's time to play
Shorty get to droppin' it low
Like the dancers do in the Go Go in front of me
She know I like to see her dance
She get to breakin' it down, we get the bouncin' outta control
Because I got a hell of a flow
We got paper to blow my whole clique pop bottles galore
It's no secret the hood done peeped it
When we come through, son, we look like bread
My '89 grind make my old nine shine
Like we been movin' bricks 'round this bitch for years
I say, I get it in it's because I get it in
Now shorty there a eight but her friend near a ten
I finna spend my G, she fuck with me, I'm in to win
I'm cooler than her ma, then we do this shit again
Me, I get it in Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday

Na, na, na, na, now me, I'm the life of the party
A little bit of juice, little bit of the gin
A little bit of Moet, bottles of the Rose
Feel a little buzz then I'm gettin' it in
Now me, I get it in, I get it in
Me, I get it in, I get it in
Now me, I get it in, I get it in
Me, I get it in, I get it inIt's like an itch you can't scratch
It's like a bitch you can't shake
I still wanna
Sleeping with the finest, the thread count is bindless
Security blanket of cocaine, I am Linus
In this climate I'm Kareem Burke tied in
The Roc silent partner I ain't throwing up the diamond
Throwing on the shearling, collars up, bottles up
Sparkles to the table, got 'em feeling like he's Merlin
Whirlwind, powder makes your world spin
Learn from OGs, Alfa Romeos and Sterlings
Updated that, upgraded that
Suffocation blue in the insides potato sack
Yeah, talk money, shit I'm made of that
Cocaine parties like the seventies, I cater that
You know what fame is? Sitting with the woman
Of your dreams and forgetting what her name is
You know what pain is? Flushing two bricks
And tryna have a nigga strain it out the drainage
See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo
I still wanna sell kilos
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the pen begging for the Rico
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fish scale like I'm tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like you Tito
I still wanna sell kilos
Grew up watching momma car repoe'd
A little nigga staring through the peep hole
How you think I felt knowing daddy wasn't there
Recycling cans cause nobody ever cared
Get it how you live, always echoed in the streets
When we talking business, talking on the phone cease
Feds listening to conversations through my OnStar
Piecing puzzles together solving homicides of I's
Dice game chatter, better bring your stash out
Red velor, I'm in the white glass house
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
City of dope where real niggas sell yay'
Everyday a nigga dies and we can't ask why
Show 'em all love, the bitches fucked on the side
Tony Montana, tailor made suits in the church
Rolls Royce Corniche, trunk full of work
Testarossa top models, G fours
Gucci pass the crease off, everything I climb in, I win
Richard Mille Tourbillon, remarkable timing
Black label everything, logos in the lining
Bell Biv DeVoe push poison like a copper head
Powder falls, smoke clears through the walking dead
The Rose bottles pour for the champions
You'd think it was a Grammy win, celebration spills
Through the morning like an Ambien, bitches love my ambiance
Chain swinging, ticker taping like it's Mardi Gras
Thousand niggas deep, never needed body guards
Thousand keys that I'm about to do Pilate's on
Where the kings crowned like the grill a Maserati's on
Candy coated parked, doors ajar, on a stripper
Blew a fuse and caught a body on, cocaine storaging
Liva living dreams, y'all DeLoreans pouring in{Lyrics}
Never measure a man by his money but by his moves.... monkey
Get money homicide is what it comes with it
We da killas mufucka who you go get
I handle homos solo
So smooth not a wrinkle in my polo
Damn you ratted Preme
Damn near ratted on queens
Dont a ma'fucka love you
Its hard to findout your father was your uncle
This snitch infested with incest
Sold ten mill still not in the 10 best
And all you niggas look gay
Not even respected as a Red Cafe
You're not half of Jay Z
Not Nas fake Saigon maybe
On sight yall niggas gettin smacked
And dont forget the fact yall niggas all wack

Still hustle every day, who you rollin' with mane?
Knock 'em off the block Rick

Look in my face, better yet look in my eyes
Without a mask you lookin' at a big crook in disguise
Who cries when a sinner dies?
Four dead niggas in a ride, call it genocide
I rides for the enterprise
Million dollar ring, trynna shine 'till the end of time
Bought a Burger King with the bird money
Six months later Magic Johnson just heard from me 
Popped up in Atlanta
You can hear them chickens fighting from the truck of that Phantom 
Fuck a running shoot, look what I'm running through
All in a week's time, you can get a hundred too!
Roll with me shawty if you wanna eat shawty

Super head from Superhead, and I really will
Californication, motivation in my pocket
Got on my blue Dickie, shout out my nigga Roccett
Still smoking sticky, it ain't no other option
Not for made niggas and I'm never stopping
I raised the bar, I set the standards

Made niggas, talking a lotta skrill
Eight digits a nigga tryna live
Made man, you hear what I said
I got a hundred squares if you scared, called the feds
Made men, I'm screaming dollar bills
Pop the trunk on the Porsche, there they go, dollar bills
Riding round the city, plastic cup of Henny
Find a nigga like me, truth be told, I don't know many
I say shout my driver Lauren, that 62 with curtains
Can't see shit, I don't know where the fuck I'm at for certain
When it boils down, I'm just a T.O. nigga
But bitches tell me that I look just like a creole nigga
New Orleans know it's love, everytime I'm in town
Shout out my nigga Tez, that's my brother my round

Off the rack just ain't my style, I call it designer
One of my baddest women ever, I call her Rihanna
But that's cause her name is Rihanna!
I'm in the condo just posting watching Miami kill
I might just walk to the arena and watch it for real
Ashes to ashes, me, Rozay and Khaled
Smoking bull riders, shit moving slow as a ballad
Tattoo on your ass, it'd be nice if you show me
I'm buying bitches furs, Mike Tyson, Naomi

Love me some head, and I love a woman that likes to do it

Facing twenty, he just did a dime
Been out a year, look like he finna ride
Genocide, these people killing time
Throw you in a hole, you must be penalized
Soon as you see success, haters reinvest
Miami guns drive, half a million nothing less
Raised the bar, I set the standards
My yayo MC Hammer, that bitch just keep on dancing
Michael Jackson, let it moonwalk
Set it on the napkin, let it cool offParoles de la chanson Killswitch-Gunplay :
I'm sittin at the table, countin' my money
Ain't where I wanna be but I got a few hundreds
A lot of talk on the streets like a nigga crossin' me
Well, that's somethin' I gotta see
Is it how my chain swings? Tired of ma face
Tellin' lies, getting niggas wives tied up and raped
Similar to da mob, deeper than a rap
All you niggas gettin' robbed, all the cell phones tapped
Bullet in my head, bullet in my chest
Yeah, they want a nigga dead, they envy my success
To be loved, to be loved, oh what a feelin'
Hundred rounds in da drum
Niggas gettin whacked, no sympathy for the soft
Niggas snitchin', I know bitches who clippin' your dick off
I'ma boss champagne with the steak
Pink rose jay sittin' ace by da case
Brisco line, 2 young niggas, what it do
He gotta pretty shone and he wanna bring her through
That's love, we go back to the blue house
And if she bad enough, may take her to da new house
My Maserati be da new body
Got your girl panties wetter than a pool party
I got her sleepin' in the king size
Last night I had tha bitch sittin' ring side
You wanna go that route, go there
I been on this road before
I know gunplay, you know gunplay
I'm shootin for the win but ready for the loss
Both bags on the tip on my finger

When I'm swingin' dat iron
Ain't thinkin' 'bout time
Ain't thinkin' 'bout mine
Ain't thinkin' bout dying
My nigga so street, my swisha so sweet
All this money on the table, how a nigga gon' sleep
Speculations on my deal, it was over ten mil
Blowin' herb, chauffer plus home in New Zeal through
Beat the case like Gotti, we the Trill Murder Inc
I erased, slip and slide, they rainy in the mink
Look dead in her eye, it's da end of the road
In the purple Maybach means dat I'm getting' more dough
Smell the Christian Dior, I used to be poor
When you cross Florida lines, boy, I'm your leor
Boobi Boys steal, Boobi Boy's real
You can name a lot of lames that the Boobi Boys killed
Brisco line to young nigga, what it do

Fuck shit, ma nigga don't want this

You wanna go that route, go there

He helped the people give my dog a long returnIntro: Menace co.....
Verse 1:Rick Ross
Bump me in Fila, my mi-mind thinking in Creole
They call me the chef, you know I fry like Gruyère
Started learning the ropes
Sweat sous in the Lotus
Homie taught me to whip
So he made us a toast
They speak my name like a myth, when they got me a ghost
Picked him up in the sweep
They gave my-my mind the most
They be hard on real  gotta stay on my toes
They be watching my twitter, gotta watch what I post
Now it's all 'bout our killers, wrong one to approach
What you spent on ya' video, that went on a coat
Spent a million with Jacob, another several with Johnny
I mean look at the bezel, we got it looking Versace
Verse 2: Game
I AM, like Nas' album cover
28's powder covered

Be on my pimp shit like 19 72
World is my bathroom, I'm shitting, like Devon do

But I do door that Ghost
I stack two floors that loaf
I'll be 46 for that coach
I'll be 5/6 for that rope

Brother on your daddy's side now fucking your main bitch
Appeal been denied, no fulfillment in life
It's the life of the party popping pills in the night
Now it's 5 by 7, knives and weapons, lies and deception
Lose your life in this sector
See the game, what's the price
High rolling was the dice
Money like a motherfucker, shot 'em all night
Situation bad, pistol on his ass
Come up hard, we had to mash on the gas
Muscle was the come up, game was the struggle
Came from nothing, made something into bubble
Hit it real big just for the hustle
Got a lot of it on another level
The pressure's juice, what's the price, your loving life
We did it right and got rich up on the hot lights
Aren't you the hustle, new above the times
So we did it a little time, got back up on the grind
New about the soldiers, brace from the soldiers
Gave 'em all the game, how to be a high roller
Dump the fucking people with this presidential sight
Got a bitch that night, put her on the same flight
The same type of nigga that would put it in her life
Talk from the old G to head five stripes
You is just a fiend just like a dope fiend, shoot up in your veins
Lick it clean with a triple beam
Higher than life, lean on a candy slayer
Take a shot, what's jumping off the duffle bags
See the game, what's the price
High rolling was the dice
Money like a motherfucker, shot 'em all night
Situation bad, pistol on his ass
Come up hard, we had to mash on the gas
Muscle was the come up, game was the struggle
Came from nothing, made something into bubble
Hit it real big just for the hustle
Got a lot of it on another level
We the biggest hustlers in the game
