I hate these niggas, watch who you get close to 
You don't know my past, you don't know what I been through 
I been doin' scams, and stealin' what I'm used to 
Grew up too fast 
Watchin' niggas get blown back 
I just think you should know that 
Addiction came from my dad
So don't ask why I love poppin' pills 
I came from a place where this shit get real 
I was havin' troubles tryna find my next meal 
I felt so good when I signed my deal 
I brought all my niggas, everyone out the field 
I hopped in the stu' with the 5 on me 
I was finna show you what you was tryna see 
Picked me up when I was down, 'cause you down with me 
He said he was my nigga but he lied to me
So sad, so sad 
I hope that you know that, know that 
We all rich we glowin', glowin' 
Lil Mosey snowin', snowin' 
Celebrate with Moët, Moët 
Leave my pistol showin', showin' 
Let any nigga try me, try me 
Please don't get it by me, by me 
Walkin' through the thunder, feel like I'm goin' insane 
The only thing that's helpin' is these racks in the safe 
If you comin' with me, give me a reason for you to stay 
I stopped poppin' pills and switched to champagne 
I just booked a jet I'm tryna fly and go away 
Landed in Miami, 90 down the freeway 
I just lost my nigga, think about it every day 
Life is moving fast but I know I'm okay 
Uhh, uhh huh
Mhmm, uhh, uh-ohhYeah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, spendin' late nights at this motel
I feel like Dominic Fike, I hope she won't tell
'Cause I've been, all in my feelings over one girl
And I ain't sayin' nothin' 'cause I ain't gon' fail
Feelin' lonely don't cope well
That's why I'm always takin' bitches to the hotel
That's why I'm always in a Harrold's, shoppin' Moncler
'Cause I always throw money for a Joy bag
I thought money's what I needed
What's a million? But I still feel so damn needed
I throw money with success
The loyalty so rare, started to feel like an achievement
Will you be here when I need it?
Before I made it, they never popped out so frequent
Used to be known as the cheapest
But now I give a couple hunnid to my friends 'fore I leave them
Because of these days, I don't even come out on the weekend
And these days, bad lil' bitches in my DMs
And seems like now, everybody wanna see me
But for the wrong reasons, look, I'm still needed
Because of these days, I don't even come out on the weekend
And these days, bad lil' bitches in my DMs
And seems like now, everybody wanna see me
But for the wrong reasons, I'm so needed
Spendin' late nights at this motel
I feel like Dominic Fike, I hope she won't tell
'Cause I've been, all in my feelings over one girl
And I ain't sayin' nothin' 'cause I ain't gon' fail
Feelin' lonely don't cope well
That's why I'm always takin' bitches to the hotel
That's why I'm always in a Harrold's, shoppin' Moncler
'Cause I always throw money for a Joy bag
Yeah, I got these bands in my pockets, told 'em "Watch this" 
So many girls, I told 'em "Hop in" 
I ain't been broke in a minute so I'm wildin' 
Been a few years since momma was crying 
Stars in the Wraith, put the racks in the middle of us 
Ran down on him, stuck him up, told him, "Give it up" 
I can never trust a bitch, I never fell in love 
I don't got nothin' to say, I think I said enough 
I might fuck her and her friend 
I just spent as much as a band 
I ain't gon' lose I'm trying to win 
I'm gon' be the best before this ends 
I just did the whole year with no L's 
Niggas said they down to ride, I can't tell 
They wasn't there to pick me up when I fell 
You won't do whatever it takes, but I will
So lil' bad bitch, can you feel my vibe? 
Can you stay the night?
So lil' bad bitch, are you down to ride? 
Down to slide?
I need to know, I'm in need of it
Am I in need of you? I don't know no more
They always askin' what I see in you
But I don't see nothin', I don't know no more
I don't know what I see in you
But what I see in you is that you got no fault
And I don't know why I believe in you
But I believe in you and that's all I know
I know the bitches wanna be here
But they can't be in here, I don't got no home
I don't got no home
The reason I'm with you, I just don't know
Spendin' late nights at this motel
I feel like Dominic Fike, I hope she won't tell
'Cause I've been, all in my feelings over one girl
And I ain't sayin' nothin' 'cause I ain't gon' fail

Niggas always hatin' like we lucky
But I don't give a fuck, these bitches suck me
While I was just broke she screamin' fuck me
But I don't give a fuck, I pour the bubbly
My homie did the race, no one to stay with
But now we shop at Gucci making payments
G Taz in the cage, but he a stray nigga
, we okay nigga
If I could do it all again, I'd do the same
Cause if you ask around they know my name
And free my brother Taz, he let it bang
And my homie too, he let it sing
Started hittin' licks, no one was safe
Cause me, my niggas, love countin' on cake
Just yesterday we skipped another state
Blowin' up my phone, you too late
Me, my homie, laughin' to the bank
Cause we made it, give a fuck bout what you think
And I was dead broke, I'm too paid
And if you run up, you catch a fade
Niggas always hatin' like we lucky
But I don't give a fuck, these bitches suck me
While I was just broke she screamin' fuck me
But I don't give a fuck, I pour the bubbly
My homie did the race, no one to stay with
But now we shop at Gucci making payments
G Taz in the cage, but he a stray nigga

I be with my gang so you can get it anytime
I had to run up a check on 'em, a check on 'em
Had to put ice on and flex on 'em, and flex on 'em
Poured up a four of that Tek on 'em, that Tek on 'em
Had to put ice direct on 'em, direct on 'em
I had to run up a check on 'em, a check on 'em
I had to run up a check on 'em, a check on 'em
I had to run up a check on 'em, a check on 'em
I had to run up a check on 'em, a check on 'em
I just go a grind for a minute, but I'm back now
Ain't no one inside, I'm askin' niggas where they at now
Got it on my own 'cause nobody spend they max now
You was supposed to come but niggas talked me out my bag now
I'ma cop a new chain on 'em
Yeah, might go hit new stain on 'em
Yeah, might pull up like Gucci Mane on 'em
Yeah, might get bread like they ain't on it
Yeah, swear these niggas won't know what to say
Yeah, only talkin' beef behind they neck
We ain't in the lane, you not no threat
Yeah, bitch you broke, you probably in some debt
Yeah, I need that blue cheese, your bitch she on me
Put that shit in six speed like I’m fuckin' so deep
Bitch you don’t know me, I'm on my own thing
I don’t fuck with you, that's why I'm fuckin' swerving
I had to run up a check on 'em, a check on 'em
Had to put ice on and flex on 'em, and flex on 'em
Poured up a four of that Tek on 'em, that Tek on 'em
Had to put ice direct on 'em, direct on 'em
I had to run up a check on 'em, a check on 'em
I had to run up a check on 'em, a check on 'em
I had to run up a check on 'em, a check on 'em
I had to run up a check on 'em, a check on 'emLaying wake thinking how long its gon take
Every other day I just tryna count up this cake
People tell me slow down I moving too fast
But wait, I'm tryna get rich today
I pray to god when on he keep blessing me
Cuz the way things lookin I think its gon work out for me
But honestly I’m too impatient
And every time I move I be contemplating
Whether not I should load up a gun
Let it bust on a nigga
Or should I stay to myself
And let them keep disrepecting me nigga
Just to let you know
Should I chase the fast life
Forget about school 'cause I might but I fear my mother
Would be scared to hug me
Do you know how it feel
To go to sleep with half a mill
No water or power yeah you know the deal
They claiming support but don't really care
Tryna sell these takers so I can get up in the air
Do you got some change some spare
I bet you don’t
But that's at least what you say
If it don't benefit you, you say get out my way
But imma get it anyway
But I already know when it was good for me
You gonna wanna come my way
Ya see you didn't wanna help till u thought it was beneficial
Cuz now you see me wit bitches that blow the whistle
Ya niggas want war so Im shooting like a missile
Ya bitch I'm wit her
And niggas finna get mad when I push em out the picture
Just look they say I act abnormally different than the rest of my age
But all you gotta do is open your mind and turn the page
Continue on your path to be the best
And even when you tired you don't have time to rest
But you probably ain't even listen
Most you niggas claiming but then pay less attention
If you ain't helpin’ me you can go by your day
Most of you niggas won’t understand anyway

        Hmm, hmm
Ooh-uh, ooh-uh, ooh-uh
Yeah, I went to the year 2090 
See stars all day and they shine so brightly 
Everyone tryna rap just like me 
You don't understand what it might be 
So much things to modify and change you 
I just seen a real life space coupe 
In the sky, I just seen a real big high school 
And I seen you again and I still don't like you
Added three more hours to time 
And now they can read your mind 
Cars in the sky so there's no stop signs 
And a robot just gave me a ride 
Tryna tell you what we know 
2030, Rose missеd the winning free throw 
I might make a sеquel 
But they gon' tell me this illegal 
Yeah, I went to the year 2090 
See stars all day and they shine so brightly 
Everyone tryna rap just like me 
You don't understand what it might be 
Every single album I did went diamond 
Biggest in the world, tryna be me, keep tryin' 
Kanye West ended the virus 
I won an award for bein' an artist that's timeless 
Some people live on Mars 
Some people live on the Moon 
And once they go find a new universe 
'Cause the one that we live in got no room 
Tryna tell you what we know 
2030, Rose missed the winning free throw 
I might make a sequel 
But they gon' tell me this illegal 
Yeah, I went to the year 2090 
See stars all day and they shine so brightly 
Everyone tryna rap just like me 
You don't understand what it might be 
Yeah, I went to the year 2090 
See stars all day and they shine so brightly 
Everyone tryna rap just like me

Make cash, run it up, and spend it for no reason
I want everything around me every weekend
She said "I just want you", but I don't want you
Hundred mil', throw some racks, blew it 'cause I want to
They know it's me, when I pull up in a space coupe
They know they can't beat me so they would rather race too
You can't break my heart, 'cause it's already broken
Spend another bag, just to feel some emotion
I ain't left the house, yeah, I been coping
Percocet with the xan, yeah, I'm frozen
I been ballin' out already, no goalie
She tryna give me head, she off a bean, she rollin'
Everest on my neck, oh shit I'm snowin'
Oh shit I'm snowin, yeah
Fuck everybody, clothes worth a brick on my body
You know I'm the shit where's the potty
You know I got bands, that why she gonna top me

Pull up in a Beamer and I drop the top
They all been watching me, oh yeah

They said all I want is this, so can I see them?
Make cash, run it up, and spend it for no reason

All my money turned blue, yeah, be right there in a few, yeah, yeah
Go check, it be, yeah, 'cause I'ma come trip 'bout you, yeah

Got beef wit' niggas I ain't met and they all got stories on me that ain't true 
Yeah, I'ma buy that bitch, I'ma cop that bitch, I'ma stamp that, the whole purchase 
Nerds be up on ten sometimes I feel like the way it ain't workin' 
Had to play shit cool but I was up late night, talkin' 'bout myself hurtin' 
Don't know who might be against me, I just pray that that shit surface 
My drip from a whole new season , didn't even notice I was speedin' 
Hit the gas and got me speed demon , pull up on me but I bet you won't beat me 
Thinkin' 'bout that bag so much at night I was havin' trouble sleepin' 
Guess I'ma go hit Saks, 'cause I couldn't find shit up in Nieman's 
I'm so tired of talkin', got your text but I ain't even read it 
Gang up on my last brick, told him might need more, no he can keep it 
Restaurant cost so much they pull out the chair 'fore you even get seated 
Diamonds dance like Jackson, I told my nigga he could beat it
Baby if you want it, you got it

Only hit it back like two times 
Bitches all watching my tea time 
Twenty racks in my shoebox

Your bitch gave me good top 
Ran in his crib, lit two opps 
Big bag take lil' bank 
Too much racks, I need to be saved
Tryna fuck with me, it's too late 
No games, this is not EA 
Y'all niggas ride around in that Wraith 
Just wanna fuck, I don't wanna date 
Where I was broke, I could not wait 
I just finessed you out your wave 
He was acting pussy, beam him

I dropped fifty pints, that codeine rainin' 
Me and bro got two bad hoes, we flippin' places

Xanny for my lean, my vision lost off Excuse me, I cannot make this up
But do we have some chemistry or what?
Excuse me, do you really know what I mean?
You are way too much for me
Don't use me, my heart been through too much to confuse me
By the way, I feel from your touch
Excuse me, do you really know what I mean?
You are way too much for me
Ooh, my baby, you look so good
She said, "Who didn't do what they said they would?"
I'm sorry, but I know I can make it up to you
'Cause I know how I feel when I get next to you
Walk in the Louis and get whatever you want
I know money don't buy love, but I guess it's a start
I'll show you the life you want in your hеart
And you know I'm not done, 'cause I just made my mind
Ooh, hеar me to show me, I know you hate being lonely
Whenever you done, you say, "Hold me"
I got you
Excuse me, I cannot make this up
But do we have some chemistry or what?
Excuse me, do you really know what I mean?
You are way too much for me
Don't use me, my heart been through too much to confuse me
By the way, I feel from your touch
Excuse me, do you really know what I mean?
You are way too much for me

They ain't even did shit, thinkin' a opp was another guy 
I stayed by myself 'cause I was trusted to have a nigga time 
You sit by yourself tryna figure out another life 
You just know I've never been the same since my brother died
Took so many drugs, God, I let my brain get permafried 
Thе way my heart really don't work, got me tеrrified
How come at the funeral, the only time a nigga cried? 
Dang, you for real just for this life 'cause that's the usual
I just spend focus to show 'em how I got numerals 
Going for bigger things, this shit is not disputable 
I can't , 'cause all you niggas cubicle 
Stuck up in the studio, I come up, now racin'
Chasin', wonderin' how long my brother facin'
Hate this , told me I could see you being patient 
Fell in love with artificial 
My team harder than Globetrotters with coast, coast

This is my life, nigga it's the highlight 
Shawty tryna fuck me, I said, "Fuck me when the time right" 
Yeah, yeah, fuck me when the time right
She just want a nigga 'cause I'm stuck up in the limelight
Ooh, yeah, filled 'em

Ooh, shawty, look at that cake, yeah
Yeah, hop up in a coupe like what it do?Crazy 
You rockin' with me too, I pop a chopstick

Bad lil' thang, pulled up in a new rangе
She wanna play with me
Said "fuckin' do yo' thang"
Heard shе wanna ride wit' a real nig'
Smokin' drink, lean, poppin' pills, nig'
Aye, since a youngin', been a real nig'
Totin' straps, movin' shit, makin' deals nig'
Aye, for a real one, yeah, she movin'
For a real one, yeah, she movin'
For a real one, yeah, she movin'
Aye, for a real one, yeah, she movin'.............
You look so good, with no make up
But this ain't 
........................I don't know what you waiting for
In the deep I'm finna  this for
I do not want to play no more
If you keep the same games, I'm gone
Ballin' like 2k, I'm scorin'
I just  my cake, with  life's boring
Three or four ways, this going
Walk up in the place, and it's snowing
Hate me like this my favorite song
Bands in the middle of both of us
You can't even tell what we on
Woke up and made like twenty this mornin'
"Who said?", I say, "who said?"
If you really are slidin', drop the roof then
She like the gang, I said, "bandkids is the movement"
I might just swang with my chains, now they movin'
Thinkin' 'bout you, I've been thinkin' 'bout me
Girl, what you wanna do?
'Cause it's warm around me
Gang in the front, you can get in my street
And I hope you understand where you're supposed to be
So many flashing cameras
They see the lights on the phantom
When I pull out the mansion, they said they lovin' my fashion, uh
Girls havin' so much fun, diamonds on all of us
Man, I'm the chosen one
Never had help from no one
Tell me how something this great could've came so fast, would never guessed it
Never whippin' in the Lexus
Three or four grams, I'm finna neck this, uh
If you want racks, you better chase some
I was just broke, my money racin'
Now I'm in the hills, type famous
In the booth, making art, with the papers
Hate me like this my favorite song
Bands in the middle of both of us
You can't even tell what we on
Woke up and made like twenty this mornin'
"Who said?", I say, "who said?"
If you really are slidin', drop the roof then
She like the gang, I said, "bandkids is the movement"
I might just swang with my chains, now they movin'
Thinkin' 'bout you, I've been thinkin' 'bout me
Girl, what you wanna do?
'Cause it's warm around me
Gang in the front, you can get in my street
And I hope you understand where you're supposed to be
So many flashing cameras
They see the lights on the phantom
When I pull out the mansion, they said they lovin' my fashion, uh………………
I might just flex on the diamonds outside
'Cause you are  top now
Shawty said she want me but I’m up, my bae
Yeah, I think that’s just  now
Don’t know   the club
She ain't even think, she tryna fuck 
There she be rollin', get up
She give me, don’t touch me 
Bad bitch, you faded
Let me see what you waitin’ too
I’m faded, you faded

        Ughh
Sí, sí
Ayy Royce, lo hiciste aquí mismo
Estaba en la ruina ahora un joven negro flexionado
En un carril de conmutación extranjero no puedes ponerte al día
Lo odiabas pero cambiaste porque yo soy el siguiente
Me puse delgado y unos cuarenta en mi copa roja
Las perras cambiaron y actúan como si no me hubiera dado cuenta
Conseguir dinero negro, ese es mi enfoque principal
Ingenio .223 y actúas como si no supieras esto
Bro sacó un frijol, yo y mis niggas siempre rodando
Tu azada ajustando
Yo y KK Wok, siempre geekin '
Leakin, sí, mis cuatro patas dejan tu cuerpo goteando
Voy a correr en la carretera cada temporada 
Y solo cuento las bandas, mi cuello está congelado
Yo, JD, vinculado con South End, estábamos thuggin '
Fuera de las raquetas, aguantando el trabajo que ejecutamos 
Ahora contamos bandas, sí, mis niggas siempre pulgaron
Y no nos importa una mierda porque mis niggas siempre están tamborileando
Estaba mirando, tramando constantemente, pistola pisoteando
Mezclando frijoles con mi magro, esa mierda me hizo flotar
Estaba quebrado ahora estoy comiendo, con el estómago hinchado
Me enseñaron cómo flexionar
Nigga joven lo escribió 
Estaba en la ruina ahora un joven negro flexionado
En un carril de conmutación extranjero no puedes ponerte al día
Lo odiabas pero cambiaste porque yo soy el siguiente
Me puse delgado y unos cuarenta en mi copa roja
Las perras cambiaron y actúan como si no me hubiera dado cuenta
Conseguir dinero negro, ese es mi enfoque principal
Ingenio .223 y actúas como si no supieras esto
Bro hizo estallar un hombre de frijoles, mis niggas siempre rodaban
Solo era un joven negro esperando 
Pero ahora nos levantamos, no te preocupes, desvaneciéndonos
Jugando, juro estas perras, siempre juegan
Diciendo, me importa una mierda lo que dices
Creció en la avenida 50
Tweakers acostados al lado de amigo
Necesita un mayor ingreso
Así que me quedé tratando de venderte
Niggas siempre me prueba, así que me quedo con ese .32 
No puedes rodar con los hermanos y conmigo, porque vamos a explotar ese .22 
Si, tu sabes
Dije que sabes si
Me vuelvo la cabeza cuando, paso a través, sí
Sabes que estoy con el, con la tripulación, sí
Haga un círculo pequeño, así que solo es 2x2, sí
Estaba en la ruina ahora un joven negro flexionado
En un carril de conmutación extranjero no puedes ponerte al día
Lo odiabas pero cambiaste porque yo soy el siguiente
Me puse delgado y unos cuarenta en mi copa roja
Las perras cambiaron y actúan como si no me hubiera dado cuenta
Conseguir dinero negro, ese es mi enfoque principal
Ingenio .223 y actúas como si no supieras esto
Bro hizo estallar un hombre de frijoles, mis negros siempre rodabanMmh-hm
Doubled up my bankroll 
Gucci socks, my pants fall 
I bust down my ankle 
See you fuck niggas from my angles 
Doubled up my bankroll 
Gucci socks, my pants fall 
I bust down my ankle 
See you fuck niggas from my angles 
I just got a mill'
I feel like I won, won, won
Don't get yourself killed
We gon' get that shit done, done, done
You know I be in the field
See your ice we're gonna run, run, run
I just signed another deal
Put my shoes for some fun, fun, fun
Why you ringin' my phone?
Rollin' up, guess I'm gone
Damn that bitch she give me dome
Gotta leave her by the morning
I turned nothing into something
Yeah, all my niggas straight bossin'
Everyday I'm dumpin'
Pour a 4 or something 
Doubled up my bankroll 
Gucci socks, my pants fall 
I bust down my ankle 
See you fuck niggas from my angle 
Doubled up my bankroll 
Gucci socks, my pants fall 
I bust down my ankle 
See you fuck niggas from my angle 
Turn money to pesos 
Goin' somewhere you can't go 
She do what I say so 
In the rarri I race, ho' 
I do what I want (What I want
I buy what I want 
Bitch you need some cum 
Today I brought my gun 
Doubled up my bankroll 
Gucci socks, my pants fall 
I bust down my ankle 
See you fuck niggas from my angle 
Doubled up my bankroll 
Gucci socks, my pants fall 
I bust down my ankle 
See you fuck niggas from my angle 
Ugh
All angles
Yeah, Ugh-uh
