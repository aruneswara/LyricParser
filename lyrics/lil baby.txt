Lil' nigga, but I'm big, dawg
All I gotta make is one call
Hit a nigga block, took off
Cross a nigga up, Hot Sauce
Ooh, I got 'em mad, my fault
Talkin' 'bout the shit that I bought
Poppin' these Percs, I done turned to a savage
Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress
Hundred racks stuffed in the attic
Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangster, but they won't approach me
I know they'll never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet
I rock the gang to the fullest
I run with some real ones, I don't hang with no pussies
I ain't no killer, don't push me
I see how you niggas be lookin'
I hope you don't think you no bully
I'm livin' the life, I should star in a movie
Ridin' in a Vert with an Uzi
12 get behind me, I lose 'em
They tryna guess what I'm doin'
They tryna guess who I'm screwin'
That ain't even they business
They ain't wanna fuck with me
Now they see a nigga drippin'
Now they wanna fuck with me
They can't get in touch with me
Hardly ever in the city
They just know I'm gettin' bigger
They just know a nigga busy
I been runnin' up them digits
YeahProtests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd 
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here

I bring up money, they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
She gave me her number, now I gotta block it
I'm mixin' the dirty bills in with the profit
Clean that shit up and I give it right back to him
If I don't fuck with him, then I can't rap with him
I wanna be there when somebody catches him
I want a witness to see that shit
Man, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap
I bring up hits and they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
One hell of a year and a nigga still droppin'
They wanted to stop it, but they couldn't stop it

Cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
Virgil just chef'd me a whole different colorway
Please don't be stupid, it's Baby and Gunna
And Baby, he wanted her, so I just swung her
Next time I'm in Dallas, I'll look for another
You niggas fell off and you'll never recover
Poured up some Hi-Tech and wait 'til it bubble
Young Gunna Gunna, I make this shit double
Hit Eliantte and left with a puddle
It's me, Drake, and Baby, you know you in trouble
Run up my check, my bitch sprinted the shuttle

Painted all black, the interior butter
I drip like a leak and that's word to my mother

Family a beast, we gon' eat us a supper
My dick in her mouth like she teethin' or somethin'
Sound like it could be Drip Season this summer
Ain't no comparin' 'cause we number one
In black and white Chanel, I look like a nun
The police in shock, don't know who got a gun
Don't got what I got 'cause I shop in Milan
It's winter, I still took the top off the don
The kid was surprised that my trunk in the front
I know you a upset they don't shine in the sun
Cuban link look like a box of crayons

By the time she get back, I'ma switch up my number
Cap to her friend like I been on her bumper
Lately, I been the topic of discussion
Draco was foreign, they shipped it from Russia
Bad vibes at my show like I'm Usher
If she tell me "No" once, I won't even touch it
All I do is get her out here, abortion
Act like I've been rich, I used to have nothin'
Drizzy hit me up like he got another one
Money ain't even came in from the other one
Fuck it, I'm hot, so I might as well double up
Seem like everything I get on a number one
They tryna team up to beat me, they huddlin' up

Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet

And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', "Baby, please"
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny

I'ma shoot at your body, won't aim for your neck
I just cashed out on a flooded Patek
It ain't a big one, but dammit, it's big enough
I just came home from the can, I'ma live it up
I rep the gang, when you see me, I'ma throw it up
I just spent three hundred racks on a Bentley truck
Screamin' out, "gang, gang, gang, gang, gang"
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane
Gotta maintain, can't go back broke
Gotta stand tall, won't bend or fold
Drop top 'Vette, tryna keep it in a Rolls
Ain't signin' no deal, ain't sellin' my soul
Gotta run it up fast, my mama gettin' old
I'm a million dollar nigga, gotta reach my goal
Got the hood on my back, still throwin' up fours
They say the Act gettin' low, I'm still pourin' up fours
I pour the six if it cost me
I like to fuck on your ho on the balcony
I got the cheese and I got me some broccolli
All color money, this shit like monopoly
Can't get this drip, ain't no need for you watchin' me
I ran my racks up and I moved out of poverty
I'm keepin' designer all over my body
I got some Buscemi, I got new Givenchy
Damn I thought I'd never see the day
I'm so glad I made it through the rain
They don't wanna see a nigga straight
They don't wanna see young Gunna paid
Take a long time, I had to wait
Want this penthouse, a lot of space
A lot of hundreds comin' our way
Bust it down, split it with the gang
Screamin' out, "gang, gang, gang, gang, gang"
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane
I used to sleep on the floor for a mattress
Getting evicted, that shit was embarrassing
My mama didn't have it, we made us a palettes
I had to share with the roaches and rats
Keep gettin' money these voices keep telling me
I went to prison, it made me a better me
I can't get no job, I got too many felonies
I been on probation since I was like seventeen
I done got me some stripes in the hood like a referee
I used to walk into school with that fire on me
I'm gettin' money, ain't really got time to beef

I don’t know nothing ’bout no killin', all I know is murder beats
I got rich and understand my next three cars gon’ be a lease
I ain't never losin' sleep about no beef, I roll in peace
I put diamonds in my teeth, came from grindin' in the streets
Get a load and break it down and sell it all and then repeat it
Pray to God for all the dawgs behind the wall, they need they freedom 
When I be on TV and perform, I hope they see me 
Once it's up, it's stuck, we get over on niggas, not get even
Forgiato rims on my dually, I ride diesel
Only rock Amiris with my team, not no Diesel

I'm just tired of my kind gotta be the one to die
Lookin' in the sky, I know you with me, I can't cry
Standin' what I stand on, I can't never switch sides
Sometimes I just wanna pop out on 'em and flip by
But I put my head on, I pray, I stay from off the route
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas, I ain't seen 'em in a while
Thinkin' 'bout my son, I just had another child

If we in this together, this the way it 'posed to feel
I'm going out with a bang, I'm tellin' you what it is
If I get racial profiled where I live
'Cause my crib bigger than theirs, or my cars up to date
Or it's probably be my girl shape, they probably wanna date her
Or they heard I got my cake up, middle finger to them haters
My life finally matters, I got up and I'ma stay up
I know it lookin' like a dream, but it ain't everything it seem
Ain't no tellin' where I be if I ain't have God or ain't have my team
Can't let 'em trick me out the streets, I got a mind of my own
I left the house at sixteen, I told my Mama, "I'm grown"
Been through a lot of situations, I can handle my own
If I had only one call, I know you pick up the phone
If they ain't with us, we gone
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah

Folks give yo ass that time, you'll never see the outside
All you do is think and wonder why
Kiss the good life goodbye
Now you gotta fight to survive, ain't no guns all you got is knives

Young niggas gone on the ice
Grown men fucking grown men they'll never tell you that part

Caught a few cases, I been on the road but overall a nigga still free
I done been robbed I know how it feel, a nigga gon' have to come kill me
I been through it all, I came this far how a nigga not gon' feel me
Ain't no facade, no cap in my raps everything that I say is the real me
I give all my problems to God
Let him handle all my enemies
I get on my knees and beg him please I just hoping that he hearin' me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get ahead of me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get the best of meCook that shit up, Quay
I can't fuck with shawty, know she’ll tell
Slim shit, look like Draya Michele
I been goin' crazy, givin' ’em hell
She ain't tryna go with me, I'ma pay her
I crush a lot, baby girl, I'm a player
Connect the dots then I plug up the scale
If we get caught, they gon' give me the chair
Fuck the law, make 'em earn what they pay 'em
Ain't no back and forth with no bitches, this ain’t tennis
Rolls Royce truck, bitch, it ain’t rented
And they braggin' ’bout bitches, I promise we hit 'em
I flooded my wrist, let the bros split a million
At this point I'm heartless I ain't got no feelings
Buy every building in the hood for my children
Like a Drake song, got your vibe feelin’ groovy
With no phone, we can make us a movie
I ain't in my bag, I still got my feet out
If we wanted smoke with y'all, you couldn't be out
Free the bros, buy my shit off the kiosk
I'm at the vibe with the spot, this the creep house
Lil' shawty suck it like she just took her teeth out
Five percent tint on the whip, you can't see out
Ready to set it off, Queen Latifah
These niggas talk like bitches, see what they be 'bout
I can't fuck with shawty, know she'll tell
Slim shit, look like Draya Michele
I been goin' crazy, givin' 'em hell

If we get caught, they gon' give me the chair
Fuck the law, make 'em earn what they pay 'em
Ain't no complaining, money coming in
Put it all up, do it all again
First you get a mil', then it's times ten
Youngest out the crew, AMG Benz
Stand up like a man, take it on the chin
They got consequences in this life of sin
Laugh about it, go in Gucci, spend a ten
When you come home, we gon' all win
Go in any club and make it thunderstorm, this shit reckless
He gon' knock you off with his Rollie on
Drive the Rolls Royce like a hotbox, really came from nothin'
Only ride with my security because I can't be armed
Can't get caught with another gun
They gon' know me when I'm gone
They hear my pain inside my songs
It's like a switch, I cut it on
Pills kick in, gettin' in my zone
Do my job, ain't see no wrong
I'm never talkin' on them phones
Feds gon' try to do us wrong
Man, they got my nigga Long
Lately I just been alone
My cup, my strap, this microphone
Nobody know what's goin on
Just glad I made it off the road
Granddaddy showed me life is a gamble
Ever since I been on them dice
They gon' suck it up like a bowl of rice
I'ma give it to them niggas every time
I can't fuck with shawty, know she'll tell
Slim shit, look like Draya Michele
I been goin' crazy, givin' 'em hell
She ain't tryna go with me, I'ma pay her

If we get caught, they gon' give me the chair
Fuck the law, make 'em earn what they pay 'emAh-ah-ah, hey
Run that back, Turbo
You niggas bogus, I see the imposers
I used to sell yola, trap on Motorolla
Spittin' these vocals, labels think I wrote it
Slippery wet paints, the coupes are candy-coated
Just left the bank, I need a bag to hold this
The streets like a farm 'cause all we ride is horses
Let my face tell it, we done made a fortune
I'm ridin' with my dawg and he ain't gotta question
I got a bitch like Keisha off of Belly
Police got dogs and they can't even smell me
Keep me a cup, I got a lean belly
20s on me, I call 'em green relish
Balmain my jeans, if not, they embellished
Too many vibes, they think I'm R. Kelly
PH in the sky, we got 'em already
PJ in the sky and I don't wanna land it
Creepin' at night, the VLONE bandit
I prayed to the sky and none of this was handed
Worked all my life and now I understand it
Crawled up like a mouse, but I could never tell it
I got the sweetest sauce like jelly
Try disrespect me, you all get beheaded
I got the drip, they call me Dripavelli
I held him down, that nigga was my celly
Fuck you fuck niggas, devil made me heartless
Thank God, came and got me, used to shop at Target
They cut out the coupe before we hit the market
We don't pack our bags 'cause we gon' shop regardless
Backend, I'm back in, paid up for the party
I done came a long way from openin' up for Carti
Shades and my bracelets Cartier Carti
Police's cases, all that we avoidin'
The lean in my cup gettin' more and more muddy
I shown all my love, I've never been a bully
Got every color VLONE hoodie
Just jumped in the game and still I ain't no rookie
I got this sauce, cream and puddin'
I came with the drip, got everybody lookin'
Cherish your blessings, easily could be tooken
Send a front in, it's easy to get a book in
You niggas bogus, I see the imposers
I used to sell yola, trap on Motorolla
Spittin' these vocals, labels think I wrote it
Slippery wet paints, the coupes are candy-coated
Just left the bank, I need a bag to hold this
The streets like a farm 'cause all we ride is horses
Let my face tell it, we done made a fortune
I'm ridin' with my dawg and he ain't gotta question
Yeah, cash all my backends, I bought me a Patek
Addicted to cabbage, the money relax me
My mom and them happy, I bought them a mansion
I still rock the fitted, but I don't be cappin' 
These camouflage denim like I just went campin'
They still can't believe that I made it, they happy
I been gettin' money before I was rappin'
I'm ridin' in the Wraith like I play with the actors
No pleadin', arraignment, ain't takin' no charges
My young nigga's solid, I know that he got me
He keep his mouth closed, I'ma buy him a foreign
Penthouse, hotel suite whenever we're tourin'
How foreign my tint is, I still rock the Jordan
Packin' out shows, love my fans, they important
And I'm still in the trap, in the hood like a motor
Spend thousands on fragrance, she fuckin' my odor
I just started rappin', I made me some millions
Man, shout out Atlanta, I'm runnin' my city
These bracelets came healthy, they cost me a 50
I leveled it up, I've been handlin' business
Gettin' 20 a night, every day, different city
I just keep puttin' this syrup in my kidneys
This the big one, boy, this not the Jubilee 
I got Gunna with me, rockin' VLONE, Supreme 
You niggas bogus, I see the imposers
I used to sell yola, trap on Motorolla
Spittin' these vocals, labels think I wrote it
Slippery wet paints, the coupes are candy-coated
Just left the bank, I need a bag to hold this
The streets like a farm 'cause all we ride is horses
Let my face tell it, we done made a fortune
I'm ridin' with my dawg and he ain't gotta question I told her to fly and she scared of the virus, I sent her a private to get here
I made four hundred dollars off of each of these pounds, I ain't trippin', it's gon' be a good year
Solomon drivin' while I got my hands on the chopper, I'm keepin' my eyes in the rearview
I'm from Atlanta where they pay to triple cross niggas, they'll dap you up, then they'll kill you
These niggas fake and I'm real, I don't feel 'em
My niggas takers, ain't worried 'bout 'em stealing
I run with apes and some baby gorillas
I know a few , I can buy me a nigga
Said I wouldn't change but my change a lil' bigger
Four-carat ring leave a scar if I hit you
Look like a spaceship, got stars in my vehicle
These niggas fake and I don't wanna deal with 'em all
I'm social distancing
Man, these niggas can't touch me, I can't get sick
Good excuse for me to pour up medicine 
She say I ain't got no heart and I'm devil-sent
I'm on some savage shit, ah
I got the drop on the opps, switched the cars
I got a hundred inside of a drum
We pull up clapping, a round of applause
We just gon' say that they won the award
Slide in the daytime, then come back at night
We gon' make sure that nobody play with us
They make me mad, I'ma turn up
Let's talk about money, I swear I been savin' up
I'm really sick with this shit, got 'em throwin' up
He hit a lick for a brick, now he goin' up
My niggas rapping, you see us, we blowin' up
Hit the bitch for a rack, then ignore her
I'm so sick of these rats and these whores
I might marry my girl and just go away
Eat her out if she rich, got expensive taste
We ain't got rush, told the pilot to fuckin' wait
Ain't no way I can go on no fuckin' date
I don't know her and she don't know me
My lil' boy 'dem turnt up at a young age
You can say that it run in my genes
I'm social distancing
Man, these niggas can't touch me, I can't get sick
Good excuse for me to pour up medicine 
She say I ain't got no heart and I'm devil-sent

Started with a penny, now it's racked up to a million 
Rappin' rappin' niggas can't compare, they like my children 
I know bitches tryna get to know a nigga 'cause his digit
You a Honda Civic whipper, in my  chameleon 
We should start a group and we can call it New Edition
Maybe we can do it different, prolly make a hundred million 
I come from a place between the bricks where it was hard at 
Whenever I ain't around they talkin' 'flauge, I had to fall back
Wrist a Honda Civic, Lamborghini arms 
We get plenty pussy , nah-nah-nah-nah 
Don't you call me with it 
Boss nigga, we don't talk 'bout chickens , nah-nah-nah-nah
My Rolls Royce in the projects, they look at me like I'm God
Don't ask me 'bout no such-and-such, don't speak about no charge
I just stack my money different, every ten go in a rubber band
Too much attention on these rappers, fuck it, we gon' whack their man
Some shit I don't understand, I go get it, I never ask
I don't condone that robbin', but if you slime, suggest you wear a mask
Treat my niggas and my bitches all like players, buy 'em all bags
Wish I would've answered for the homies that I can't call back
Started with a penny, now it's racked up to a million 
Rappin' rappin' niggas can't compare, they like my children

I come from a place between the bricks where it was hard at 
Whenever I ain't around they talkin' 'flauge, I had to fall back
My dawg just lost his dawg into the system, it got me fucked up
I can't tell him nothin' negative, so I told him he gon' luck up
Had a bittersweet birthday, got a bad call in a Rolls truck 
Red guts look watermelon and spaghetti and some ketchup 
All my niggas leavin' me, this shit got me depressed 
Thought he was gon' wreck the Maserati or the 'Vette
But he on the yard with the old dawgs, they a wreck 
I missed a court call, what they said?
No more fake text messages, leave 'em all on read 
And this game some bullshit, but they payin' so I play it 
Cartier earrings, act like I don't hear what they be sayin' 
Keep that shit too solid, I spent millions on my family 
None of that shit promised, I pay cash, I take chances 
I don't understand nothin', I don't want no advance
Blood on these diamonds, they look good, they dance
Big truck pull up like a blue ambulance
Started with a penny, now it's racked up to a million 
Rappin' rappin' niggas can't compare, they like my children

Whenever I ain't around they talkin' 'flauge, I had to fall backI been the type of guy she like since middle school
Never thought that I'd get famous, always know that I'd be cool
Could've been fucked on shawty, I just didn't wanna be rude
Eliantte diamonds, I want the finest for your jewels
And my hitter 'dem be slidin', don't put cameras on my crew
I ain't doin' too bad, I'm somebody, you can Google me
I ain't never worried 'bout what they say that they gon' to do me
I just put in overtime, I'm doin' numbers like it's two of me
That was back then, times change, this a newer me
Money conversations at the table, I speak fluently
Stay away from bad vibes, I can't see no nigga doing me
Still give a couple thousand, even though she would of did it free
They don't treat me like no rapper 'cause my vibe like I'm in the streets
I'm one of the top five, it ain't too many guys as real as me
I barely get sleep, I'm tryna make sure everybody eats
Took a trip to overseas, I'm buyin' drip in other currencies
I'm on fire right now, and it ain't somethin' that's just currently
And a bitch told a lie if she told you she was curvin' me
And we all big dawgs, ain't gon' let my people work for me
911, we got a problem, it's an emergency, yeah
I heard that crime pays 
They think we thugs 'cause we got ice, I'm going plain jane
No matter what, at least a quarter for my main thing
Showed up on Forbes, I can't complain, I'm tryna maintain

Have you runnin' 'round in laps for me
I perform, when I'm done, you should clap for me
You got problems on your head, you can chat with me
Have you runnin' around the globe chasing racks with me
M's in plastic, sometimes I'm sarcastic
I just like to hear laughter, tryna ease all this pain
Took off fast, I know they hate how I passed 'em
Don't gotta be in the grave, they throwin' dirt on your name, yeah
I heard that crime pays, uh
They think we thugs 'cause we got ice, I'm going plain jane

I asked you about it, you lied
You asked me about it, I kept it one hundred, I'm nothin' like these other guys
I really spent two thousand on kicks and only wear 'em one time
Something about a nigga mind frame
Diamonds doing jumpin'-jacks in the AP, I can make the time change
Two hundred hoes in my call log and I ain't got not a name saved
Took her out the hood, put her on the drip, now I got her rockin' name brand
Me and Ced had two different spots, we usually around the corner doin' the same thing
Everywhere I go my chains hang, free the bros out the chain gang
New Maybach cost 230, I don't even get my shoes dirty
I don't even sleep when I get tired, you can see the Adderall in my eyes
Tiger said he got the drop on the opps
Fuck it slide and shoot up the block

You niggas can't keep up with my guys
You can't get all this drip in a lifetime
I got out and ran it up at the right time
We got Dracos whenever it's nighttime
We ain't ever gonna stop at the stop sign
Went to Wafi, I told 'em I want to shine
Then the coupe quarter million, they wiped me down
I'm running this town, everything I say facts niggas can't take that
New Lamborghini 18'
Only thing I do is make cream, I don't why these niggas hating
Only thing I do is drink lean, rest in peace to Fredo Santana

Show me loyalty, I'll let you ride 
Just sip codeine 'cause I just gotta get high 
I'm savin' my cheese 'cause we done had hard times 
Flew to Belize, I needed a peace of mind

Feds tryna listen in on me, think I'm a drug lord
Had to make it to the finish line without no head start

Bought all this water, I'm never gon' drown

I helped 'em out and they let me down again
I ain't comin' back around again
Fell in love and I found a friend

I done ran the money all the way
I been home 120 days
I been home 120 days
I been home 120 daysDon't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
Yeah
Clothes busted, nose dusty, watch the older bros hustlin'
Started off wrong, but you couldn't tell me I ain't know nothin'
All I ever want was to put on and give my folks somethin'
Knockin' on my sister window, comin' in at 4 somethin'
Mama trippin' 'bout the way I'm livin' and how my hoes comin' 
Caught the next-door neighbor slippin', we slimed him, left his nose runnin' 
Knowin' I can't lie, so when she asked me, I  make no comment
Terrorizin', thuggin', doin' dumb shit, makin' no money
It was time for me to go up, got a pack and made it blow up
Went into that corner store until I got it all
Know I skipped a couple parts, but I can't never tell 'em all
But the moral of the story, I got it all out the mud
The way karma make me feel, I swear I think I'm in love
Been fuckin' strippers since I was lil', fell in love with the club
Bruh gave me everything I need, knew what to say to the plug
I got my hands on a few mil', but shit, it still ain't enough
It's like my life is like a dream, but I'm still here when I wake
I'm gon' get everything I need, I'll do whatever it take
I caught a case, ran, got away, I should've jumped in the lake
I thought about it the other day when I slid through in the Wraith
Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game
Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain
Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name
Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game
Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain
Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name
Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
Bad bitch, we both young
They say that I'm cheatin' and we both dumb
But Baby got her wrist hittin', both arms
G-Wagen and Range Rover, both of 'em
If we love forever, you get new homes
I just wish that other **** could move on
She proud to be rockin' that new two-tone
My life goin' good, why would I do wrong?
I'm livin' my best just like Lil Duval
I didn't get the message, and it's screw y'all
I don't want no issues, can't be beefin' with my family
I don't want no problems, just make sure my kids can count and read
And it ain't no pressure 'bout the money, I won't even see it
It's bigger, it's the principle, I hope one day that you can see
We got a whole seed to raise, it's bigger than you and me
How I'm not gon' do that? I spend millions on my jewelry
The only reason I'm mentionin' it is 'cause I'm tired of this foolery
I'm just emptying my thoughts, I can't keep 'em in a box
Ain't no hard feelings at all, I want everyone to ball
Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game
Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain
Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name
Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game
Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain
Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name
Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
I said I don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explainDJ Paul

First of all, you know I bang 4's 
Never met JAY-Z, but in my hood I'm like Hov 
Everyday a holiday, my lifestyle goals 
Everything white and rose, I don't really like gold 
Came through in the Maserati , knew I was gon' get it poppin'
Serve a nigga in every hood, Baby good with everybody 
With no understanding, I ain't planned, let's get it clarified
I just spent a hunnid on a chain and didn't care about it
Try me, they gon' hear about it, make a call to every side
Drop a bag and air 'em out, get the drop on every house
Nah, I'm really playin', I'm just sayin', I don't play at all
I been in the field for so long, but I ain't playin' ball
Choppa chop his hand off, found the plug and ran off
Think I need a agent the way I play it, call up Rich Paul
Never fold and never forget the code, you better stand tall
I done put them bags from Gresham Road to West End Mall
Try and knock your mans off, I know it's too much tension with you bitches 
Niggas better stick to rappin' 'fore I click and get to trippin'
I got double-digit millions, and I still be with the killers 
Boy, I gotta be the realest livin', can I get a witness?  
Nobody ain't stressin' on my side 
4PF the gang and niggas know how we gon' ride
Couple choppas, couple stolen cars, it's time to slide
I hope the cameras don't catch the tag, and if they do, we'll be alright

Took a trip to the Barbados, and I'm still on paper
Shout out to my haters, they been motivating me lately

Solid niggas turned fake, seen it happen every day
Didn't expect it to happen, I thought you was solid
Still can't believe you not right here beside me
The money in front me, the bullshit behind me
My nigga forever, I thought we was riders
When we caught them cases both of us kept quiet
I just lost a friend to some gun play
Put my main bitch on the runway
Still servin' packs on the one way
Paying tithes Sunday, we gon' blow up one day
Magic on a Monday, shout out to the strippers
Lately I been feelin' it on another level
Savin' all the extras, I gotta be different

Just like Frito-Lay, I'ma feed my friends
Got white like Nicky Barnes, cop these two door foreigns

Don't approach, I'm armed, flawless diamond charm
All my spots alarmed, big house feel like a dorm
It's on the north, young Gunna don't love no whore
I came with the wave no shore, my voice a little hoarse
I'm whippin' around in a Porsche, I'm ballin' outside of the court
Never knew I could make it in sports
Jumped in that Benz, then I peeled off
Brought out a ten, I'ma spend it all

Need to free my dawg, he's locked behind the walls

Paid cash for all my cars, protected but I'm raw
Addicted to the awe, me and Gunna double R
Rich rollin', I'm a star, don't take shots from the bar
But I'm ballin' like Lavar

Either you gon' hustle or you rob
Never had no hoop dreams, but I always wanted to ball
Ever since a jit I knew I was gon' be rich
Never thought it'd be like this

I know Ray Charles had it good, he ain't never had to see a homicide
Stevie Wonder ain't see his brothers die, he ain't feel my pain
He don't know my mama couldn't pay the light bill and I felt that pain
But Mark had died, he wasn't breaking a dollar, but I tried to help him change
Interrogatin', I still wouldn't crack if I was on cocaine
Got this shit from out the projects, ain't no silver spoons
The morning after the night we slide only time we watch the news
I wanna comment on niggas' picture, but I just keep it cool

When I was runnin' through the street, it was on curfew
And all them times I had him down, I could've murked you
Before I went and did my time in the feds

We stopped goin' to football practice, we found another way to score
See I'm tired of seein' my niggas in dirt, but they ain't from Chicago
And Billy died sober shootin' dice, hear what I'm sayin', I'm hollow
And my niggas went to snortin' coke, I remember pourin' up in Fanta
Asking God why that cat geeked, I don't never get no answers
I be wantin' to get my bros out that slammer, but they ain't like Tyson Chandler

I got a new Benz, worth three-hundred
But I had signed a deal, for some shit you won't believe
I got needs, family in need
Teach them do's and don't's
Show 'em right from wrong
Give 'em money every time they ask
Knowing that I got an extra for they ass
Know that I'll be there when they count
I don't write checks that bounce
I don't write checks at all
Cash on all my cars
I 
I don't give a damn who care
Niggas got M's everywhere
I'm just tryna stay on top
Confidence I'm never gon' flop
People having hate in they heart
I can hear it when they talk
Know they talk bad but nothing right
Never have this fame tear me down
They tryna make me something I'm not
They gon' never 
Kept it real with all my fans and now I'm large 
Kept it real with all my niggas from the start, this ain't no new beginning
Thousand dollars on denim, we finally winning, I'm thanking God 
I got the squad with me
I got the squad with me
4 by 4 truck, pull up big as fuck
Ain't never had shit, now a nigga mad rich
I always thought I'd get a mil', I ain't never think about three or four
Now the money going up now , up now 
I put diamonds on my teeth like I'm from uptown 
Now she tryna come around and let me fuck now 
I done gave 'em my all only to get let down 
Only to get let down 
Way I'm running with that sack, might score a touchdown
And when I Come back with that pack, gon' buy a bustdown
For running quick
4 by 4 truck, pull up big as fuck
Ain't never had shit, now a nigga mad rich
I always thought I'd get a mil', I ain't never think about three or four
Now the money going up now , up now 
I put diamonds on my teeth like I'm from uptown
Now she tryna come around and let me fuck now
I done gave 'em my all only to get let down
Only to get let downYeah, yeah
Got my waves from the block
Not my dad, no shame on my pops
Tryna change the game and how I rock
My son be saying Glock
My mans still selling weed but he ain't me so I can't tell him stop
Then again I'm happy its just weed and he ain't selling block
Young, rich, and black hopping out Maybachs
Build my catalogue up get some artists so I can lay back
Thought I was dumb but I got too much sense under this A hat
Answer every call I know its hard I told him we gonna shake back
All the shit we done when we was young I'm guessing this is payback
Heard they give you deals for meals somebody tell me where I pay at
Heard you still be in the field been here for years this where I'm safe at
Me, God, and Ben Frank' the only ones know where my safe at
Fuck all that being calm I bought a foreign its on the way back
Had a spot on every street it ain't no condo we ain't play at
In your heart know I'm the one seem like your tongue won't let you say that
We gonna fire all our arms this your warning nigga stay back
Baguetti spaghetti all on my arm I used to starve
M in my garage I really used to steal cars
Petty shit don't bother me I know I was gonna go far
Only thing that bothers me is my sons without their fathers
Im just being honest
Never show no feelings about money thats a women's trait
My momma good, my sister's good, I turned up my whole fucking hood
