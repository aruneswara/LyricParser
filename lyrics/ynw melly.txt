Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it

I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him, "It's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye"
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt
Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind

And that 40 make a nigga levitate, hey, hey
And they have me locked up in the level 8, hey, hey
It's some angels with me and they really ridin' for me
It's some demons with me and they really dyin' for me
Run up on my nigga, swear to God we playin'

Oh you ride for me? Say you gon' ride for me
My lil' nigga gon' slide for me, yeah they gon' slide for me
I know my slime gon' ride for me, yeah they gon' ride for me
I know my twins gon' ride for me, and they gon' die for me
It's some angels with me and they really ridin' for me
It's some demons with me and they really dyin' for me
Run up on my nigga, swear to God we playin'

Gotta tone down this song, and put on your thongs
Ima give you my all
First question that I gotta ask
Have you ever made love to a street nigga?
Ima beat that thing up how I beat niggas
Long strokin' Ima make that pussy speak to me
Little whisper in your ear, baby speak to me
We been rollin' all night can't keep jiggin'
I done roll too many kites, can't keep lookin’
Would you still hold it down? Let them crackers cook
