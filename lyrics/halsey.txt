Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said "be true," I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I, him and I
My '65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride
They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide
2017 Bonnie and Clyde
Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my 
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince 
Cross my heart, hope to die 
To my lover, I'd never lie 
He said, "Be true," I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love; the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
In the end, it's him and I
We turn up, mobbin' 'til the end of time
Only one who gets me, I'm a crazy fuckin' Gemini
Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I-
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together , fuck up clubs together 
And we'd both go crazy  if we was to sever
You know?
We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch
Fuck the world, we just gon' keep getting rich, you know?
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said "be true," I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love; the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
In the end, it's him and I
Cross my heart, hope to die
To you, I've never lied
For you, I'd take a life
It's him and I, and I swear 
'Til the end I'ma ride wit' you
Mob and get money, get high wit' you, yeah 
Cross my heart, hope to die
This is our ride or die
You can confide in me
There's not no hiding, I swear
Stay solid, never lie to you
Swear, most likely I'ma die wit' you, yeah
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said, “Be true,” I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I

Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah
In the end, it's him and IFound you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close 
I was afraid to leave you on your own 
I said I'd catch you if you fall 
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all 
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries 
Just runnin' from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine 
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind
Said I'd catch you if you fall 
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all 
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah
You don't have to say just what you did 
I already know 
I had to go and find out from them 
So tell me, how's it feel? 
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why Uh
Yeah, yeah
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough 
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus 
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
17, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned 23
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
Run away now, run away now
Run away now
Run away now, run away now
Run away now
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't setYour little brother never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I'll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old
You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue
You were a vision in the morning when the light came through
I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you
He said, "You'll never be forgiven 'til your boys are too"
And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you
You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue
You were red, and you liked me because I was blue
But you touched me, and suddenly I was a lilac sky
Then you decided purple just wasn't for you
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blueGot a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love 
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one 
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love 
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one 
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love 
I'm bad at love 
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades
Each time the feeling fades
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades
You know I'm bad at love 
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one 
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love 
Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love 
Oh, ohI wanna start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest 
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret 
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way
No, you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so fucking far
That you would never ever touch me again
Won't see your alligator tears
'Cause know I've had enough of them
I'm gonna start this out by saying 
I really meant well from the start
Take a broken man right in my hands
And then put back all his parts
But you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
Oh, I feel so sorry 
I feel so sad 
I tried to help you 
It just made you mad
And I had no warning 
About who you are 
Just glad I made it out without breaking down
Oh, I feel so sorry 
I feel so sad 
I tried to help you 
It just made you mad
And I had no warning 
About who you are 
'Bout who you are
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah
Hey-ey-ey-ey, yeah
'Cause you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
I feel so sad
You should be sad
You should be
You should be sad
You should be
You should be
You should beNow I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors
"Come on, little lady, give us a smile"
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be
"Come on, little lady, give us a smile"
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'd rather be a real nightmare, than die unaware, yeah
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'm glad to be a real nightmare, so save me your prayers
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a nightI've missed your calls for months it seems
Don't realize how mean I can be
'Cause I can sometimes treat the people
That I love like jewelry
'Cause I can change my mind each day
I didn't mean to try you on
But I still know your birthday
And your mother's favorite song
So I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind
Ooh ooh oooh
I run away when things are good
And never really understood
The way you laid your eyes on me
In ways that no one ever could
And so it seems I broke your heart
My ignorance has struck again
I failed to see it from the start
And tore you open 'til the end
And I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind
And someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind
And someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me
And someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't meAre you insane like me? Been in pain like me?
Bought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me?
Just to pour that motherfucker down the drain like me?
Would you use your water bill to dry the stain like me?
Are you high enough without the Mary Jane like me?
Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?
Do the people whisper ‘bout you on the train like me?
Saying that "you shouldn't waste your pretty face" like me?
And all the people say
"You can't wake up, this is not a dream
You're part of a machine, you are not a human being
With your face all made up, living on a screen
Low on self esteem, so you run on gasoline"
I think there’s a flaw in my code
These voices won’t leave me alone
Well my heart is gold and my hands are cold
Are you deranged like me? Are you strange like me?
Lighting matches just to swallow up the flame like me?
Do you call yourself a fucking hurricane like me?
Pointing fingers cause you'll never take the blame like me?
And all the people say
"You can't wake up, this is not a dream
You're part of a machine, you are not a human being
With your face all made up, living on a screen
Low on self esteem, so you run on gasoline"
I think there’s a flaw in my code
These voices won’t leave me alone
Well my heart is gold and my hands are coldHave you ever fallen head over heels for somebody?
Not just somebody
No, no
Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody
That made promises to give you the world? Um
I really hope they held you down
I really hope it was no lying
'Cause when heart breaks it feel like the world's gone
But if the love's real, you'd feel your soul roar like a lion
And you'd finally let bygones be bygones
Don't throw in the towel, I know it feels like you're the only one trying
You just gotta learn to live and love on
I belong with the one put on this Earth for me
Everybody has their someone, just gotta look and see
I'm screaming out, "Lord, help me, I've been lonely"
That's when you accept me, then you set me free
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Uh, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love didn't click
Searchin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Yeah, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love ain't click
Lookin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Been pretty fuckin' bad, but it's better now
Through the trials and tribulations, I found my way out
Feel all of the good and bad vibrations all around
All around us, they surround us
Was a lost cause with some lost love
It ain't my fault, pain chose us
Then I found her
My whole world turned upside down, uh
But for the better
I belong with the one put on this Earth for me
Everybody has their someone, just gotta look and see
I'm screaming out, "Lord, help me, I've been lonely"
That's when you accept me, then you set me free
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Uh, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love didn't click
Searchin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Yeah, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love ain't click
Lookin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Thank God I finally found you
You put the light in my eyes when I'm around you
I'm too flawed to hold you down, but
Don't wanna be here alone
And I thank God I finally found you
I'll put the light in your eyes if I'm allowed to
I'm too flawed to hold you down, but
Don't let me be here aloneIf I

I stayed a night out in Paris where they don't know my name
And I got into some trouble with that drink in my veins
I got a problem with parties 'cause it's loud in my brain
And I can never say sorry 'cause I won't take the blame
I know I always go missing and you're lying awake
But if you ask why I'm distant, oh, I'm running away

We've been through it all
But you could never spit it out for me

But you could never tear it down for me, yeah
Never pick up, never call me
You know we're runnin' out of time
Never pick up when you want me

I want you to love me now, now, now, now, now, now
Now or neverYour eyes, so crisp, so green
Sour apple baby, but you taste so sweet
You got hips like Jagger and two left feet
And I wonder if you'd like to meet
Your voice is velvet through a telephone
You can come to mine, but both my roommates are home
Think I know a bar where they would leave us alone
And I wonder if you'd take it slow
Oh, we're dancin' in my living room, and up come my fists
And I say I'm only playing, but the truth is this
That I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified, but I can't resist
And I said
Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
And I hope, beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms
But I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally, finally safe
For me to fall
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
I grab your hand and then we run to the car
Singing in the street and playing air guitar
Stuck between my teeth just like a candy bar
And I wonder if it goes too far to say
I've never recognized a purer face
You stopped me in my tracks and put me right in my place
Used to think that loving meant a painful chase
But you're right here now and I think you'll stay
Oh, we're dancin' in my living room, and up come my fists
And I say I'm only playing, but the truth is this
I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified, but the truth is this
I said
Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
And I hope, beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms
And I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally, finally safe
For me to fall
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, I think it's finally, finally, finally, finallyShe doesn't kiss me on the mouth anymore
'Cause it's more intimate, than she thinks we should get
She doesn't look me in the eyes anymore
Too scared of what she'll see, somebody holding me
When I wake up all alone
And I'm thinking of your skin
I remember, I remember what you told me
Said that we're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
We're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
She doesn't call me on the phone anymore
She's never listening, she says it's innocent
She doesn't let me have control anymore
I must've crossed a line, I must've lost my mind
When I wake up all alone
And I'm thinking of your skin
I remember, I remember what you told me
Said that we're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
We're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
I miss the mornings with you laying in my bed
I miss the memories replaying in my head
I miss the thought of a forever, you and me
But all you're missing is my body, oh
Said we're not lovers 
'Cause we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
We're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all 
To feel anything at all
To feel anything at allI, I know where to lay
I know what to say
It's all the same
And I, I know how to play
I know this game
It's all the same
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone new
Would've gave it all for you, cared for you
So tell me where I went wrong
Would've gave it all for you, cared for you
Would've traded all for you, there for you
So tell me how to move on
Would've traded all for you, cared for you
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone new
He don't realize that I'm thinkin' about you
It's nothing new, it's nothing new
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone newMy demons are begging me to open up my mouth
I need them
Mechanically make the words come out
They fight me, vigorous and angry
Watch them pounce
Ignite me
Licking up the flames they bring about
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He’s got me down on both knees
But it’s the devil that's tryna...
Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Selfish
Taking what I want, and call it mine
I’m helpless
Clinging to a little bit of spine
They rush me
Telling me I’m running out of time
They shush me 
Walking me across a fragile line
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He’s got me down on both knees
But it’s the devil that's tryna...
Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down now
Hold me down now
Hold me do-o-o-o-own
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He’s got me down on both knees
But it’s the devil that's tryna...
Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live forSick of all these people talking, sick of all this noise
Tired of all these cameras flashing, sick of being poised
Now my neck is open wide, begging for a fist around it
Already choking on my pride, so there's no use crying about it
Agnus dei
Agnus dei
Agnus dei
Agnus dei
I'm headed straight for the castle
They wanna make me their queen
And there's a old man sitting on the throne there saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle
They’ve got the Kingdom locked up
And there's the old man sitting on the throne there saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
Straight for the castle
Oh, all these minutes passing, sick of feeling used
If you wanna break these walls down, you’re gonna get bruised
Now my neck is open wide, begging for a fist around it
Already choking on my pride, so there's no use crying about it
Crying about it
Crying about it
Crying about it, about it, bout it, bout it
I'm headed straight for the castle
They wanna make me their queen
And there's an old man sitting on the throne saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle
They’ve got the Kingdom locked up
And there's a old man sitting on the throne there saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
Straight for the castle
There's no use crying about it
There's no use crying about it
There's no use crying about it
There's no use crying about it
I'm headed straight for the castle
They wanna make me their queen
And there's the old man sitting on the throne there that's saying that I probably shouldn't be so mean
I'm headed straight for the castle

And there's the old man sitting on the throne there saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut

I'm headed straight for the castle
They’ve got the Kingdom locked up
And there's an old man sitting on the throne there saying I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut
Straight for the castleThey sent me away to find them a fortune
A chest filled with diamonds and gold
The house was awake, with shadows and monsters
The hallways, they echoed and groaned
I sat alone, in bed till the morning
I'm crying, "They're coming for me"
And I tried to hold these secrets inside me
My mind's like a deadly disease
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?
I paced around for hours on empty
I jumped at the slightest of sounds
And I couldn't stand the person inside me
I turned all the mirrors around
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?
I'm well acquainted with villains that live in my bed
They beg me to write them so they'll never die when I'm dead
And I've grown familiar with villains that live in my head
They beg me to write them so I'll never die when I'm dead
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
God damn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?I'm searching for something that I can't reach
I don't like them innocent, I don't want no face fresh
Want them wearing leather, begging, let me be your taste test
I like the sad eyes, bad guys, mouth full of white lies
Kiss me in the corridor, but quick to tell me goodbye
You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?
You're a Rolling Stone boy, never-sleep-alone boy
Got a million numbers and they're filling up your phone, boy
I'm off the deep end, sleeping all night through the weekend
Saying that I love him but I know I'm gonna leave him
You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?
I'm searching for something that I can't reach
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?I'd like to tell you that my sky's not blue, it's violent rain
And in my world, the people on the street don't know my name
In my world, I'm seven feet tall
And the boys always call, and the girls do too
Because in my world, I'm constantly, constantly havin' a breakthrough 
Or a breakdown, or a blackout
Would you make out with me underneath the shelter of the balcony?
'Cause I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
Wish I could see what it's like to be the blood in my veins
Do the insides of all of my fingers still look the same?
And can you feel it too when I am touchin' you?
And when my hair stands on ends, it's saluting you
The blush in your cheeks says that you bleed like me
And the 808 beat sends your heart to your feet
Left my shoes in the street so you'd carry me
Through a breakdown
Through a breakdown or a blackout
Would you make out with me on the floor of the mezzanine?
'Cause I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
My face is full of spiderwebs, all tender, yellow, blue
And still with one eye open, well, all I see is you
I left my daydreams at the gate because I just can't take 'em too
Know my heart still has a suitcase, but I still can't take it through
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
I don't need anyone 
I don't need anyone 
I just need everyone and then some 
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I just need everyone and then some
Oh-mmm, oh-mmm Sittin' on the counter in your kitchen
Can you hear my heartbeat fucking kickin'?
Your eyes light up 'cause you best believe that I got something up my sleeve
I walk my talk, no time for wishful thinking
I push up on my toes, you call me "sweet thing"
I'm breathing down your neck, your body screaming
And you thought that you were the boss tonight, but I can put up one good fight
I flip the script like I can take a beating
And when you start to feel the rush
A crimson headache, aching blush
And you surrender to the touch, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding, oh
And when you start to look at me, a physical fatality
And you surrender to the heat, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding
This is Heaven in hiding, oh
Sitting on the concrete in your basement
But I don't have no time for conversation
Said this ain't what you usually do, and a girl like me is new for you
And I can tell you mean it 'cause you're shaking
And when you start to feel the rush
A crimson headache, aching blush
And you surrender to the touch, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding, oh
And when you start to look at me, a physical fatality
And you surrender to the heat, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding
This is Heaven in hiding, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And when you start to feel the rush
A crimson headache, aching blush
And you surrender to the touch, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding, oh
And when you start to look at me, a physical fatality
And you surrender to the heat, you'll know
I can put on a show, I can put on a show
Don't you see what you're finding?
This is Heaven in hiding
This is Heaven in hiding
This is Heaven in hiding, oh
Oh, this is Heaven in hiding
This is Heaven in hiding
'Cause I'm Heaven in hidingThere's a place way down in Bed Stuy
Where a boy lives behind bricks
He's got an eye for girls of eighteen
And he turns them out like tricks
I went down to a place in Bed Stuy
A little liquor on my lips
I let him climb inside my body
And held him captive in my kiss
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
I went down to a place in Brooklyn
Where ya tripped on LSD
And I found myself reminded
To keep you far away from me
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I'm a hurricane
He says, "Oh, baby, beggin' you to save me
Though lately, I like 'em crazy
Oh, maybe, you could devastate me
Little lady, come and fade me"
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
Come and fade me
Come and fade me
I'm a hurricaneI'm 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?
I think I missed you callin' on the other line
I'm just thinkin' all these thoughts up in my mind
Talkin' love but I can't even read the signs
I would sell my soul for a bit more time
You stain all on my body like you're red wine
You're the fuckin' acid to my alkaline
You run your middle finger up and down my spine
I'm sorry there was no one to apologize
I'm so fuckin' sorry, I'm so fuckin' sorry
I've been playing somebody and it's helping nobody
And her lipstick arithmetic didn't stick
And now I'm sick, throwing fits
And yeah, I've seen you in my head every fuckin' day since I left
You on the floor with your hands 'round your head
And I'm down and depressed
All I want is your head on my chest
Touchin' feet in my bed
I'm 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?
You're 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
You're 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?
Tell me what you need
I can make you more than what you are
Come and lay the roses on the floor
Every single Sunday, don't get bored
I just want to freeze
I can give you more than what you are
Now I see you standing all alone
I never thought the world would turn to stone
So call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fuckin' with my head
Call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fuckin' with my head
I'm 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?
You're 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
You're 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?
So call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fuckin' with my head
Call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fuckin' with my head
You're 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
So why aren't you here?
Why aren't you here?
Why aren't you here?
Why aren't you here?
Why aren't you here?Wanna believe, wanna believe
That you don't have a bad bone in your body
But the bruises on your ego make you go wild, wild, wild, yeah
Wanna believe, wanna believe
That even when you're stone cold, you're sorry
Tell me why you gotta be so outta your mind, yeah
I know you're chokin' on your fears
Already told you I'm right here
I will stay by your side every night
I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
Ah
I know you need, I know you need
The upper hand even when we aren't fighting
'Cause in the past, you had to prepare every time, yeah
Don't wanna leave, don't wanna leave
But if you're gonna fight, then do it for me
I know you're built to love, but broken down, so just try, yeah
I know you're chokin' on your fears
Already told you I'm right here
I will stay by your side every night
I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
Ah
I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair
Going sick in the head, tryna get you there
And I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair
It's not fair
I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
Ah, ah
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
AhWell, King Midas put his hands on me again
He said one day I'd realize why I don't have any friends
I find myself alone at night unless I'm having sex
But he can make me golden if I just showed some respect
But I don't let him touch me anymore
I said, "I'm not something to butter up and taste when you get bored
'Cause I have spent too many nights on dirty bathroom floors
To find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door"
He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"
He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"
And now I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything
You wrote a hundred letters just for me
And I find them in my closet in the pockets of my jeans
Now I'm constantly reminded of the time I was nineteen
Every single one's forgotten in a laundromat machine
But I don't let him touch me anymore
I said, "I'm not something to butter up and taste when you get bored
'Cause I have spent too many nights on dirty bathroom floors
To find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door"
He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"
He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"
And now I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything
And I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything 
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything
He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"
He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"Standing now, in the mirror that I built myself
And I can't remember why the decision wasn't mine
But it seems I'm only clingin' to an idea now
Took my heart and sold it out to a vision that I wrote myself
And I don't wanna be somebody in America just fighting the hysteria
I only wanna die some days
Someday, someday, when I burst into flames
I'll leave you the dust, my love
Hope a bit of it'll be enough to help remember the
Days when we came to this place
I told you I'd spill my guts, I left you to clean it up
I'm bursting out of the
Seems like now it's impossible to work this out
I'm so committed to an old ghost town
Is it really that strange if I always wanna change?
And if only the time and space between us wasn't lonely
I'd disintegrate into a thousand pieces
Think I'm makin' a mistake, but if I decide to break
Who will fill the empty space? So...
Now, if I figure this out
Apart from my beating heart
It's a muscle, but it's still not strong enough to carry the
Weight of the choices I've made
I told you I'd ride this out
It's gettin' harder every day
Somehow, I'm burstin' out of myself
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or
I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive
I'm just a fucked up girl who's lookin' for my own peace of mind
Don't assign me yoursI really was born at 9:29 AM on 9/29
You think I'm lying, but I'm, I'm being dead serious 
Okay, I'll prove it
Well, who am I? I'm almost 25
Can't remember half the time that I've been alive
'Cause half was in a cheap apartment
And half was on the Eastside 
They said don't meet your heroes, they're all fuckin' weirdos
And God knows that they were right
Because nobody loves you, they just try to fuck you
Then put you on a feature on the B-Side
And who do you call when it's late at night?
When the headlines just don't paint the picture right
When you look at yourself on a screen and say
"Oh my God, there's no way that's me"
And I, I quit smoking, well recently, I tried
And I bought another house, and I never go outside
And I remember this girl with pink hair in Detroit
Well, she told me
She said, "Ashley, you gotta promise us that you won't die
'Cause we need you," and honestly, I think that she lied
And I remember the names of every single kid I've met
But I forget half the people who I've gotten in bed
And I've stared at the sky in Milwaukee
And hoped that my father would finally call me
And it's just these things that I'm thinkin' for hours
And I'm pickin' my hair out in clumps in the shower
Lost the love of my life to an ivory powder
But then I realize that I'm no higher power
That I wasn't in love then, and I'm still not now
And I'm so happy I figured that out
I've got a long way to go until self-preservation
Think my moral compass is on a vacation
And I can't believe I still feed my fucking temptation
I'm still looking for my salvation
Soft and slow, watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself
Watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself
I think I have a confession to make, I feel like 
I need to say that I was really born at 9:26
It's on my birth certificate, I'm a liar
Man, I'm a fucking liar
Soft and slow, watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourselfDarling, I've just left the bar
And I've misplaced all my credit cards
My self-preservation and all of my reservations
Are sittin' and contemplating what to do with me, do with me
Think I took it way too far
And I'm stumblin' drunk, getting in a car
My insecurities are hurtin' me
Someone please come and flirt with me
I really need a mirror that'll come along and tell me that I'm fine
I do it every time
I keep on hanging on the line, ignoring every warning sign
Come on and make me feel alright again
'Cause it's 3 AM
And I'm callin' everybody that I know
And here we go again
While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone
And yeah, I'll take fake moans and dial tones
Let 'em spill right down the microphone
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone
And every night, I wanna live in color through a white-blue screen
I got a technicolor vision going vivid in my white-blue jeans
I know it's complicated
'Cause everyone that I've dated says they hate it
'Cause they don't know what to do with me, do with me
Know that my identity's always getting the best of me
I'm the worst of my enemies
And I don't really know what to do with me
Yeah, I don't really know what to do with me
I keep on hanging on the line, ignoring every warning sign
Come on and make me feel alright again
'Cause it's 3 AM
And I'm callin' everybody that I know
And here we go again
While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone
And yeah, I'll take fake moans and dial tones
Let 'em spill right down the microphone
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone
I'm reckless, treat it like a necklace
Take a different version and I try it on for size with everybody that I know
And will you please pick up the fucking phone?
'Cause it's 3 AM
And I'm callin' everybody that I know
And here we go again
While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone
And yeah, I'll take fake moans and dial tones
Let 'em spill right down the microphone
I need it digital 'cause, baby, when it's physical
I end up alone, end up alone

Your, your best song is a song that's currently on the radio
How many people can say that?
That their best song is the one that's currently about to be a massive hit?
It's already a hit, it's just gonna get more massive
How many people can say it? Not very many
Congratulations!Ah-all I ever wanted
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close 
I was afraid to leave you on your own
I said I'd catch you if you fall 
And if they laugh, then fuck ’em all 
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin’ so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
Gave love ’bout a hundred tries 
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made ’em mine 
I didn't notice ’cause my love was blind
I said I'd catch you if you fall 
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all 
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me
Tell me, how's it feel sittin’ up there?
Feelin' so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah
I'm sad inside, but I know it's for the best, right?
You had to realize where you drew the line
I would cross the line a thousand times
You've got what I need, bae, I need your spotlight
Along the lines of social suicide, I refuse to die not by your side
So I'll take what I can from you, then I'll hide
And save the "Lucid Dreams" for another time
I still hate it when you're not there
I know I should, I know I should, but no, I don't care
I still hate it when you're not there
This life's not fair, took advantage of that
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there? 
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me 
You know I'm the one who put you up there 
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely? 
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know whyDo you remember the taste of my lips that night
I stole a bit of my mother's perfume?
'Cause I remember when my father put his fist through the wall
That separated the dining room
And I remember the fear in your eyes
The very first time we snuck into the city pool
Late December, with my heart in my chest
And the clouds of my breath
Didn't know where we were running to
But don't look back
Oh, we'll be looking for sunlight, or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
But for now let's get away
On a Roman holiday
Could you imagine the taste of your lips if we never tried to kiss on the drive to Queens?
'Cause I imagine the weight of your ribs if you lied between my hips in the backseat
I imagine the tears in your eyes
The very first night I'll sleep without you
And when it happens I'll be miles away
And a few months late
Didn't know where I was running to
But I won't look back
Oh, we'll be looking for sunlight, or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
So for now let's get away
On a Roman holiday
Feet first, don't fall
Or we'll be running again
Keep close, stand tall
Oh, we'll be looking for sunlight, or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
But for now let's get away
On a Roman holidayAnd down came your innocence
A shining badge, a suit to match
Bit my nails down so they wouldn't scratch
But who believes with knees like these?
I'll take two of 'em, please
With soft skin, soft eyes
All these beautiful laughs and beautiful thighs
They always kept me up at night
But I can't change my appetite
'Cause your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be a better man
It doesn't matter to me
Your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be a better man
It doesn't matter to me
'Cause he is she is her
And her and he are love
And I have never felt the difference
'Cause he is she is her
And her and he are love
Tired of all these labels
And my girl, she always wore a skirt in the classroom
Eatin' my dessert in the bathroom
Can't get caught, so we stiller than a statue
Bad news, think I'll probably die before I have you
Soft skin, soft eyes
All these beautiful laughs and beautiful thighs
They always kept me up at night
But l live for lovin' impolite
'Cause your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be a better man
It doesn't matter to me
Yeah, your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be a better man
It doesn't matter to me 
'Cause he is she is her
And her and he are love
And I have never felt the difference
'Cause he is she is her
And her and he are love
Tired of all these labels
'Cause he is she is her
And her and he are love
And I have never felt the difference
'Cause he is she is her
And her and he are love
Tired of all these labelsOh
Breakfast is cold, as cold as our bed
I'm watching you choke down the words that you said
I watch you devour, mistake me for bread
Well boy, is you fed? Or are you misled?
I gave you the messiest head
You give me the messiest head
Oh, you're turnin' red
'Cause I'm tryna give the impression that I get the message you wish I was dead
See you 'bouta break a sweat 
I won't let us finish yet 
Please don't take this as a threat 
All I'm sayin' is if you don't love me no more, then
Lie, lie
Lie, lie
I heard what you said 
You talk about your head game 
I know that it's fire flame 
Your mouth make a hurricane 
You notice that we in love 
That's something we cannot change 
It's the plans we should arrange 
Treat her right and she won't complain 
Bring back the title 
She tall like the Eiffel 
Got no one to lie to 
There's no need to lie no more 
Bring me a trial 
Every move's vital 
What you gon' die for
When everything you told lies? Alright
Lie, lie
Lie, lie
Lie, lie
Lie, lieBeen about three days and I'm comin' back
I'm about four minutes from a heart attack
And I think you make me a maniac
But you don't know, oh
Two years and we in between
But we both been here since we seventeen
Here we go, fist fight in a limousine
But they don't know
And we both hope there's something
But we bo-both keep fronting
And it's a closed discussion
And I'm thinking, "Damn, if these walls could talk"
 Well, they'd be like
 "Shit is crazy, right?"
 "That ain't your baby no more"
Been about two weeks since you went away
I'm about halfway through a Cabernet
There I go, I'm wastin' a Saturday, sittin' at ho-home
Told my new roommate not to let you in
But you're so damn good with a bobby pin
Now you gon' play me like a violin, hittin' these notes
And we both hope there's something
But we bo-both keep fronting
And it's a closed discussion
And I'm thinking, "Damn, if these walls could talk"
 Well, they'd be like
 "Shit is crazy, right?"
 "That ain't your baby no more"
 Hey
 No more
 "That ain't your baby no more"Alone out in Saint-Tropez
Lookin' as fine as a damn Monet

Everybody thirsty, drinks on me
When I'm out, clothes on lay away
Tryna take back what you say to me
I don't give a damn what you say to me
There ain't no time for games with me
I'm moving on, I'm getting paid
I'm on my own, I had some space to deal with it
I'm moving on, it's getting late
Go and grab someone and find a place to deal with it

Double cuppin' in the ride
Motherfucker, don't play with me
Motherfucker, don't play with me
Motherfucker, don't play with me

Runnin' lines like a marathon
Got it all white like parmesan
I am not the type to be out past dawn
Tomorrow got a flight headed to Taiwan
Now you know where the bottle gone
Drippin' so wet with the Pérignon
I am not the type to admit I'm on
How could I lie when we sip so strong?
I'm moving on, I'm getting paid
I'm on my own, I had some space to deal with it

He says, "Ooh, baby girl, you know we're gonna be legends
I'm the king and you're the queen and we will stumble through heaven
If there's a light at the end, it's just the sun in your eyes
I know you wanna go to heaven, but you're human tonight"
And I've been sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool
For a while now, drowning my thoughts out with the sounds
But do you feel like a young god?
You know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
And they're running, running, running
But do you feel like a young god?
You know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
And they're running, running, running

He says, "Ooh, baby girl, don't get cut on my edges
I'm the king of everything and oh, my tongue is a weapon
There's a light in the crack that's separating your thighs
And if you wanna go to heaven, you should fuck me tonight"

If we fucked on the bathroom sink
How your hands felt in my hair
If we were high on amphetamines
And everybody wants to hear
How we chain-smoked until three
And how you laughed when you said my name
And how you gripped my hips so mean
We wrote a story in the fog on the windows that night
But the ending is the same every damn time, no, no, no
We wrote a story in the fog on the windows that night
But the ending is the same every damn time
They think I'm insane, they think my lover is strange
But I don't have to fucking tell them anything, anything
And I'm gonna write it all down, and I'm gonna sing it on stage
But I don't have to fucking tell you anything, anything
That's the beauty of a secret
You know you're supposed to keep it
That's the beauty of a secret
Oh, wa-oh, wa-oh, wa-oh, wa-oh
That's the beauty of a secret
You know you're supposed to keep it
But I don't have to fucking tell you anything, anything
Everybody's waiting up to hear if I dare speak your name
Put it deep beneath the track, like the hole you left in me
And everybody wants to know 'bout how it felt to hear you scream
They know you walk like you're a God, they can't believe I made you weak
We wrote a story in the fog on the windows that night
But the ending is the same every damn time, no, no, no

But I don't have to fucking tell you anything, anythingMy hands wrapped around a stick shift
Swerving on the 405, I can never keep my eyes off this
My neck, the feeling of your soft lips
Illuminated in the light, bouncing off the exit signs I missed
All we do is drive
All we do is think about the feelings that we hide
All we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
Sick and full of pride
All we do is drive
And California never felt like home to me
And California never felt like home
And California never felt like home to me
Until I had you on the open road and now we're singing
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah
Umm.. Hey, I was just wondering if you wanna like… never mind. Thank you. Bye...
Your laugh echoes down the highway
Carves into my hollow chest, spreads over the emptiness
It's bliss
It's so simple but we can't stay
Over analyze again, would it really kill you if we kissed?
All we do is drive
All we do is think about the feelings that we hide
All we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
Sick and full of pride
All we do is drive
And California never felt like home to me
And California never felt like home
And California never felt like home to me
Until I had you on the open road and now we're singing
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ahI've been trying all my life
To separate the time
In between the having it all
And giving it up, yeah
Ayy, 내 머릿속엔 파란색만 가득한 이 방황
자기혐오들과 자만이 내 마음속에 살아
꿈이 가득한 난 자라 모든 꿈을 이뤘건만
꿈은 꿈으로만 간직하는 게
더 낫지라는 생각을
동시에 하며 살아가고 있지
내 도약은 추락이 아니기를
너의 신념 노력 믿음 욕심들은
추악이 아님임을 믿어 ayy
해가 뜨기 전 새벽은 무엇보다 어둡지만
네가 바란 별들은 어둠 속에서만
뜬다는 걸 절대 잊지 마
I been trying all my life
To separate the time
In between the having it all
And giving it up, yeah 
I wonder what's in store
If I don't love it anymore 
Stuck between the having it all
And giving it up, yeah 
가끔은 내가 걷고 있는 게 맞는지
하염없이 터널 끝을 향해 달리면
뭐가 또 있을런지
맞긴 한지 내가 바라던 미래와는
솔직히 다른 거지
상관없지 이제는 생존의 문제
어찌 됐든 상관없지 yeah, yeah
네가 바란 것들과는 다를지 몰라 
네가 살아가는 것도 사랑하는 것도 변할지 몰라 
That’s true 
 Yeah, so, are you gonna move?
꾸물거리기엔 우린 아직 젊고 어려 부딪혀보자고
So what you gonna do?

Back in my hotel and I'm alone inside, oh
'Cause you know the truth hurts, but secrets kill
Can't help thinkin' that I love it still

You're my best friend, and I wanna help you
But I won't let you kill again
That's a lose-lose
Told me pick my battles and be pickin' 'em wise
But I wanna pick 'em all and I don't wanna decide
No more, no more, anymore
So we'll sneak in in the back and then we'll kick in the door
Tell me, have you ever keyed a Ferrari before?
Oh no, I don't anymore
And I'm not breakin', I won't take it
And I won't ever feel this way again
'Cause you don't need me anymore, woah
And I won't ever try again
And all I want in return is revenge
'Cause I don't need you anymore, woah
So where do you go?
Pull up to the drive and I remember the codes
Yeah, the only fuckin' numbers you don't hide in your phone
No more, no more, anymore
Climb up to the window and I'm breakin' the glass
Then I stop, 'cause I don't wanna Uma Thurman your ass
No more, no more, anymore
And I'm not breakin', I won't take it
And I won't ever feel this way again
'Cause you don't need me anymore, woah

Woah, woah, woah, oh, oh
And I don't need youOh, oh
Yeah
I should be living the dream
But I'm livin' with a security team
And that ain't gonna change, no
I got a paranoia in me
And you wouldn't believe
Everything that I seen, no
Comin' apart at the seams
And no one around me knows
Who I am, what I'm on
Who I've hurt and where they've gone
I know that I've done some wrong
But I'm tryna make it right
To the one I love, bring me 'round
Get me out right now 
And know that I love you
But I'm still learning to love myself
I'm still learning to love myself
 Yeah, yeah
I should be living the dream
But I go home and I got no self-esteem 
You think I'm swimmin' in green
But it's passed around my family tree
No man wants to really commit
Intimidated 'cause I get paid and shit
In the crowd, you're readin' my lips
But no one around me knows
Who I am, what I'm on
Who I've hurt and where they've gone
I know that I've done some wrong
But I'm tryna make it right
The same mistakes on and on
To all my friends, I'm sorry for
And know that I love you
But I'm still learning  to love myself
 Yeah, yeah
I'm still learning  to love myself 
 Yeah, yeah 
Oh, I try and I try to remember sometimes
If I breathe, it's alright, but some things don't change
I'm still learning  to love myself 
 Yeah, yeah
Who I am, what I'm on
Who I've hurt and where they've gone
I know that I've done some wrong
But I'm tryna make it right
To the one I love, bring me 'round
Get me out right now 
And the ones I love
I'm still learning to love myself
 Yeah, yeah
I'm still learning  to love myself 
And I try and I try to remember sometimes
If I breathe, it's alright, but some things don't change
I'm still learning  to love myself 
To love myself, tryna love myself
I'm still learning to love myselfI found god
I found him in a lover
When his hair falls in his face
And his hands so cold they shake
I found the devil
I found him in a lover
And his lips like tangerines
In his color-coded speak
Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets
I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
I found a martyr
He told me that I'd never
With his educated eyes
And his head between my thighs
I found a savior
I don't think he remembers
Cause he's off to pay his crimes
And he's got no time for mine
Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets
I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
Every single night pray the sun will rise
Every single time make a compromise
Every single night pray the sun will rise, but
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down
I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
Every single night pray the sun will rise
Every single time make a compromise
Every single night pray the sun will rise, but
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down
X, X, XThey told me once, nothing grows
When a house ain't a home
Is it true, honestly
When it's all a part of me?
A couple years of waiting rooms
Finding God, and lose Him too
Wanna scream, but what's the use?
Lyin' awake, and I stare at the door
I just can't take it no more
They told me it's useless, there's no hope in store
But somehow I just want you more
I want you more
Somehow, I just want you more
I want you more
Somehow, I just want you more
Wooden floors and little feet
A flower bud in concrete
Feelin' so incomplete
Wonder will we ever meet?
And would you know it right away
How hard I tried to see your face?
A little screen, a photograph, mine to take
I sit and I stare at your clothes in the drawer
I cry and my knuckles get sore
'Cause I still believe it won't be like before
And now, somehow, I just want you more
I want you more
Somehow, I just want you more
I want you more
Somehow, I just want you more
And when you decide it's your time to arrive
I've loved you for all of my life
And nothing could stop me from giving a try
I've loved you for all of my life
Loved you more
Somehow, I still love you more
Love you more
Somehow, I still love you moreI'm my own biggest enemy
Yeah, all my empathy's a disaster
Feelin' somethin' like a scaly thing
Wrapped too tightly 'round my own master
My friends are gettin' bored of me
Sayin' I fell in love with a stranger
I don't know what they all think of me
But in reality, I don't even
Remember anything but thinkin' you're the one
And I can force a future like it's nothing
So I'll just hate everybody
Well, then why can't I go home without somebody?
And really, I could fall in love with anybody who don't want me
So I just keep sayin' I hate everybody
But maybe I, maybe I don't
I know I've got a tendency
To exaggerate what I'm seein'
And I know that it's unfair of me
To make a memory out of a feelin'
It's 'cause I notice every single thing
That's ever happening in the moment
And I don't know why it's consumin' me
Because honestly, all I know is
Infatuation's observation with a cause
But none of it is love, so while I'm waitin' for it
I'll hate everybody
Well, then why can't I go home without somebody?
And really, I could fall in love with anybody who don't want me
So I just keep sayin' I hate everybody
But maybe I, maybe I don't
If I could make you love me
Maybe you could make me love me
And if I can't make you love me
Then I'll just hate everybody
Everybody
Well, then why can't I go home without somebody?
And really, I could fall in love with anybody who don't want me
So I just keep sayin' I hate everybody
But maybe I, maybe I don'tI spent a long time watering a plant made out of plastic
And I cursed the ground for growing green
I spent a long time substituting honest with sarcastic
And I cursed my tongue for being mean
And weightless, breathless restitute
Motionless and absolute
You cut me open, sucked the poison from an aging wound
Now fifty thousand war cadets
Would cower at this small brunette
To my surprise, not six feet high
Who'd reach and grab the moon if I
Should ask or just imply
That I wanted a bit more light
So I could look inside his eyes
And get the colors just right
Just right, just right, just
Build love, build God, build provinces
Build calluses, break promises
'Cause I could never hold a perfect thing and not demolish it
What am I thinking? What does this mean?
How could somebody ever love me?
Talk to your man, tell him he's got bad news comin'You said I would've hit the ceiling
You said I
You said I should eat my feelings
Head held high
I won't take anyone down if I crawl tonight
But I still let everyone down when I change in size
And I went tumbling down tryna reach your high
But I scream too loud if I speak my mind
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
The devil in me
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
The devil in me
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Come back to life
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Come back to life
You said I'm too much to handle
You said I
Shine too bright, I burnt the candle
Flew too high
I won't take anyone down if I crawl tonight
But I still let everyone down when I change in size
And I went tumbling down tryna reach your high
But I scream too loud when I speak my mind
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
The devil in me
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
The devil in me
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Come back to life
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Come back to life
Now I gotta wake it up
Now I gotta wake it up
Now I gotta wake it up
The devil in me
Now I gotta wake it up
Now I gotta wake it up
Now I gotta wake it up
The devil in me
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Come back to life
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Come back to lifeYou were dancing in your tube socks in our hotel room
Flashing those eyes like highway signs
Light one up and hand it over, rest your head upon my shoulder
I just wanna feel your lips against my skin
White sheets, bright lights, crooked teeth, and the nightlife
You told me this is right where it begins
But your lips hang heavy underneath me
And I promised myself I wouldn’t let you complete me
I'm trying not to let it show, that I don't want to let this go
Is there somewhere you can meet me?
'Cause I clutched your arms like stairway railings
And you clutched my brain and eased my ailing
You're writing lines about me, romantic poetry
Your girl's got red in her cheeks
'Cause we're something she can't see
And I try to refrain but you're stuck in my brain
All I do is cry and complain, because second's not the same
I'm sorry but I fell in love tonight
I didn't mean to fall in love tonight
You're looking like you fell in love tonight
Could we pretend that we're in love?
I'm sorry but I fell in love tonight
I didn't mean to fall in love tonight
You're looking like you fell in love tonight
Could we pretend that we're in love?I woke up to another mess in the living room
Broken bottles all around my feet
They came again in the night under crescent moon
Didn't wake me in my sleep
'Cause they talk and drink and laugh 'bout things
And fall in love in my backyard
I hide and cower in the corner
Conversation's getting hard
'Cause nobody seems to ask about me anymore
And nobody seems to care 'bout anything I think
And nobody seems to recognize me in the crowd
In the background screaming, "Everybody, look at me"
And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
I'm standing in the ashes of who I used to be
And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire, fire
I used to be a darling starlet like a centerpiece
Had the whole world wrapped around my ring
I flew too closely to the sun that's setting in the East
And now I'm melting from my wings
'Cause I'd laugh and drink and talk 'bout things
And fall in love in my backyard
Now it´s my own anxiety
That makes the conversation hard
'Cause nobody seems to ask about me anymore
And nobody ever cares 'bout anything I think
And nobody seems to recognize me in the crowd
In the background screaming, "Everybody, look at me"
And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
And I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
I'm standing in the ashes of who I used to be
But I'm fading away, you know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire
Well, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire
You know, I used to be on fire, fireKeep on haunting
Keep on haunting me
Keep on haunting
Keep on haunting me
I was as pure as a river
But now I think I'm possessed
You put a fever inside me
And I've been cold since you left
I've got a boyfriend now and he's made of gold
And you've got your own mistakes in a bed at home
I'm hoping you could save me now, but you break and fold
You've got a fire inside, but your heart's so cold
Cause I've done some things that I can't speak
And I've tried to wash you away, but you just won't leave
So won't you take a breath and dive in deep?
Cause I came here so you'd come for me
I'm begging you to keep on haunting
I'm begging you to keep on haunting me
I'm begging you to keep on haunting
I know you're gonna keep on haunting me
We walk as tall as the skyline
And we have roots like the trees
But then your eyes had to wander
Cause they weren't looking at me
You weren't looking for me
Cause I've done some things that I can't speak
And I've tried to wash you away, but you just won't leave
So won't you take a breath and dive in deep?
Cause I came here so you'd come for me
I'm begging you to keep on haunting
I'm begging you to keep on haunting me
I'm begging you to keep on haunting
I know you're gonna keep on haunting me
Cause I've done some things that I can't speak
And I've tried to wash you away, but you just won't leave
So won't you take a breath and dive in deep?
Cause I came here so you'd come for me
I'm begging you to keep on haunting
I'm begging you to keep on haunting me
I'm begging you to keep on haunting
I know you're gonna keep on haunting meIf I
Said he tried to phone me, but I never have time
He said that I never listen, but I don't even try
I got a new place in Cali, but I'm gone every night
So I fill it with strangers so they keep on the lights
She said she told you she knows me, but the face isn't right
She asked if I recognized her and I told her I might
See, everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I'm still alone in my mind, yeah
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
Unh, look
I'm a real rare individual
I'm in the physical and the metaphysical 
I know you need your alone time, that's critical
But I need some of your time, is that hypocritical?
Damn, you know I relate to you more than fam
So I won't sit around and let you sink in quicksand
Look, I know you got million dollar plans
And you tryna build a brand, live a life in high demand
Swerving big b's, your bag got little G's
Gucci down to the socks like Biggie and Little Ceas'
Let's hit the Maldives and hide behind palm trees
Little red wine, weed, and a calm breeze
'Cause baby, you been living life inside a bubble
When the last time you had somebody hug you?
Hold up, when the last time you had somebody love you?
Hold up, when the last time you love someone who love you?
You know that everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it 
But I'm still alone in my mind
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did

But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
Yeah, yeah
You'll wish that you never did, oh
You'll wish that you never didI keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the lineTwo households, both alike in dignity
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents' strife
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love
And the continuance of their parents' rage
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
The which if you with patient ears attend
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend
I am a child of a
Money hungry, prideful country
Grass is green and it's always sunny
Hands so bloody, tastes like honey
I'm finding it hard to leave
I am a child of a
Money hungry, prideful country
Grass is green and it's always sunny
Hands so bloody, tastes like honey
I'm finding it hard to leaveYour eyes are fragile and timeless, it's beautiful
There's power in the words you whisper
He treats you cold and so mindless
That he don't see the setting sun
Your eyes are open when you kiss him
Your eyes are drawn to the wine list 
The usual, the towers in your world are sinkin'
And if you're lookin' for signs then, you should know 
There's power in the words you're thinkin'
Talk to your man
Tell him he got bad news comin' 
Walk on the edge with someone new
Talk to your man 
Time to have some good time lovin' 
You can take a chance, come take my handThey told me once, "There's a place where love conquers all"
A city with the streets full of milk and honey
I haven't found it yet, but I'm still searching
All I know is a hopeless place that flows with the blood of my kin
Perhaps hopeless isn't a place, nothing but a state of mind
They told me once, "Don't trust the moon, she's always changing"
The shores bend and break for her
And she begs to be loved, but nothing here is as it seems
Sun is coming up oh, why, oh, why, oh, why...
Sun is coming up oh, why, oh, why, oh, why...
Sun is coming up oh, why, oh, why, oh, why...
Sun is coming up oh, why, oh, why, oh, why...
Sun is coming up oh, why, oh, why, oh, why...
Sun is coming up oh, why, oh, why, oh, why...
Sun is coming up oh, why, oh, why, oh, why...I am not afraid anymore
Standing in the eye of the storm
Ready to face this, dying to taste this, sick sweet warmth
I am not afraid anymore
I want what you got in store
I'm ready to feed now, get in your seat now
And touch me like you never
And push me like you never
And touch me like you never
'Cause I am not afraid, I am not afraid anymore
No no no
No no no
No no no
No no no
No no no
I am not ashamed anymore
I want something so impure
You better impress now, watching my dress now fall to the floor
Crawling underneath my skin, sweet talk with a hint of sin
Begging you to take me
Devil underneath your grin, sweet thing, but she play to win, heaven gonna hate me
And touch me like you never
And push me like you never
And touch me like you never
'Cause I am not afraid, I am not afraid anymore
No no no
Crawling underneath my skin, sweet talk with a hint of sin
Begging you to take me
Devil underneath your grin, sweet thing, but she play to win, heaven gonna hate me
And touch me like you never
And push me like you never
And touch me like you never
'Cause I am not afraid, I am not afraid anymore
No no noWould you bleed for me?
Lick it off my lips like you needed me?
Would you sit me on a couch with your fingers in my mouth?
You look so cool when you're reading me
Let's cause a little trouble
Oh, you make me feel so weak
I bet you kiss your knuckles
Right before they touch my cheek
But I've got my mind made up this time
'Cause there's a menace in my bed
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
And I've got my mind made up this time
Go on and light a cigarette
Set a fire in my head
Set a fire in my head tonight
Would you lie for me?
Cross your sorry heart and hope to die for me?
Would you pin me to a wall?
Would you beg or would you crawl?
Stick a needle in your hungry eyes for me?
Let's cause a little trouble
Oh, you make me feel so weak
I bet you kiss your knuckles
Right before they touch my cheek
But I've got my mind made up this time
'Cause there's a menace in my bed
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
And I've got my mind made up this time
Go on and light a cigarette
Set a fire in my head
Set a fire in my head tonight
Don't forget me, don't forget me
I wouldn't leave you if you'd let me
When you met me, when you met me
You told me you were gonna get me
Don't forget me, don't forget me
I wouldn't leave you if you'd
And I've got my mind made up this time
'Cause there's a menace in my bed
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
And I've got my mind made up this time
Go on and light a cigarette
Set a fire in my head
Set a fire in my head tonight, tonight, tonight
Set a fire in my head tonightHmm
Everything is—
Everything is 
Everything is 
You're dripping like a saturated sunrise 
Everything is blue 
I hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old
Everything is blue 
Everything is 
HmmSo we laid down on the floor next to our brand new bed
Just so we could listen closer to this new Kanye West
But I can barely hear over the music in my head
All these 808s and heartbeats bangin' in your chest
Told the driver "keep it goin'," he can run the meter
So we could finally hear Views on some decent speakers
Yellin' everytime the beat drop like a cheerleader
Spillin' a flask of Avion on your brand new sneakers
Now we at the Vogue party and the whole thing's catered
So we said that we'd leave early, get some pizza later
But my hands go down your jeans and you distract the waiter
Until we take it somewhere better like the elevator
'Til we back out on the 405 with Baby Bash
You're making me laugh, now I'm just trying not to crash
But if all we do is drive, sugar how'd you get so fly?
And I see people staring at us from the overpass
But these days I've dropped the keys to Anthony's Mercedes
We're standin' naked in the kitchen listenin' to Amy
And in those weeks you fuckin' lost it cause you just wrote "Crazy"
It seems like you never listen and I hate you lately…Why you drive so fast?
Why you drive so fast?
Girl, where you gotta go?
Girl, where you gotta go?
Baby you should try and drive slow
You should try and drive slow
Cause you're goin' 45 on a 15
I'm just tryna stay alive on the big screen
When you comin' up the drive all the kids scream
I don't know, baby girl you movin' onto better things
Why you drive so?
I don't have the time
I'm just tryna get mine
He's at it again, he's at it again, it happened, my friend
I had to pretend cause I'm only in this city for a minute
And I know you've been tryin' to get in it, and I'm with it but
You looking like you fell in love tonight
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
We hooked up one time it was kind of whatever... but...
Would you believe me if I said I was drunk?
Maybe I want you to want me but only tonight
Why you drive so fast?
Why you drive so fast?
Girl, where you gotta go?
Girl, where you gotta go?
Baby you should try and drive slow
Cause you're goin' 45 on a 15
I'm just tryna stay alive on the big screen
When you comin' up the drive all the kids scream
I don't know, baby girl you movin' onto better things
Why you drive so?
Usually you don't be used to me usin' you
You saw the truth in me, this is all new to you, damn
Well this is love in the fast lane
New Benz, top down with the back stained
I was tryna give you Js and some fast brain
You were tryna give me Ks and your last name
Boy I think I should leave
Cause there's a flaw in the system
I don't really know why but I miss him
It was somethin' in his eyes when I kissed him
Listen, feeling like I can't dismiss him
For Pete's sake, homie pull it together
Cause you've got a girl and she thinks it's forever
I know she'd love you if you'd only let her
Cause I'm a mistake and we both could do better
Why you drive so fast?
Why you drive so fast?
Girl, where you gotta go?
Girl, where you gotta go?
Baby you should try and drive slow
You should try and drive slow
Cause you're goin' 45 on a 15
I'm just tryna stay alive on the big screen
When you comin' up the drive all the kids scream
I don't know, baby girl you movin' onto better things
Why you drive so fast?
Why you drive so fast?
Girl, where you gotta go?
Girl, where you gotta go?
Baby you should try and drive slow...You're the only one that makes me wait all the time

Do I have to replace you every summer?
You're the only woman on my mind 
You're the only way I spend my time
Tick, tick, tick, boom

No, really, I ain't even mad anymore
Yeah, I don't even want you back anymore
I don't remember what we had anymore, yeah
I hope your back aches and your knees hurt
I hope you think about me sleepin' in your T-shirt
I hope your little brother turns out to be nothing like you
I hope that you hurt more than I do
And honestly, I still wish you nothing but the best
I know that you're still self-obsessed
I hear the wicked get no rest
But when you do, I hope you dream of me

Regretting that you ever lied these days
I hope it's eating you alive these days 
I hope you're up late in a bathroom
Just wishin' I'ma change my mind and come back soon
I hope that when you're thirty-five years
You'll wish that you tried to
'Cause I know that I do
And honestly, I still wish you nothing but the best
I know that you're still self-obsessed
I hear the wicked get no rest
But when you do, I hope you dream of me
Yeah, I hope you dream of me
Yeah, I hope you dream of me
I hope you dream of me
I ain't even mad about it anymore

Maybe just a little less than I was before
I've got a twenty dollar bill that says
You're never, ever, ever gonna change
I still wish you nothing but the best
I know that you're still self-obsessed
I hear the wicked get no rest
But when you do, I hope you dream of me

Bitch, you don’t know how good I treat ya
Shake it off, this pride and glory
You dig up so many stories

Four fingers from a knuckle sandwich
Try my blood, it's just a starter
No one tastes like me, yeah
I’m pretty like a car crash, ugly as a lullaby
You really wanna try it?
Experiment on me, experiment on me
Experiment on me, experiment on me
Girl, I've been way too much to handle
Bitch, I've never been a good example
"Seen, not heard" is what they told me
I look too good to be this lonely
Oh, grab this loaded gun
So hopeless, but I'm still romantic
Bloodstained mouth, gonna blow a kiss
And I bet it tastes like me, yeah
I'm pretty like a car crash, ugly as a lullaby
You really wanna try it?
Experiment on me, experiment on me
Experiment on me, experiment on me

Lock up your sons, make way for the daughters
You be the lamb and we’ll be the slaughter
You burnt the witches, now you're defenseless
Who needs a Y with this many Xs?
Who needs a Y with this many Xs?
Who needs a Y with this many Xs?
Who needs a Y with this many Xs?
Who needs a Y with this many Xs?
I’m pretty like a car crash, ugly as a lullaby
You really wanna try it?
Experiment on me, experiment on me
Experiment on me, experiment on me
Experiment on me
Experiment on me
Experiment on meI, I must confess
How hard I tried to breathe, through the trees of loneliness
You, you must confess
How hard you need to see, through the heart beating out my chest
Feel like we've been falling down
Like these autumn leaves
But baby, don't let winter come
Don't let our hearts freeze
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
Dark as midnight sun
Smoke as black as charcoal fills into our fragile lungs
'Cause when our demons come
Dancing in the shadows to a game that can't be won
Feel like we've been falling down
Like these autumn leaves
But baby, don't let winter come
Don't let our hearts freeze
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
We're the underdogs, in this world alone
I'm a believer, got a fever running through my bones
We're the alley cats, and they can throw their stones
They can break our hearts, they won't take our souls
We're the underdogs, in this world alone
I'm a believer, got a fever running through my bones
We're the alley cats, and they can throw their stones
They can break our hearts, they won't take our soul
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
We will walk away from empty goldHey, you know I tell her all the time
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna make you cry
I'll be damned if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before they dry
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna make you cry
I'll be damned if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before they dry
Keep your friends close, but this pretty girl closer
Kiss her on the neck, little baby is a poser
Thinks she's so cold, but the world is colder
Take her in my lap and I'll promise that I'll hold her
My bed is too big for only me
I keep a pistol when I sleep
Inside my mouth so I can shoot
Down all the bad things
You know I tell her all the time
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna make you cry
I'll be damned if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before they dry
You know I tell her all the time
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna make you cry
I'll be damned if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before they dry
Mmm-mmm
Yeah, yeahYour little brother never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old
You're dripping like a saturated sunrise
And you're spilling like an overflowing sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearing through the pages and the ink
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue
You were a vision in the morning when the light came through
I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you
You said you'll never be forgiven till your boys are too
And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you
You're dripping like a saturated sunrise
And you're spilling like an overflowing sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearing through the pages and the ink
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And it's blue
And he's blue
Art is not what I create
What I create is chaos
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
But he's blue
And he's blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blueAh, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

He said, "Darling, who you praying to?
Was anybody answering you?
Because I've done my part for twelve years now
And I can't seem to get through"
He said, "I really don't care if you cut your hair
And I really wouldn't mind if we don't go anywhere
Cause I've got you, yeah, I've got you now
I've got you"
And you think my bruised knees are sort of pretty
And I think your tired eyes are kind of nice
And when I first met you, there was a garden
Growing from a black hole in my mind
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
He said, "Darling, what's it coming to?
And have you got a lighter on you?
Been trying put these down for ages now
But I can't seem to come through"
He said, "I really don't mind if we take our time
Cause I've got a couple bottles of your favorite wine
Cause I've got you, yeah, I've got you now
I've got you"
And you think my bruised knees are sort of pretty
And I think your tired eyes are kind of nice
And when I first met you, there was a garden
Growing from a black hole in my mind
Said I love everything that you've got, boy
Tell me, would you be mine?
Be mine, be mine
Sick, sweet nothing's you're tryna talk, boy
Tell me would you be mine?
Be mine, be mine
And you think my bruised knees are sort of pretty
And I think your tired eyes are kind of nice
And when I first met you, there was a garden
Growing from a black hole in my mindOnce upon a time, when albums were debuted
Haylor was conceived, we panicked cause we knew
She'd hurt him, she'd hurt him
She'd hurt him, him, him, him, him
At first we didn't care, we figured she'd back off
She'd always got around, we thought she'd take a walk
And desert him, desert him
Desert him, him, him, him, him
But she's still here, in the city
And we realized that we can agree
That we knew she was trouble when she snagged Styles
How could we allow Taylor to get him with her fake smiles
It seems he's her's now
We knew she was trouble when she got Styles
So shame on us now
This fandom's getting kind of hostile
She's gonna put him in her "ex boy pile"
Oh, oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Now Harry's got it bad, they're walking in Times square
The fans can see it all, he doesn't even care
He's blinded, he's blinded
He's blinded-ed-ed-ed-ed
We heard that 'they're so in love' from whispers down the street
But all she really wants is a track for her CD
I hope he sees, I hope he sees
I hope he see-e-e-e-es
She's so anal, a control freak
When he realizes he'll dump her next week
Yeah
That we knew she was trouble when she snagged Styles
How could we allow Taylor to get him with her fake smiles
It seems he's her's now
We knew she was trouble when she got Styles
So shame on us now
This fandom's getting kind of hostile
She's gonna put him in her "ex boy pile"
Oh, oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
And the saddest fear starts creeping in
That we'd be pissed off
If he loved anyone or anything, yeah
And now we're getting angry cause she snagged Styles
My dashboard hates her
Let's just say this shit better be worthwhile
Cause if he dates her
She's gonna put Harry through some tough trials
And write an album with his name on fileHello, and I'm sorry.
A salutation and a farewell.
I don't have much time.
This Times New Roman is gonna fly through my fingertips,
like a plague of moths.
The hollow black letter shells crunched into the ground
like the skin of a cicada.
This is all that's left.
And you can do whatever you want with it.
Keep it to yourself,
or let it serve as a warning.
This city is disgusting;
a corpse of what it used to be.
The people are filthy, gluttonous,
Ruled by the power exchange of sex
from the hands of the proletariat to the bourgeoisie.
The tops of the skylines buzz with the lackluster enthusiasm.
The ground level is caked in dirt and rust and grime,
and the people that dwell there awake and rub the filmy layer off their lukewarm eyes.
There are some here I love,
some who fear me,
and some who wish I was dead.
I didn't ask for this;
no one asks for this.
You're born into it.
You grow up oblivious and sheltered
and one day the evil realities of this place hit you square between the eyes like a perfectly aimed bullet.
If this were a movie,
I would ride off in some blood red sunset down a stretch of desert road
into the wasteland that keeps us captive here.
But this isn't a movie,
these are the Badlands.A fix that I could never find
Is it in my chemicals
Is it in my chemicals
Is it unforgettable
Or medical
I'll never know
Is it in my chemicals
Is it in my chemicals
Is it unforgettable
Or medical
I'll never knowI'm gonna start this out by saying
I need to get it off my chest
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret
I know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
I'm gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way
No, you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs or cars
And I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so fucking far
That you will never ever touch me again
I won't see your alligator tears
'Cause know I've had enough of them
Gonna start this out by saying
I really meant well from the start
Thought I'd take a broken man right in my hands
And then put back all his parts
But you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls or cars
And I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
Thought I'd take a broken man, put him in my hands and...
Fuck that, oh my god, I hate myself
So close!
Oh, whatever, you get the point"Is There Somewhere"Hey guys. What's up? It's Halsey..um, I'm here to tell you a little bit more about my EP. The first song is "Is There Somewhere" and I actually wrote and recorded this song on Garage Band at first like a couple of months before I signed, um ... and I put it up on Youtube and um, it was like the most amateur thing ever. It was like I had put up this video and the end of it had like a little black slide that said, like, insert title here because I had no idea how to use technology. Basically, "Is There Somewhere" is like a prologue to the EP cause the EP is called "Room 93" and um, it basically just touches on like the human intimacy of hotel rooms and how it's like an alternate universe and "Is There Somewhere" is like a prologue to that. It kinda tells the story of a couple in a hotel room, experiencing, like, a tender moment together and the most notable line is "Is there somewhere you can meet me?" because it's like a frequently exchanged text message between myself and the person this song's about. It was kinda like, "Is there somewhere you can meet me?" and it usually ended up being an hotel room. So that's where "Is There Somewhere" came from and I think it's one of my favorite songs... I've ever written."Ghost""Ghost" was one of the first songs I ever wrote in like, an actual studio environment. I wrote it with my friend Dylan Scott, whose in a band called "Young Rising Sons." I just started The Halsey project, I had no idea what I was doing and I was writing like, acoustic songs before this.  We sat down and we started like, messing with sounds and we wanted like these, "church-y, scary, shimmery sounds" -- the words I used. Most people when you're like, "Hey, I want shimmery sounds," are like, "What?" but he knew right away. So we came up with "Ghost" and it ended up just being like my signature. It was like how I knew what the Halsey project was gonna sound like. It was our single and, you know, SiriusXM started playing it which was awesome. A lot of people give me a lot of weird looks for it because it's like two minutes and thirty seconds long, it starts with the bridge, doesn't make any sense, there's like a rap, white girl part in the beginning in it, but we moved forward with it because we had faith in it, and I'm really glad we did ... and it's the fan favorite."Hurricane""Hurricane," mmm...is like the trippy song, I love this song. When I play this live, I, like, close my eyes and zone out super hard and kinda like forget that I'm on stage cause it's so dreamy. It's about a girl that kinda like falls for this guy who supposedly gonna make things hard on her and is gonna take advantage of her, but she kinda ends up turning it around in the end and she says: "I'm a wanderess/I'm a one night stand/Don't belong to no city/Don't belong to no man." So it's kinda like her response to him, saying like you know, "You can think you got me all you want, but I don't belong to anyone but me." And you know, I talk about Brooklyn, Brooklyn's my place. That's where Halsey comes from. It's definitely a very special song to me and I love it. Yeah."Empty Gold"Man, we must've sent "Empty Gold" to get additional production on it like eight times because it just has this HUGE cinematic feeling to it. Just like, this big action scene, like ... things are gonna come to a resolve, walking to the end of the sunset, credits-rolling kind of feeling, and we really wanted someone who was gonna nail that 'cause you know I tell you guys all the time that I want my music to have a cinematic quality and a very visual aspect.  "Empty Gold" is like one of those songs that really just built up for me and had like a lot of swa-gger. Swagger? Oh yeah, swagger, I'll use that one. It was also kind of like, hikening and there's like a build up and it's like really exciting. So when we finally got this version back, we were all ecstatic about it because it gives you like this reckless, breathless feeling, but there's also a sense of triumph in it, and I think that was really important to us in putting this song out."Trouble - Stripped"
So we had a couple of versions of "Trouble" that were really big- and vindicated-sounding, but we kind of decided to just put this demo version on the EP instead because we felt like it had a lot more feeling. I think "Trouble" is one of the most emotional pre-chorus, choruses, I ever written in my life; "Let's cause a little trouble/Oh, you make me feel so weak/I bet you kiss your knuckles/Right before they touch my cheek." And that's a metaphor in itself, and it means that someone who takes pleasure and takes some, like, sadistic joy in making you feel bad and hurting you in a mental way. And I kinda took that and put it in physical words so you could really understand how sadistic and twisted it is to be in a relationship where someone enjoys hurting you and that's that line: "I bet you kiss your knuckles before you touch my cheek." It's this kinda like pompous, there's like a smirk; there's a smugness in this sense of like, this person is proud of what they're doing to you. But then the chorus is very vindicated and it says you know, "I've got my mind made up this time." You know it's about having control and wanting to leave and that's the thing that I sing about a lot. There's a lot of honesty in what I sing, but I also make sure that I never play the victim, and that my protagonist always has the option and the intention to leave and take care of themselves, and that's kinda what "Trouble" is to me.Hello, and I'm sorry

I would ride off in some blood red sunset down a stretch of desert road into the wasteland that keeps us captive here
But this isn't a movie
These are the BADLANDS...Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close 
I was afraid to leave you on your own 
I said I'd catch you if you fall 
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all 
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
Thinkin' you could—
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries 
Just runnin' from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind
Said I'd catch you if you fall
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?

You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why 
You don't have to say just what you did
I already know 
I had to go and find out from them 
So tell me, how's it feel? 
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeahGrowing older's like a sickness that you try but can't prevent
And I've been swallowing prescriptions like mental vitamins
And I've been travelling down the backroads on the corners of these streets
And everytime I saw those headlights I knew you were here for me
Let me hear you say yoo-uth
That yoo-outh
If you need me you can find me on the roof
Where I pretend that all my problems are beneath me
And I'm worried that I'll jump but I never do
To be honest I just think I like the viewI still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It’s to the point where I love and I hate you
But I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can’t take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
But I cannot change you, so I must replace you
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want this to end
I should’ve listened to my friends, no
I put this shit in the past, and I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil boys had the prettiest face?
I gave you a heart that was full of mistakes
You gave me your heart then you made heart break
You made my heart break
You made my heart break
You made my heart break again
You made my heart break
You made my heart break
You made my heart break again
And I still see your shadows in my room
Can’t take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
But I cannot change you, so I must replace you
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin’ to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget meYeah, I know when you're around
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart
Yeah, I know when you're around
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart
Can't believe you forgot my name
Oh babe, I made you cum again
He said, "I've got a problem with your shoes
And your tunes, but I might move in
And I thought that you were straight, now I'm wonderin'"
Oh and you say I'm such a cliche
I can't see the difference in it anyway
And we left things to protect my mental health
But I'll call you when you're bored or you're playing with yourself
You're so conceited, I said "I don't love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it, but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
Cause I know you do
Know when you're around
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart
Yeah, I know when you're around
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart
It's not about reciprocation, it's just all about me
I'm sympathetic, poetic, dramatic, but I wanna be
And there's so much skin to see
A simple Epicurean philosophy
You're so conceited, you said you don't love me
What does it matter if you lie to me?
And I don't regret it, but I still can't sleep
So don't you tell me that you're sorry
Cause I know you did it purposely
Know when you're around
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart
Yeah, I know when you're around
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart
And I feel your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
I feel your heartbeat
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart
I feel your heartbeat
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart
Yeah, I know when you're around
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound
Yeah, I know when you're around
Cause I know the sound, I know the soundStill I pu-pull up in the Benz wid tha all gold ting

And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want everyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
But I been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and fuck yourself
And when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And when you tried to tell me my opinion was wrong
Then tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want everyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and fuck yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down these walls?
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and fuck yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Well baby you should go and fuck yourselfLove of mine, someday you will die
But I'll be close behind, I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark
If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
You into the dark
In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me, "Son
Fear is the heart of love," so I never went back
If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "No"s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
You into the dark
You and me have seen everything to see from Bangkok to Calgary
And the soles of your shoes are all worn down
The time for sleep is now, it's nothing to cry about
'Cause we'll hold each other soon in the blackest of rooms
And if Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
And illuminate the "No"s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
Then I'll follow you into the dark
You into the darkI went down to a place in Bed-Stuy
A little liquor on my lips
I let him climb inside my body
And held him captive in my kiss
And there’s a storm you’re starting now
And there’s a storm you’re starting now
And there’s a storm you’re starting
Starting, starting, starting…
I’m a wanderess
I’m a one night stand
Don’t belong to no city
Don’t belong to no man
I’m the violence in the pouring rain
I’m a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I’m a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I’m a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh
I’m a wanderess
I’m a one night stand
Don’t belong to no city
Don’t belong to no man
I’m the violence in the pouring rain
I’m a hurricane
I’m a hurricane
I went down to a place in Brooklyn
Where you tripped on LSD
And I found myself reminded
To keep you far away from me
And there’s a storm you’re starting now
And there’s a storm you’re starting now
And there’s a storm you’re starting
Starting, starting, starting…
I’m a wanderess
I’m a one night stand
Don’t belong to no city
Don’t belong to no man
I’m the violence in the pouring rain
I’m a hurricane
Ha ah ah, ha ah ah, ahh

He says, “Oh, baby, beggin’ you to save me
Well lately, I like ’em crazy
Oh, maybe, you could devastate me
Little lady, come and fade me”
I’m a wanderess
I’m a one night stand
Don’t belong to no city
Don’t belong to no man
I’m the violence in the pouring rain
I’m a hurricaneIt's 2009 and I'm 14 and I'm crying
Not really sure where I am but I'm holding the hand of my best friend Sam
In the waiting room of a Planned Parenthood
The air is sterile and clean, and the walls are that not grey, but green
And the lights are so bright they could burn a whole through the seam of my jeans
And my phone is buzzing in the pocket
My mom is asking me if I remembered my keys 'cause she's closing the door and she needs to lock it
But I can't tell my mom where I've gone
I can't tell anyone at all
You see, my best friend Sam was raped by a man that we knew 'cause he worked in the after-school program
And he held her down with her textbooks beside her
And he covered her mouth and he came inside her
So now I'm with Sam, at the place with a plan, waiting for the results of a medical exam
And she's praying she doesn't need an abortion, she couldn't afford it
And her parents would, like, totally kill her
It's 2002 and my family just moved and the only people I know are my mom's friend, Sue, and her son
He's got a case of Matchbox cars and he says that he'll teach me to play the guitar if I just keep quiet
And the stairwell beside Apartment 1245 will haunt me in my sleep for as long as I am alive
And I'm too young to know why it aches in my thighs, but I must lie, I must lie
It's 2012 and I'm dating a guy and I sleep in his bed and I just learned how to drive
And he's older than me and he drinks whiskey neat and he's paying for everything
This adult thing is not cheap
We've been fighting a lot, almost 10 times a week
And he wants to have sex, and I just want to sleep
But he says I can't say no to him
This much I owe to him
He buys my dinner, so I have to blow him
He's taken to forcing me down on my knees
And I'm confused 'cause he's hurting me while he says please
And he's only a man, and these things he just needs
He's my boyfriend, so why am I filled with unease?
It's 2017 and I live like a queen
And I've followed damn near every one of my dreams
I'm invincible and I'm so fucking naive
I believe I'm protected 'cause I live on a screen
Nobody would dare act that way around me
I've earned my protection, eternally clean
Until a man that I trust gets his hands in my pants
But I don't want none of that, I just wanted to dance
And I wake up the next morning like I'm in a trance and there's blood
Is that my blood?
H-hold on a minute
You see I've worked every day since I was 18
I've toured everywhere from Japan to Mar-a-Lago
I even went on stage that night in Chicago when I was having a miscarriage
I mean, I pied the piper, I put on a diaper
And sang out my spleen to a room full of teens
What do you mean this happened to me?
You can't put your hands on me
You don't know what my body has been through
I'm supposed to be safe now
I earned it
It's 2018 and I've realized nobody is safe long as she is alive
And every friend that I know has a story like mine
And the world tells me we should take it as a compliment
But then heroes like Ashley and Simone and Gabby, McKayla and Gaga, Rosario, Aly
Remind me this is the beginning, it is not the finale
And that's why we're here
And that's why we rally
It's Olympians and a medical resident and not one fucking word from the man who is President
It's about closed doors and secrets and legs and stilletos from the Hollywood hills to the projects in ghettos
When babies are ripped from the arms of teen mothers and child brides cry globally under the covers
Who don't have a voice on the magazine covers
They tell us take cover
But we are not free until all of us are free
So love your neighbor, please treat her kindly
Ask her her story and then shut up and listen
Black, Asian, poor, wealthy, trans, cis, Muslim, Christian
Listen, listen and then yell at the top of your lungs
Be a voice for all those who have prisoner tongues
For the people who had to grow up way too young
There is work to be done
There are songs to be sung
Lord knows there's a war to be wonClutching the steering wheel and crying aloud
But your voice on the airwaves drowns me out
Crazy to think that since five AM all I see is green eyes and I'm lost in them and
I get it she's tall and she's pretty and blonde and she can write one hell of a break up song but
She'll never love you like I could
Now I wonder what it's like to run my fingers through your hair
But I'll never know
And I wonder what it's like to come home late and have you there
But I'll never know
And I've memorized every line on your fingertips
And I've fantasized 'bout what it's like to say goodnight to your kiss
And it's crazy to think that I've given up hope
And I've sunken the ships, somebody throw me the rope
It's getting too late to be seeing your face
And I'm dreaming of the ways that you probably taste
The dimples on your cheeks, yeah, they swallow me up
And I'm lost on your body because you're making it rough
Tracing the ink on your skin in my mind
Well, your girls got an album that is better than mine
Now I wonder what it's like to run my fingers through your hair
But I'll never know
And I wonder what it's like to come home late and have you there
But I'll never know
And I've memorized every line on your fingertips
And I've fantasized 'bout what it's like to say goodnight to your kiss
And you said you'd be back for me
Love the dimples in my back for me
And I believed it's true
And if you do all that for me
At the very least I'd have to be writing this one for you
Now I wonder what it's like to run my fingers through your hair
But I'll never know
And I wonder what it's like to come home late and have you there
But I'll never know
And I've memorized every line on your fingertips
And I've fantasized 'bout what it's like to say goodnight to your kiss
She'll never love you like I could
She'll never love you like I couldYou see, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah
I'm the one
Early mornin' in the dawn, know you wanna ride now
I'm the one, yeah
I'm the one, yeah
I know you're sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate ya
Know you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh, I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh, the only one
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh, I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh
'Cause I'm the one that hit that same spot
Sold out arenas but I do it in a tank top, yeah
See, 100 got that new drop
We makin' records, breakin' records off a laptop
Feelin' good when I wake up
Listen to Khaled when I'm puttin' on my make up
Me and my mans would always fight and then we'd break up
So I moved on and put some zeroes on my pay stubs
I lost some things, then I found them
I got some day ones and I always stick around them
This summer droppin' and I know we gon' astound them
And plus I went and I put Quavo on the album
You're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah
I'm the one
Early mornin' in the dawn, know you wanna ride now
I'm the one, yeah
I'm the one, yeah
I know you're sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate ya
Know you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh, I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh, the only one
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh, I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh, eh-oh
Just got myself a baby blue Chanel
I used it twice, despite the price, and put it on the shelf
And when I roll up in the club, no one can ever tell
Stay in the back, so I can grab all on his Gucci belt 
But we don't got no label
Don't really want bottles
Nothing in my nasal
Wanna keep it lowkey
Sneak under the table
DJ play The Weekend, tell me are you Abel? 
Love, love, love, makin' love still
It's been a minute, but he always get it rough, still
He callin', ask if we can do it in the tub still
And so I pull up 
You know you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah
I'm the one
Early mornin' in the dawn, know you wanna ride now
I'm the one, yeah
I'm the one, yeah
I know you're sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate ya
Know you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah
Don't you know girl, don't you know girl
I am the one for you
Don't you know girl, don't you know girl
I am the one for you
Don't you know girl, don't you know girl
I am the one for you
Don't you know girl, don't you know girl
I am the one for youUh
Yeah, yeah
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough 
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus 
Oh no, your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know that we ride
Through the backstreets in my blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
Seventeen and we got a dream to have a family
A house and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly we turned twenty-three
Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Half our friends are now our enemies
Now I-, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know where we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me
Singing
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't setI had a vision and I watched it come alive
And now I'm wishin' that I had a bit more time
I have been achin' in my bones at night
Conversations with my bloodshot eyes
Hard to focus when the pressure makes you blind
All I wanted was to make some art, talk some shit
Didn't really care about getting rich
Now they make this hard
Tryna make me quit
Maybe for the thrill of it
Baby, hold me
I'm looking for a little bit of honesty
Take me, slowly
Give me just a little, baby, promise me
There's a hollow in my chest
And you can take whatever's left
Baby, maybe
You could give me just a little bit of honesty
I've been sleeping in a bed too big for me
Can't remember what it's like to get some sleep
I've fallin' victim to a homesick life
Got a cravin' that I just can't buy
God, I wonder if I'll ever make it right
All I wanted was to make some art, talk some shit
Didn't really care about getting rich
Now they make this hard
Tryna make me quit
Maybe for the thrill of it
Baby, hold me
I'm looking for a little bit of honesty
Take me, slowly
Give me just a little, baby, promise me
There's a hollow in my chest
And you can take whatever's left
Baby, maybe
You could give me just a little bit of honesty
Give me now, give me now
Give me now, honesty now
Give me now, give me now
Give me now, honesty now
Give me now, give me now
Give me now, honesty now
Give me now, give me now
Give me now, honesty
Baby, hold me
I'm looking for a little bit of honesty
Take me, slowly
Give me just a little, baby, promise me
There's a hollow in my chest
And you can take whatever's left
Baby, maybe
You could give me just a little bit of honesty
Give me a just a little bit of honestyWasting time, lost in love
We can go where no one will ever find us
So let's waste time
While we're young
We can drive til the morning sun comes up
We've got no place to go
But we can make it on our own
We're drivin' slowly, down a country road
We can keep on through the night
If I got you by my side
I see the stars reflected in your eyes
Think we got something special
Living life like we are rebels
You know we've got potential
Wasting time, lost in love
We can go where no one will ever find us
So let's waste time
While we're young
We can drive til the morning sun comes up
If the road gets tough
Being with you is enough
We're singing all the songs we used to love
We've got nothing to lose
And we're out with something new
But it all feels like home when I'm with you
Think we got something special
Living life like we are rebels
You know we got potential
Wasting time, lost in love
We can go where no one will ever find us
So let's waste time
While we're young
We can drive til the morning sun comes upIf I
Said he tried to phone me, but I never have time
He said that I never listen, but I don't even try
I got a new place in Cali, but I'm gone every night
So I fill it with strangers so they keep on the lights
She said she told you she knows me, but the face isn't right
She asked if I recognized her and I told her I might
See, everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I'm still alone in my mind, yeah
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
Unh, look
I'm a real rare individual
I'm in the physical and the metaphysical 
I know you need your alone time, that's critical
But I need some of your time, is that hypocritical?
Damn, you know I relate to you more than fam
So I won't sit around and let you sink in quicksand
Look, I know you got million dollar plans
And you tryna build a brand, live a life in high demand
Swerving big b's, your bag got little G's
Gucci down to the socks like Biggie and Little Ceas'
Let's hit the Maldives and hide behind palm trees
Little red wine, weed, and a calm breeze
'Cause baby, you been living life inside a bubble
When the last time you had somebody hug you?
Hold up, when the last time you had somebody love you?
Hold up, when the last time you love someone who love you?
You know that everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it 
But I'm still alone in my mind
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this

You'll wish that you never did
Yeah, yeah
You'll wish that you never did, oh
You'll wish that you never didGot a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades
Each time the feeling fades
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades
I'm bad at love 
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one 
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at loveYou're probably sitting at a bar
Fingers loosely cradling a glass
I'm miles from where you are
Can't remember when I saw you last
We both have so called responsibilities
And others to answer to tomorrow
But right now I'm begging you to be my safety
The kind of love I can't return, but I'm gonna borrow
Your eyes meet mine
The lights are playing shadows right down to your collar
Your love is calling
I'm praying you'll do anything to stall her
I'm sorry darling, I know he's yours
I know you make him breakfast and fit between his arms
Tonight I'm borrowing a perfect man
I'm borrowing your broken love
I'm sorry darling, I know he's yours
I know you wear his class ring and I don't mean you any harm
Tonight I'm borrowing a perfect man
I'm borrowing your broken love
You laugh and offer some honest conversation
Catch me in the cracks between your crooked smile
Your words are more like illustrations
Toss your head back, but I know you'll stay a while
Your eyes meet mine
The lights are playing shadows right down to your collar
Tonight I'm borrowing a broken man
I'm borrowing your perfect love
Your love is calling
I'm praying you'll do anything to stall her
Tonight I'm borrowing a broken man
I'm borrowing your perfect love
Tell me, how can a heavy heart be so empty?
You left all your baggage on my steps when you went and left me
I'm sorry darling, I know he's yours
I know you make him breakfast and fit between his arms
Tonight I'm borrowing a perfect man
I'm borrowing your broken man
I'm sorry darling, I know he's yours
I know you keep him close and I don't mean you any harm
Tonight I'm borrowing a perfect man
I'm borrowing your broken loveI don't wanna fight right now

Now or neverIt's crazy when
The thing you love the most is the detriment
Let that sink in
You can think again
When the hand you wanna hold is a weapon and
You're nothin' but skin
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running
They say I may be making a mistake
I would have followed all the way, no matter how far
I know when you go down all your darkest roads
I would have followed all the way to the graveyard
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I would have followed all the way to the graveyard
No, oh
You look at me 
With eyes so dark, don't know how you even see
You push right through me 
It's gettin' real
You lock the door, you're drunk at the steering wheel
And I can't conceal
Oh, 'cause I've been diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are

I'm bad at love 
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one 
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love 
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one 
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love 
I'm bad at love 
I'm bad at love 
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away

I'm bad at love 
Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love 
I'm bad at love 
Oh, ohOne, two, one, two, three
Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck around, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo, solo, solo
Solo, solo, solo
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in Hell there's Heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in Hell there's Heaven
(Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Solo, solo, solo
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish somebody would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in Hell there's Heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in Hell there's Heaven
(Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah)
Solo, solo, solo, soloGot a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I

You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece

I set it out a fire just to keep Um, I wrote this album when I was 19 years old. And uh, I was going through a really tough time when I wrote it, um. You guys showed me that there's so many people who are going through the same things that I was going through. And this album was really important to me because when I wrote this album, I was so confident in myself, I knew who the fuck I was. I was 19 years old and I said, "Don't belong to no fucking city, Don't belong to no fucking man, man."
But I was so wrong, because I uh, I was going to forget who I was, and I was going to find her again, and then forget who I was, and then find her again, and forget her and find her and forget her and find hеr and forget her and find her... And I'vе learned to stop being so hard on myself for changing and for growing and for learning. 
I don't usually like giving a ton of advice during my shows because I mean, what the fuck do I know that you don't know?  I'm a, I'm a disaster. Um, but if I do give you one piece of advice right now, I want to remind you that if you lose yourself, it is never too late to find yourself again. That when you stumble upon the person that you used to be, they will be so happy to see you.I'm no sweet dream but I’m a hell of a night
:
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I’ve trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors
"Come on, little lady, give us a smile"
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing
I, I keep a record of the wreckage of my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage of my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
:
No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I’ve been polite, but won’t be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do in my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
’Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be
"Come on, little lady, give us a smile"
No, I ain't got nothin’ to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing
I, I keep a record of the wreckage of my life

NewOh man.
Hi.
You guys are so loud.
I'm glad I have this moment to talk to you because this whole thing is going by so fast I can't even like, process what's happening, um, this is my first headline show in the States in like, 8 months? And I was really nervous today, which is so weird 'cause I don't really get nervous anymore but today I was so nervous.
Um, it's really exciting to play the album for you guys this way because this is how I intended for it to be heard. And I did these shows because I wanted you guys — I wanted you guys to know how much you mean to me but, um, I also did them for myself because,  because for the past couple months I've, uh, put out a lot of singles, and some of them have changed my life forever.
I'm in the studio working on new music. I wanted, I wanted to remind myself that you guys are a group of people who love albums. You love stories, you love people, and all of us are here for the same reason, we're here because we are strong in the face of defeat, we're here because we're tiny little babies who cry about everything, we're here because we can feel it in our hearts and we turn to the person next to us and we see them smiling from the bottom of their fucking soul about the same thing that is making you happy in this very fucking moment.
And in a world where it is so dangerous to have empathy, in a time when it is so dangerous to feel bad, to feel pain, to feel hurt, because there is so much of it around us, all the time. When we look at the news, when we turn on the TV there's just pain fucking everywhere it's so hard to feel something.
But you guys remind me that it's okay that I do, because when I do it, we do it together, and that is why I'm here.
It feels so weird to be on this fuckin' stage. A good weird, um. Let's make it even weirder.We go together
Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feelin' heat in December when you're 'round me
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious
I'm a sucker for you
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
'Cause I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you, 'bout you, 'bout you
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
'Cause it's true, I'm a sucker for you
Don't complicate it
'Cause I know you and you know everything about me
I can't remember, yeah, all of the nights
I can't remember when you're 'round me
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious
I'm a sucker for you
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
'Cause I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you, about you, about you
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain

I'm a sucker for you
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
'Cause I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you, about you, about you
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
All the subliminal things
No one knows about you, about you, about you
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for youThank you. Fuck! Fuck!
I know I've talked a lot tonight, but if you've been to another concert of mine then you may notice that I'm actually talking considerably less than usual.
Usually, by now there's someone in like the sixth row who's like "Shut the fuck up! Stop talking, play your songs! Play 'Closer'"
I'm not fucking playing "Closer." 
When I was nineteen years old I was living here and um, I know you've heard this story a million times but that's how I got my name, um, Halsey.
And uh, there's one song in particular... there's one song in particular that really defines what it feels like for me to be here, and to play a show here.
And I think you guys might know it.Uh, you guys are, you guys are batshit crazy.
So, I just wanna tell you guys something. I try really fucking hard, every day, to be the person that you guys believe that I am. And, it's not easy all the time. Sometimes I fuck it up, and I, I make mistakes.
But I want you to know before I leave you that, um, every single time that I'm on this stage all I can think is, I have absolutely no idea why you picked me.
And sometimes, I look at other musicians, I look at my peers, I look at my idols and I think to myself, wow, they are made of some kind of stardust that I am not madе of and never will be madе of.
But it's times like this when I get onstage in a baggy fuckin' Pearl Jam t-shirt ... I've got nothing but my band, and some lights, and I know I'm not hitting every fuckin' note, and I know that I'm running out of breath, and I know that I'm talking far too much... and you guys fucking cheer anyway. I fucking love you. Thank you.
You know what that means, right?Well, as you guys obviously heard from Subrata De and  Sandra Gelbard, I gave a speech a couple of months ago at the women’s march which means I am the speech girl now. So I hope you weren’t expecting something too eloquent because I am winging this one as it is very close to my heart.
When I was 20 years old, I was just starting out as a musician and I was in the time of my life when everything was kind of make-it-or-break-it and one night I was in Chicago, I was playing The Vic Theater and I was doing an event for Vevo, which is a really large social media platform. 33 million impressions which is a number I will never forget, because that night in Chicago, I had a miscarriage. I was 20 years old. I didn't even know I was pregnant and I had a miscarriage. I remember laying in a bed in a hotel room with a towel between my legs, bleeding and staring at my very young, very scared, very male managers who had no idea what was going on and I remember them looking at me and saying, "I mean, it’s 33 million impressions, this concert is kind of a big deal." So, I had a choice to make in that moment which was, whether I was going to let this experience play out the way it was probably supposed to, or if I was going to get out there and go on that stage. So I took a Percocet and put on an adult incontinence diaper and I wore a long t-shirt that would cover it and I got on stage and I performed in front of about 1,200 screaming teenage girls. There's videos of it online, if you want to go watch.
It was in that moment that I realized that part of being a woman and dealing with reproductive health is being treated like you’re not a human, is being treated like you’re a robot and you’re supposed to wake up every day and get over it. But it was also in that moment that I realized that I could overcome anything and that if I wanted to pursue this career and I wanted this pursue this path, there was absolutely nothing that was going to get in my fucking way, excuse my language.
I went to Planned Parenthood after because I was 20 years old and I was a struggling musician and we don't make a lot of money when you’re 20 years old and a struggling musician. Planned Parenthood was the only place that I knew that was safe, that I knew I could trust, that I could be treated like a person and given options and information and that is where I went. Shout out Planned Parenthood. And the biggest question was, why me at 20 years old? Perfectly healthy, able body, why would I have a miscarriage? And it was in that process that I found out that I had endometriosis and I had had painful periods my whole life. But it was something that I was kind of told was just something that women in our family deal with. I was told I was sensitive or over dramatic. I remember when I had my first job as a hostess at a restaurant and I remember clearing a table and taking a tray back into the kitchen and collapsing to the floor and rushing to the hospital and there was a lot of misdiagnoses along the way, PCOS, which I am sure a lot of people are familiar with as well but nobody really knew what was going on until I had that miscarriage.
And it was shortly after that I met my current OB-GYN who is Dr. Aliabadi, out in LA and she is really, really incredible and she is one of my best friends because we see a lot of each other . I didn't know what was going on when I got my diagnosis and I had spent a lifetime tucking my tampons into the sleeve of my sweatshirt when I would go to the bathroom, god forbid anybody knew that I was menstruating because it was like the most shameful thing of all time. And now there was this. So, you take the most embarrassing thing that can happen to a woman, which is having a period, and you make it worse and that is a really tough pill to swallow.
I was 21 and was realizing that there is a possibility that I wouldn’t be able to have kids and I spoke about it, I told my fans what I was going through about my diagnosis. I implored them to speak with their physicians and that if they were going through painful menstrual cycles, they needed to speak up because it’s not normal to be having such pain. If you’re staying home from work, if you’re staying home from school, that is not normal and you need to speak up and you need to ask your physicians to take you seriously. And what happened afterwards was kind of amazing. Because hundreds, maybe even thousands of young people started coming to my concerts and coming to my meet and greets and telling me that because I drew their attention to endometriosis they were diagnosed and people were catching this disease and young people who were 16, 17, 18 years old, which means there was so much hope for them. There was hope for them to not live a life that was not full of pain and this was something they wouldn’t have known about if I didn't post a tweet one day.
And it seemed so simple but it was a scary thing to do because as soon as I did it, oh boy, did the world flock in. Everyone wanted to know, who was the father of the baby that I miscarried, was I ever going to be able to have kids, does this mean I was infertile, what is endometriosis. Everyone just wanted to pick and pick and pick apart of me and I was already feeling very, very vulnerable. Part of endometriosis is that it can feel like a direct attack on your womanhood. I was very fatigued and was fainting backstage at my concerts and I was bleeding and I was pissed off at the whole world. I was like, why is this happening to me? What did I do to deserve this? My god! Just because I had sex before marriage, this is what I get, seriously? Because I will take it all back, I really will.
But in the process of having everyone pick me apart and feeling so insecure, feeling less of a woman 'cause I couldn't be intimate with my boyfriend, because I couldn't go out when my friends wanted me to, because I was dealing with digestion problems, and bleeding problems and fainting and all of the other amazing things that come along with having endo. It was really hard to feel like that confident, 20 something-year-old girl who wanted to get on the stage with her middle finger held high and make everyone sing along with her. I had surgery a year ago in January and since then, I have felt a lot better. I really have. I had the laparoscopic diagnostic surgery and endometriosis ablation. And I walked the red carpet at the Grammy’s with stitches in my stomach. There is that. And I have made a lot of friends now that I am able to go out and do stuff. I am in a new relationship with someone that loves me and understands me and is passionate and caring about what I have gone through but I still wake up every day and I am scared that if I become that sick girl again that all of those people will go away. That fear, it's gonna haunt me for the rest of my life, that if I get sick again, if I get bad like I was, that my friends aren’t going to understand, that my partner is not going to understand, that everybody is going to give up on me because I am a lot easier to deal with when I am healthy than I am when I am sick.
But it’s being places like here and hearing the stories of other women who have been through what I have been through and seeing the smiles on their face and watching them walk in beautiful dresses. And watching them be here with their children, their miracle children that they are so happy to have. It's these experiences that give me hope and make me proud to be sharing my story and knowing that because I am talking about it and because I am not ashamed of it, and because I am proud of it that more women are in this world hopefully can catch their diagnosis early or wake up one day and realize that the pain they're living with is not normal and that hopefully they can live a pain free life because of it. And I hope that more attention will come to research, to treatment because 1 in 10 women is way too fucking many.
You have to forgive me, I'm emotional and also obviously very hormonal so. I knew I was going to cry. I am really lucky, I get on stage every night in a little white costume mind you and I work my ass off and to any of my fans and friends and people listening to me who may not know anything about me or never heard a song, if you’re struggling with endometriosis or any chronic illness for that matter, you need to know it’s not something that it’s not something that makes you weak. It’s a battle that you've overcome and every battle that you’re in helps you win the war at the end of the day. Keep talking to your friends, keep supporting your loved ones, to the women in your life, make sure that they don’t feel ashamed to talk about their reproductive rights, to talk about their reproductive experiences, because the only way for this—for us to gain control of this—is to speak about it. I am so honored to be here and to be supporting my endo sisters in the room, around the world, I can’t thank you guys enough. Keep fucking fighting.I bet you're from out west somewhere

Already told you I'm right here
I will stay by your side every night
I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
Ah, ah

You know you can cryYou were dancing in your tube socks in our hotel room
Flashing those eyes like highway signs
Light one up and hand it over, rest your head upon my shoulder
I just wanna feel your lips against my skin
White sheets, bright lights, crooked teeth, and the nightlife
You told me this is right where it begins
But your lips hang heavy underneath me
And I promised myself I wouldn't let you complete me
I'm trying not to let it show, that I don't want to let this go
Is there somewhere you can meet me?
'Cause I clutched your arms like stairway railings
And you clutchеd my brain and eased my ailing
You're writing linеs about me, romantic poetry
Your girl's got red in her cheeks
'Cause we're something she can't see
And I try to refrain, but you're stuck in my brain
And all I do is cry and complain, because second's not the same
I'm sorry but I fell in love tonight
I didn't mean to fall in love tonight
You're looking like you fell in love tonight
Could we pretend that we're in love?
I'm sorry that I fell in love tonight
I didn't mean to fall in love tonight
You're looking like you fell in love tonight
Could we pretend that we're in love?

Can I get a spotlight or what, c'mon!
Thank you, goodnight!Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love 
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one 
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love 
But you can't blame me for tryin'

Okay, okay
You earned it
Would you bleed for me?
Lick it off my lips like you needed me?
Would you sit me on a couch with your fingers in my mouth?
You look so cool when you're reading me
Let's cause a little trouble
Oh, you make me feel so weak
I bet you kiss your knuckles
Right before they touch my cheek
But I'vе got my mind made up this time
'Cause thеre's a menace in my bed
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
Can you see his silhouette?
And I've got my mind made up this time
Go on and light a cigarette
Set a fire in my head
Set a fire in my head tonight
Would you lie for me?
Cross your sorry heart and hope to die for me?
Would you pin me to a wall?
Would you beg or would you crawl?
Stick a needle in your hungry eyes for me?
Let's cause a little trouble
Oh, you make me feel so weak
I bet you kiss your knuckles
Right before they touch my cheek
But I've got my mind made up this time

You told me you were gonna get me
Don't forget me, don't forget me
I wouldn't leave you if you

Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I'll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old
You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue
You were a vision in the morning when the light came through
I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you
You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors

Everything is blueI keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep
My hands wrapped around a stick shift
Swerving on the 405, I can never keep my eyes off this
My neck, the feeling of your soft lips
Illuminated in the light, bouncing off the exit signs I missed
All we do is drive
All we do is think about the feelings that we hide
All we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
Sick and full of pride, all we do is drive
And California never felt like home to me
And California nevеr felt like home
And California nеver felt like home to me
Until I had you on the open road and now we're singing
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah
You guys aren't new here so you know what to during this part, right?
You know what to do during this part
And if you don't you better learn fast
Your laugh echoes down the highway
Carves into my hollow chest, spreads over the emptiness, it's bliss
It's so simple but we can't stay
Overanalyze again, would it really kill you if we kissed?
All we do is drive
All we do is think about the feelings that we hide
All we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
Sick and full of pride, all we do is drive
And California never felt like home to me
And California never felt like home
And California never felt like home to me
Until I had you on the open road and now we're singing
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah

I missed you guysFound you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close
I was afraid to leave you on your own
Said I'd catch you if you fall
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Live without me
Go on and live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah
I gave love 'bout a hundred tries
Just runnin' from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind
Said I'd catch you if you fall
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Live without me
Go on and live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah
You don't have to say just what you did
I already know
I had to go and find out from them
So tell me, how's it feel?
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Live without me
Live without me
'Cause baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeahI found God, I found him in a lover
When his hair falls in his face
And his hands so cold they shake
I found the devil, found him in a lover
And his lips like tangerines
In his color-coded speak
Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets
I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this pricе
He's coming down, down, coming down
I found a martyr, he told me that I'd nеver
With his educated eyes
And his head between my thighs
I found a savior, I don't think he remembers
'Cause he's off to pay his crimes
And he's got no time for mine
But now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets
I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
Every single night pray the sun will rise
Every single time make a compromise
Every single night pray the sun will rise, but
Oh, he's coming down, down, coming down
He's coming down, down, coming down
Oh, he's coming down, down, coming down
Oh, he's coming down, down, coming down

Do you call yourself a fucking hurricane like me?
Do you call yourself a fucking hurricane like me?
Oh yeah
Ah!
You better lose your fucking minds
Are you insane like me? Been in pain like me?
Bought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me?
Just to pour that motherfucker down the drain like me?
Would you use your water bill to dry the stain like me?
Are you high enough without the Mary Jane like me?
Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?
Do the people whisper 'bout you on the train like me?
Saying that you shouldn't waste your pretty face like me?
And all the people say
"You can't wake up, this is not a dream
You're part of a machine, you are not a human being
With your face all made up, living on a screen
Low on self-esteem, so you run on gasoline"
I think there's a flaw in my code
These voices won't leave me alone
Well my heart is gold and my hands are cold
Are you deranged like me? Are you strange like me?
Lighting matches just to swallow up the flames like me?
Do you call yourself 
Pointing fingers 'cause you'll never take the blame like me?
And all the people say
"You can't wake up, this is not a dream
You're part of a machine, you are not a human being
With your face all made up, living on a screen

Well, is this fine? Will it be alright?
They think I'm insane, they think my lover is strange
But I don't have to fucking tell them anything 
And I'm gonna write it all down, and I'm gonna sing it on stage
But I don't have to fucking tell you anything, anything
That's the beauty of a secret
Oh, you know you're supposed to keep it
That's the beauty of a secret
That's the beauty of a secret
You know you're supposed to keep it
I don't have to fucking tell you anything, anythingThis is one of the most important songs I've ever written
They sent me away to find them a fortune
A chest filled with diamonds and gold
The house was awake with shadows and monsters
The hallways, they echoed and groaned
I sat alone, in bed 'til the morning
I'm crying, "They're coming for me"
And I tried to hold these secrets inside me
My mind's like a deadly disease
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
Goddamn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?
I paced around for hours on empty
I jumped at the slightest of sounds
And I couldn't stand the person inside me
I turned all the mirrors around
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
Goddamn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?
And I'm well acquainted with villains that live in my bed
They beg me to write them so they'll never die when I'm dead
And I've grown familiar with villains that live in my head
They beg me to write them so I'll never die when I'm dead
When I'm dead
I'm bigger than my body
And I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
Goddamn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
Goddamn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?
And all the kids cried out, "Please stop, you're scaring me"
I can't help this awful energy
Goddamn right, you should be scared of me
Who is in control?There's a place way down in Bed Stuy
Where the boy lives behind bricks
He's got an eye for girls of eighteen
And he turns them out like tricks
I went down to a place in Bed Stuy
A little liquor on my lips
I let him climb inside my body
And held him captive in my kiss
'Cause there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in thе pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
I'm a hurricane
I'm a hurricane
See, I wеnt down to a place in Brooklyn
Where you tripped on LSD
And there I found myself reminded
To keep you far away from me
'Cause there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting
 I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
I'm a hurricane
I'm a hurricane
I'm a hurricane
This song is a reminder that you do not belong to anybody but yourself
He says, "Oh, baby, beggin' you to save me
Though lately, I like 'em crazy
Oh, maybe, you could devastate me
Little lady, come and fade me"
I'm a wanderess, I'm a one night stand
Don't belong to no city, don't belong to no man
I'm the violence in the pouring rain
Come and fade me
Come and fade me
Oh, I'm a hurricane
Come and fade me
Oh, I'm a hurricane
Come and fade me
I'm a hurricane
I can't even begin to tell you guys, like, what it's like to be inside my body right now up on this stage
I literally recognize almost every single person in hereHe says, "Ooh, baby girl, you know we're gonna be legends
I'm the king and you're the queen and we will stumble through heaven
If there's a light at the end, it's just the sun in your eyes
I know you wanna go to heaven, but you're human tonight"
And I've been sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool
For a while now, drowning my thoughts out with the sounds
And do you feel like a young god?
You know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
And they're running, running, running
And do you feel like a young god?
You know the two of us arе just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with thе people underneath
And they're running, running, running
Again
And we'll be running, running, running
Again
And we'll be running, running, running
He says, "Ooh, baby girl, don't get cut on my edges
I'm the king of everything and my fucking tongue is a weapon
There's a light in the crack that's separating your thighs
And if you wanna go to heaven, you should fuck me tonight"
But I've been sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool
For a while now, drowning my thoughts out with the sounds, oh
But do you feel like a young god?
You know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
And they're running, running, running
But do you feel like a young god?
You know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
And they're running, running, running
Again
And we'll be running, running, running
Again
And we'll be running, running, running
'Cause ooh, baby girl
I'm the king of everything
And there's a light in the crack
And if you wanna go to heaven, you should fuck me tonight
Do you feel like a young god?
You know the two of us are just young gods
And we'll be flying through the streets with the people underneath
And they're running, running, running
But do you feel like a young god?
You know the two of us are just young gods
Again
Thank youI'm searching for something that I can't reach
I don't like them innocent, I don't want no face fresh
Want them wearing leather, begging, let me be your taste test
I like the sad eyes, bad guys, mouth full of white lies
Kiss me in the corridor, but quick to tell me goodbye
You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I like it anyway
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?
You're a Rolling Stone boy, never-sleep-alone boy
Got a million numbers and they're filling up your phone, boy
I'm off the deep end, sleepin' all night through the weekend
Saying that I love him but I know I'm gonna leave him
You say that you're no good for me
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve
And I swear I hate you when you leave
But I 
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?
I'm searching for something that I can't reach
My ghost, where'd you go?
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me
My ghost, where'd you go?
What happened to the soul that you used to be?Do you remember the taste of my lips that night
I stole a bit of my mother's perfume?
'Cause I remember when my father put his fist through the wall
That separated the dining room
And I remember the fear in your eyes
The very first time we snuck into the city pool
Late December, with my heart in my chest
And the clouds of my breath
Didn't know where we were running to
Don't look back
'Cause we'll be looking for sunlight or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
So for now, let's get away
On a Roman holiday
Could you imagine the taste of your lips
If we never tried to kiss on the drive to Queens?
'Cause I'll imagine the weight of your ribs
If you lie between my hips in the backseat
I imagine the tears in your eyes
The very first night I'll sleep without you
And when it happens I'll be miles away
And a few months late
Didn't know where I was running to
But I didn't look back
And we'll be looking for sunlight or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
So, for now, let's get away
On a Roman holiday
Feet first, don't fall
Or we'll be running again
Keep close, stand tall
'Cause we'll be looking for sunlight or the headlights
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
But for now, let's get away
On a Roman holiday
Arianna, everybodyMy demons are begging me to open up my mouth
I need them, mechanically make the words come out
They fight me, vigorous and angry watch them pounce
Ignite me, licking up the flames they bring about
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He's got me down on both knees
But it's the devil that's tryna
Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock mе out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Sеlfish, taking what I want, and call it mine
I'm helpless, clinging to a little bit of spine
They rush me, telling me I'm running out of time
They shush me , walking me across a fragile line
I sold my soul to a three-piece 
And he told me I was holy 
He's got me down on both knees 
But it's the devil that's tryna
Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
So hold me down now
Hold me down now
Hold me down
I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He's got me down on both knees
But it's the devil that's tryna
Hold me down, hold me down
Sneaking out the back door, make no sound
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Hold me down, hold me down
Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown
Knock me out, knock me out
Saying that I want more, this is what I live for
Let's go all the way backYour little brother never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I'll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old
You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise 
And you're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and thе ink, mm
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covеred in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
But he's blue
And he's blue
You were a vision in the morning when the light came through
I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you
He said, "You'll never be forgiven 'til your boys are too"
And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you
You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
Oh, you're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the

And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
But he's blue
And he's blue
You were red, and you liked me because I was blue
But you touched me, and suddenly I was a lilac sky
Then you decided purple just wasn't for you
Now everything is blue
His pills 
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue

Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna make you cry
I'll be damned if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before they dry
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna make you cry
I'll be damned if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before they dry
Keep my friends close, but this pretty girl closer
Kiss her on the neck, little baby is a poser
Thinks she's so cold, but the world is colder
Take her in my lap and I'll promise that I'll hold her
My bed is too big for only me
I keep a pistol when I sleep
Inside my mouth so I can shoot
Down all the bad things
You know I tell her all the time
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna make you cry
I'll be damned if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before they dry
You know I tell her all the time
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna make you cry
I'll be damned if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before they dry
Hurts so bad but it's digging in my shoulder
Make me so mad, but I'm keeping my composure
Got your naked pictures and I keep them in a folder
Know if I delete 'em I'll regret it when I'm older
My bed is too big for only me
I keep a pistol when I sleep
Inside my mouth so I can shoot
Down all the bad things
You know I tell her all the time
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna make you cry
I'll be damned if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before they dry
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby
Nothing's gonna make you cry
I'll be damned if I ever let another hand
Wipe your tears before they dry
My bed is too big
My bed is too big for onlyLook at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl, the girl who has everything?
Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Looking around here you think
"Sure, she's got everything"
I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs? I've got twenty!
But who cares? No big deal, I want more
I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see them dancin'
Walking around on those - what do you call 'em? Oh - feet!
Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a - what's that word again? Street
Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free - wish I could be
Part of that world
What would I give if I could live out of these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
Bet'cha on land they understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women sick of swimmin'
Ready to stand
I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it - what's the word? Burn?
When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?
Out of the sea, wish I could be part of that worldWanna believe, wanna believe
That you don't have a bad bone in your body
But the bruises on your ego make you go wild, wild, wild, yeah
Wanna believe, wanna believe
That even when you're stone cold, you're sorry
Tell me why you gotta be so outta your mind, yeah
I know you're chokin' on your fears
Already told you I'm right here
I will stay by your side every night
I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
Ah
I know you need, I know you need
The upper hand even when we aren't fighting
'Cause in the past, you had to prepare every time, yeah
Don't wanna leave, don't wanna leave
But if you're gonna fight, then do it for me
I know you're built to love, but broken down, so just try, yeah
I know you're chokin' on your fears
Already told you I'm right here
I will stay by your side every night
I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
Ah
I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair
Going sick in the head, tryna get you there
And I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair
It's not fair

And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love

Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
AhI wanna start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way
No, you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so fucking far
That you would never ever touch me again
Won't see your alligator tears
'Cause know I've had enough of them
I feel so sad
You should be sad
You should be
You should be
You should be
You should be
You should be sad
You should be
You should be sad
You should be
You should be
You should be
I'm gonna start this out by saying 
I really meant well from the start
Take a broken man right in my hands
And then put back all his parts
But you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
Just glad I made it out without breaking down
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
'Bout who you are
I feel so sad
You should be sad
You should be
You should be
You should be
'Cause you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
I feel so sad
You should be sad
You should beMm

        She doesn't kiss me on the mouth anymore
'Cause it's more intimate, than she thinks we should get
She doesn't look me in the eyes anymore
Too scared of what she'll see, somebody holding me
When I wake up all alone
And I'm thinking of your skin
I remember, I remember what you told me
Said that we're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
We're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
She doesn't call me on the phone anymore
She's never listening, she says it's innocent
She doesn't let me have control anymore
I must've crossed a line, I must've lost my mind
When I wake up all alone
And I'm thinking of your skin
I remember, I remember what you told me
Said that we're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
We're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
I miss the mornings with you laying in my bed
I miss the memories replaying in my head
I miss the thought of a forever, you and me
But all you're missing is my body, oh
'Cause we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all
We're not lovers, we're just strangers
With the same damn hunger
To be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all 
To feel anything at all
To feel anything at all

        A shining badge, a suit to match
Bit my nails down so they wouldn't scratch
But who believes with knees like these?
I'll take two of 'em, please
With soft skin, soft eyes
All these beautiful laughs and beautiful thighs
They always kept me up at night
But I can't change my appetite
'Cause your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be a better man
It doesn't matter to me
Yeah, your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be a better man
It doesn't matter to me
'Cause he is she is her
And her and he are love
And I have never felt the difference
'Cause he is she is her
And her and he are love
Tired of all these labels
And my girl, she always wore a skirt in the classroom
Eatin' my dessert in the bathroom
Can't get caught, so we stiller than a statue
Bad news, think I'll probably die before I have you
Soft skin, soft eyes
All these beautiful laughs and beautiful thighs
They always kept me up at night
But l live for lovin' impolite
'Cause your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be a better man
It doesn't matter to me
Yeah, your pussy is a wonderland
And I could be a better man
It doesn't matter to me

His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue
Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I'll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old
You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blueEverything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
