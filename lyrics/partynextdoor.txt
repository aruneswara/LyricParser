Doesn't make sense now
Shit just got real, things are gettin' intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout "We" a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like "Do you wanna hang right now?"
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's askin' a lot of you right now
All she talkin' bout is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she ever say is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
I been up for two whole days thinkin' what I did to keep you goin'
Thumbin' through the voicemails that you left me tellin' me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded, no 
And I believed you when they told me don't
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you
Swear these days all you say is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she hit me with is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once, oh
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
Why you gotta start, girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standin' in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questionin' what you get out the deal
Doin' things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm comin' home?
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking like inside of your place
Or how it's decorated
This thing is gettin' one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now
Yeah
All she talkin' bout is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she hit me with is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"Gotta get real again, gotta get real again, oh

Pay homage, I roll through the city like young Sheikh Mohammed
It can't be that hard to find us
Go to Jungle, pick up my Ethiopian goddess
That's when words spread, a Bugatti is in the projects
The boy home, used to take the bus to the block
Now summertime whips come through and bust up the block
I remember seeing Nikk's having to bust up a block
And sell the work right to hush, y'all niggas must have forgot
But I was there Nas don shit, a couple things sit on my conscience
With that said, look at all we accomplished
Yea, sure this ain't Compton but this ain't a fairytale land neither
We all lost mad people, the city wild
They gave the task to a purposeful child
Verses start to get a little more personal now
But that’s cause everybody else sound is so played out though
Oliver North in the cut Dolce'd out though
A thousand dollar bottle it get poured straight out though
I'm screaming OVO on the whole way out though
I'm back boy for real, I'm that boy for real

The opposite of your hero
The make up, the breakup was see-through
The way I did you was illegal
Your girl was right, yeah, she called it
You should believe in your people
Tucked you, then went to the strip club
VIP, I got my dick sucked
Came back to you and I kissed ya
That led to fucking on the tour bus
Packed up and went back to Oakland
Finally, it's out in the open
I gave you the hope, you did the hopin'
Don't hold your breath 
Don't wait on my love 
Don't hold your breath 
Don't wait on my love

Sex's the last thing that's on your mind
Covered in makeup
Swear the prettiest things are hardest to find
Girl I'm still lookin' for you
Where could you be? Prolly somewhere in the UV
Tip-toein' out the whip cause you had too much to sip
Might as well be like me, take your time, let the liquor sit
Girl, I will wait for you
I will wait for you
Girl, I will wait for you
To get in the right state of mind
Girl, girl I need you, gotta see you
, got to take it 
Good girl, I hit nice and slow
Good girl, I hit nice
Good girl, I hit niceCut 'em off, like Korean barbecue scissors
I wear expensive Cartier frames, they ain't see the vision
I could do it all by myself, no assistance
And I could do it all by myself with no assistance
Everyone that and this, but don't take risk
If you don't use your gift, you could lose your gift
All you gotta do is work, but choose your shift
If you don't got drive like me, you better find your lift
It's a different breeze that I blow
I was chasing waterfalls
I got good at being rich
I was great at being broke
Tryna tell me, what to do
You don't know what to do
If you knew the next move
You'd be me and not you
Being damaged your nice image
Gotta refuse all empathy
Gotta refuse all sympathy
Everybody’s fine till they need me financially
I'm a legend, if I go deceased
Call me crazy, when I get to a preaching
Kuwait, Kuwait, Bugatti
Diamonds
Yuh, yuh, yuh
Cut 'em off, like Korean barbecue scissors
I wear expensive Cartier frames, they ain't see the vision
I could do it all by myself, no assistance
And I could do it all by myself, with no assistance
They ain't know me then, I bet they know me now
Dead weight ain't do nothing, but slow me down
Pure confidence, straight dominance
Need no co-defendants, no accomplices
No more guarantees, no more promises
Left wrist is Tourbillon, you know, what time it is
Waitin' to see if you arrived yet
They 'ont see the vision, they ain't get they eyes checked
Too many opinions make it hard for you
But really who better for the job than you?
Clip the noise now, I live a sound life
I just bet it on myself and double down twice
Cut 'em off, like Korean barbecue scissors
I wear expensive Cartier frames, they ain't see the vision
I could do it all by myself, no assistance
And I could do it all by myself, with no assistance
Catch me on the The One
Rule number one
Don't trust a nigga, who don't got brothers, who say, bruh
Rule number two
The niggas quick to say a leisure the quickest to say, fuck you
Rule number three
If you got money better stick with stick with a condom
Rule number four
Don't trust with a bitch, you just met who wanna cuddle
I'ma give you a couple
I get paid in a duffle
I chose money not fame
So they payin' me double
Selling hits off my mumbles
It's so hard to be humble
It's okay to be ballin'
Nigga, just don't fumble
 at the crib
Step up the chips
My bible is my life jacket
I bring a bic to the bridges
Let's bring a bitch to the clinic
My lifestyle is so expensive
My ice all on my senses
Sorry for not being sensitive
Cut 'em off, like Korean barbecue scissors
I wear expensive Cartier frames, they ain't see the vision
I could do it all by myself, no assistance
And I could do it all by myself, with no assistanceLyrics from 12/7/2020 IG Live

Shopping spree after shopping spree I go

Hence love's blind, I guess danger gets me excited
I am on a threesome diet right now, baby
I'm taking trips to Miami traveling down seven keys
Ducking off, sipping Grey Geese
Never thought you bring these actions out me
Never thought you had my head on a leash
Never thought you had my heart tryna leak out
Saying things I never speak about
I'ma handle it just like a man
Popping bottles just because I can
Ain't gone never change who I am
Kumbaya, I'ma still do my dance
And handle mine
I'ma handle mine, you're not mine

Yes, it's supposed to be, a big savage did that
They said you used to be the one, now you took two steps back
But I'm too rich for that to happen, whoa whoa
Like Ali, I'ma bounce back off the ropes
In my Jordan years, Jordan with the tongue
In my Kobe years, hitting 81
And I'm going gold, find a badder one
Let the check blow, now that's platinum
I'ma recoup, buy the blue coupe
Bought a new house, that's a new roof
I'ma make lemonade out of lemons, got a sweet tooth
And I learn from my truths
And learn from my last
And learn from my past
I knew this won't last
Just tell me quick fast
So I can handle it just like a man
Popping bottles just because I can
Ain't gone never change who I am
Kumbaya, I'ma still do my dance
And handle mine
I'ma handle mine, you're not mine
But God damn, it's about time you define what we is

This a big house and the mortgage ain't cheap
And I don't flash what I own shawty
'Cause I don't lease, no way
My catalouge is legend, might leave  for one or two seconds
But it's tick tick tock, tick tock
My fiancé don't buy 
Girl you know I got a girl at home but you still tryna get me in trouble

Momma still insist
Riding with them niggas, broken smiles is hard to fix
Skinny niggas turn to big niggas real quick
Jealousy is one hell of a drug, my dick
That ain't in my blood bitch
Paint the pavement in my Timbalands
Wonder if I would drop, now we yelling "Timber!" man
Police let me slide cause I'm riding for my city
If this don't make the album, then the album ain't this gritty
Ethan told me I'd be good, we was 'bout to sign for 20 G's
How that supposed to last when I'm riding with 'bout twenty G's?
Half the time embarrassed cause this lame nigga's an enemy
His ride's about to ride out, he's talking 'bout he's ending me
Drop a tape late, imagine if that shit drop tomorrow?
Five months ahead of these niggas, my shit just hit the charts
Cold chicken with the coldest wine, we ain't living life
Steak dinners for the side piece, that's just a side piece
Lord have mercy, my lord
Please don't let the sheriff check the back of my Ford
Bad bitch in the front, quit playing with my cords
Realize I'm OMO, OMO where I'm going
Me and Jay Wray talk about every day, that's crazy man
Back when it was just a dream, ain't that crazy man?
That's why my circle stay tighter than the grip on stolen lighters

You should believe in your people
Tucked you, then went to the strip club
V.I.P., I got my dick sucked

Cause there wouldn't be conversation

One night, while I’m on the road
Your voice can paint pictures to the blind, and smoke can bring the sun to the sunrise
I see your face , every time I fall asleep 
Cause the angels call my name , and tell me that you’re at peace
Oh no

And I can’t wait , to see your face 
To see your smile , I ain't seen in a while 
So baby I cannot wait
I know your momma thinks I’m way to occupied, to have a girl up in my busy life
But I promise I’mma stick it through, no matter no matter what I got to do
And girl, trust that I got time, enough time to keep a smile on your face
Your my exhale, your my escape
And baby I just can’t wait

Babe, I wanna hold your hand, babygirl I just want one touch
And lady, damn I miss your kiss, everything you did, damn I miss your hugs

I wouldn't bother God, and pray for a miracle
And all the skies are blue and there's no sign of pain
This, too, shall pass but right now it's here to wake
Nothing is perfect, nothing is normal
Is everything worth it, being this formal?
Losing my patience, is there any time?
Fake till we make it, we tried it every time

Waiting on the winds
To call upon your name

You know that these streets hate me
Been like this since nineteen
And the Lord ain't on my team, to tell me what I need
I want the truth
But it might not be what's best for me
Might not be what's best for me
Wanna be your destiny
Wanna be closer than close to you, baby, oh
Baby you're so perfect to me
I want your body on mine
All day and all night
You know that these streets hate me
Been like this since nineteen
And the Lord ain't on my team, to tell me what I need
I want the truth

Might not be what's best for me
Wanna be your destiny
Wanna be closer than close to you, baby, oh
Baby you're so perfect to me
I want your body on mine
All day and all nightDidn't want to play your cards right
Thought I was your diamond 'til you broke my heart
Only wish you had your mind right
Would've told you hit the road jack from the start
All you had to do was play fair
I would've the king of spades without a care
And you know I would've been there
But I got to turn this poker game to solitaire
I said I got to turn this poker game to solitaire
I choose to fold the game is over
You wanted to play the joker
So now you're playing solitaire
I was trying to make a full house
Then you ran and made a royal flush with my love
I was trying to make it all count
Obviously it just wasn't enough
You're my castle you're my fortress
Girl your loving was the warmest
Now you're shoulder is the coldest
I'm running out of choices
But I got to turn this poker game to solitaire
I said I got to turn this poker game to solitaire
I choose to fold the game is over
You wanted to play the joker
So now you're playing solitaire
But I got to turn this poker game to solitaire

In the middle of the day I lost the words to say
"I wanna kiss you, girl, wanna hug you girl" yeah

I wanna take you by the arm, shawty, you're my lucky charm

She got me on autopilot
And we ain't really even tryna find it
But a designated Island
With a designated driver for a designated mileage
A compilation of conversations about us
A compilation of population that doubts us
And it's whatever, girl, cause I got trust
And every little thing you say, mama, cause I got us
I wanna take you by the arm, shawty, you're my lucky charm
I wanna touch your luscious lips,  I wanna make your mind drip
Baby, I'm your man, here I stand, me I'mma high on your love

But i'm old enough to put my baby above
So I do realize, the fact that you the one
So never question my decision, my love means a ton
And I ain't goin' crazy, cause this is gotta be
The most exceptional feeling that I have ever breathed
So I must honor thee, to keep her loving tender
Cause I will always keep you me your suspender
You got the heart of gold, for sure i'd rock that ice
And if you need anything, don't have to ask me twice
Cause babe I got your back, no matter how you act
Even though i'm young, I know our love can alter that
I miss those times we played games when your mom's gone
You and I, just alone
We both know something's boutta' pop off

Met her in LA, but she took her 
'Never did trust me so soon of a sudden, cause she never knew what a nigga was scheming
I told her to hit me as soon as she back
Told me she did and assumed I lost interest
'Cause she never knew a nigga just moved to Miami, 'cause we got a standard of living
I tried to tell her she needs to come visit
She hesitated 'cause it wasn't business
She about her money and clearly am I
I booked the ticket and she took the flight
Later that night, we hit the club

If shawty feel me, tell me if you feel me
If I was broke, still grindin' like I'm broke
Would you still feel me?
If feds called and said they caught me on some drugs
Would you leave me?
If I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You'd be "Where you been?"
But there'll never be emotion
You a grown ass bitch
You the realest  recognition
I'm just glad that you know

Glad that you know
