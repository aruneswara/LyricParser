Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax
I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax
I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made a mess of what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all
At all
At all, at all
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax
You say it's better if we
Love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had out my mind
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're going
Nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax

Let's go!
I was up in the club with my homies, trying to get a lil V-I
Keep it down on the low key
You should know how it feels 
I seen shorty, she was checking up on me
From the game she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she know me
I decided to chill 
Conversation got heavy
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow 
Ohh! 
She's saying, come get me
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, baby let's go
When I told her  I said
 Yeah!
Shorty got down low said, come and get me
 Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
 Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
 Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming
Yeah  yeah  yeah, yeah!
Yeah  yeah  yeah, yeah!
She's all up in my head now, got me thinking
That it might be a good idea to take her with me
'Cause she's ready to leave, ready to leave now 
And I got to keep it real now
'Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty
But that just ain't me 
'Cause I don't know, if I take that chance
Just where's it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me
The way she get low
I'm like, yeah, just work that out for me
She asks for one more dance, and I'm like, yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave
 And I say

Shorty got down low said, come and get me
 Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
 Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
 Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming
Yeah  yeah  yeah, yeah!
Yeah  yeah  yeah, yeah!
Watch out, my outfit's ridiculous
In the club looking so conspicuous
And roar, these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow 
And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth 
I won't stop 'til I get 'em in their birthday suit 
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting, then I put em on foot patrol 
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please 
Ludacris fill cups like double D's 
Me and Ursh' once more, and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed that say
 Yeah!
Shorty got down low said, come and get me
 Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
 Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
 Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming
Yeah  yeah  yeah, yeah!

I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this is coming to an end
And it's better for me to let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn
It's gonna burn for me to say this, but it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming, but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting, baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Sending pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feeling ain't the same
Find myself calling her your name
Ladies, tell me, do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now to get my shorty back?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burning 'til you return 
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn 
Let it burn , gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, ooh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burning 'til you return 
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn , let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions
Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creeping with, creeping with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keeping it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true?
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions
Sitting here, stuck on stupid, trying to figure out
When, what, and how I'ma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinking, contemplating
Be a man and get it over with, over with
I'm riding in my whip, racing to her place
Talking to myself, preparing to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come near me
I said, "One second, baby, please hear me"
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessionsOoh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ouh
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go
I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad
When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars 
Flowers, cards and candy 
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her: "I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world"
Ladies say: "I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can"
See, I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else...She got me throwing Spades Ace with that mouth
I guess only time gon' tell
You gotta give me dirty love
I guess I'm down too
When I can't find any words I lie
Look up and see the stars in a perfect line
The feeling of love is a global thing
So tell me how you feel 
Knowing I see the world when I look in your eyes
Your kisses are Duracell, they keep me energized
Tired of going back and forth, baby I'm hypnotized
You gotta a nigga on the love on the low though

A great ass, a better mind, what a combo
You know you pretty and you winning with the convo
She kinda tipsy, we been drinking, she's a light weight
She love the way I'm pull them panties in the right way
But anyway let's get back to how I've been feeling
I just love the times when I'm beside ya
Holding me down cause you're my rider

Don't be shy, come let your boy get in

Listen
See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kind of hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
Thought that she was the one for me
Til I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexing everyone, but me
This is why we could never be
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
I know it's so unfair to you 
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew
Wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me 
Whoa whoa oh oh oh oh
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you, 
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through 
This is why I just can't get with you, no no
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through

I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you
Said it ain't what you do, it's what you do tonight
And there ain’t no shortcut, to doing something right
If you knew what I knew, she’ll be yours tonight

And I promise that I'm gonna keep it coming all night long
Looking in your eyes while you on the other side

'Cause the way I'm staring at you got me wanna give it to you all night
Looking in your eyes while you on the other side
I can't take it no more, baby, I'm coming for you
You keep doing it on purpose, winding and working
If we close our eyes, it could just be me and you
I wanna make love in this club

He got you trapped, I'll set you free
Sexually, mentally, physically, emotionally
I'll be like your medicine, you'll take every dose of me
It's going down on aisle three, I'll bag you like some groceries
And every time you think about it, you gon' want some more of me
'Bout to hit the club, make a movie, yeah, rated R
Pulled up like a trap star, that's if you had your regular car
You ever made love to a thug in the club with his ice on?
87 Jeans and a fresh pair of Nikes on
On the couch, on the table, on the bar, or on the floor
You can meet me in the bathroom
Yeah, you know I'm trained to go
Might as well give me a kiss
If we keep touching like this
I know you're scared, baby, they don't know what we doing
Let's both get undressed right here
Keep it up, girl, and I swear
I'ma give it to you non-stop
And I don't care who's watching
Watching, watching
In this club, on the floor
Baby, let's make love

In this club This is what you do, this is what you do
This is what you do, this is what you do
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how...
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
What's sad is I love her, but I'm falling for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it while all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...

Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with

Just can't get through to you 
I'm never gonna tell nothing wrong 
Listen 
Now, now she loved me, shawty, I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found
I lost my way, she said she'd stay
And lately, I've been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before a great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave, but you lied to me when you said that
"Baby, no worries, I promise to get us back"
I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated
I'm trying to travel through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving mountains... 
It's like moving mountains... 
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Ooh, ooh
Be, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
She, she don't touch me, I don't touch her
We rarely even ever say a word
I really want to give her everything she deserves
But the bad took away the good
She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments
Always pissed, man I'm tired
Every kiss that I miss
Girl, you know I'm trying
You never believe when I say
And I never believe it when you say
"I love you", and I shouldn't complain about it
I should take it like a man and walk up out it
'Cause we will never be the same, ooh
I've been standing in gas and you have been the flame
I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated
I'm trying to get through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving mountains... 
It's like moving mountains... 
Baby, why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
This must be a slow death that I'm traveling on
It feels so wrong, I'm barely holding on
See, no matter what it takes
I've gotta get it together
And these hills that I'm traveling up
She ain't showing me love
I'm down on my love
Oh, I'm down, whoa
I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated
I'm trying to travel through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving a mountain
Steady trying to move this mountain
So, baby, why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?

Love don't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep lovin' anyway
We laugh and we cry and we break
And we make our mistakes
If there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
I'm willing to wait for it
Then, I'm willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher, preacher, preacher, preacher
But there are things that the homilies and hymns won't teach ya, teach ya, teach ya, teach ya
My mother was a genius, genius, my father commanded respect, respect
When they died they left no instructions, just a legacy to protect
Death don’t discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
Yeah, we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
If there’s a reason I’m still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I’m willing to wait for it
Then I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it...
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
I am the one thing in life I can control
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
I am inimitable, I am original
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
I am not falling behind or running late
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
I am not standing still, I am lying in wait
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
Everyone faces an endless uphill climb
You got something to prove, you got nothing to lose
Everyone’s pace is relentless, you waste no time, time
What is it like in his shoes?
Life don't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
Taking me, taking me, taking...
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
But I know there's a reason I'm alive
So many have died
And I'm still waiting for it
I'm willing to wait for it
Life don’t discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break

Yeah listen
Baby, I know we said it's best we don't talk no more
But I got to get it off my chest 'bout all the shit I've been hearing, babe
I, I thought you were that ride or die, you would never leave my side
I even made you out to be the woman that I will be with for life
I took in your kid, did everything that you wanted me to
Now I'm in the shit about you fronting on radio interviews
Do it make you feel good to lie, even though I know you wanna cry?
Hey, if you were gonna tell it, then you should've everything instead of making me the bad guy
If you got nothing good to say, then don't say nothing
'Cause if I really start talking, it'll be something
So you cheated, I cheated, so be it
We need to leave it alone, move on... 
Hold up
Hello, you got a collect call from Clinton Correctional Facility. Will you accept the charges?
Yes, I'll accept it
What's up?
Sitting in my cell, head about to burst
Wouldn't be alive if I didn't shoot first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
But I'd be in the grave if I didn't let it spray
I never said that I was perfect 
Nobody walking on this earth is 
That night, I would've got murdered
If I ain't grab the ratchet and let them cowards have it
Uh, listen up, listen up, listen up, world
Listen up, listen up, listen up, world
Uh, I gotta confess
This is the hottest remix I ever did in my life
So So Def
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all 
Damn near cried when I got that phone call 
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give part two of my confessions
I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus Coupe
Your homie said she saw me, but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've been just telling you the truth
And I confess about the days
I was rolling my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field, still looking for a thrill
And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real 
And I confess that just when I thought I could really try to get away
Or have another woman on the side
But I never knew that it would catch up with a nigga one day
You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson
If you stay with me, then it'll be a blessing
No stressing, it'll never be no guessing
'Cause I'm pouring out my heart and these are my confessions
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way 
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all 
Damn near cried when I got that phone call 
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give part two of my confessions
Damn, how did she bring it up? How did she break it down?
Man, you at the clinic? Dog, slow down, that's your child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheating
And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
And you know it ain't y'all little secret
You famous, you can't go nowhere
'Cause everytime you go there, there's hoes there
So basically, you and your girl over
And I know when she broke the news
You told her, "Man, don't say that"
Matter fact, like Pat, don't say jack
Every time a nigga sitting on pay stacks
Things come up from way, way, way back
Way back, way back
Way, way back, way back
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way 
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all 
Damn near cried when I got that phone call 
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give part two of my confessions
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do 
To tell you, the woman I love 
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know 
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this 
And hopefully you'll give me another chance Y'all know what this is!

Intoxicated, your vibe's amazing
Feel the love in the air, baby, you know

In my career
And every lover
In and out my life, I've hit, love and left the tears
Without a care
Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I can't figure it out, why...

Got me feeling it 
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so 
Got me feeling it 
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold on me
Let me go, baby
Now, listen...
My mama told me
Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around
Same old song
But I was so sure
That it wouldn't happen to me 'cause I know how to put it down
But I was so wrong
This girl was mean, she really turned me out
Her body was so tight, I'm looking for her in the daytime with a flashlight
My homies say this girl is cramping my style
And I can't figure it out, but...
I'm so 
Got me feeling it 
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted

Left the country just to spend the weekend here to fuck me
What is not the only thing that's coming
All your friends are calling you
Like "OMG your such and such is lucky"
It's touching my soul
But little does anyone know, yeah
I've been working, I ain't perfect
I don't need you to tell me "it's yours"
You know what it is I adore
And something about it that inspires me to hit it more
You told me you coming, well shit I'll just buzz you in
Keys are still under the mat by the door
Ignore the mess
My crib ain't the cleanest from company I had the evening before, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, ohI know you think I'm afraid
To take a chance
And go to the deep end
Usher, baby
Turn the lights on
These waters can get a little busy
But I got experience
Don't mind trekking to the storm
Long as I know that you're here with me
Shedding all your innocence
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise, girl, I ain't afraid
It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Loving makes you so wet
Your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met, I knew that I
That I knew I was ready, baby
To take that dive
Can't help it, no
I want you to feel me
Every little bit of me
I don't need a life saver
Baby, going deeper ain't gon' kill me
And I love the rush I get from it
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise, girl, I ain't afraid
It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Loving makes you so wet
Your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met, I knew that I
That I knew I was ready, baby
To take that dive
I'll be inside when the tides are rolling, baby
You'll be my place to hide, all night
I'm not afraid to try
And knew I don't mind playing in the rain
And I was hoping that I get to take that dive
It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Loving makes you so wet
Your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met, I knew that I
That I knew I was ready, baby
To take that diveI, mean, everybody want somebody that's got confidence
You know it's in her attitude
The way she walks, nice legs 
She's gotta be beautiful, nice thin waist 
Fat ass , ooh
And them soft little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
I wonder if your lips are as soft as I imagine them to be
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Huh, the crazy shit is you the only girl I love
Little lips, little lips, little lips
I reminisce of all of the things that don't exist yet
Like the breakfast on Sunday mornings after drunk sex
Or when you're out with your girls and you send me a drunk text
Saying "Baby, are you far, want you to come closer to my heart"
I miss you girl, whoever you are
Oh, I miss you, already
And I just wanna kiss you, already
So come on, come on, come on
If you are ready, hurry up to the home

Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips 
Pillow cases covered in traces of your makeup 
And, if I ever cheat, all she gonna taste is your flavor, real shit, ooh

Even though I can't see you so far
Looking just like the tint on my car
I miss you girl, whoever you are
Oh, I miss you, already
And I just wanna kiss you, already
So come on, come on, come on
If you are ready, hurry up to the home
You don't know I miss you already, I..
I like the way your frame is, uhh
I wonder if your sex is as good as I assume it's gon-na be, huh
The crazy shit is you already knew what it was
Take this, take that girl, but don't take time
To take my heart, baby come claim mine
Won't wait forever but I'll wait for you
Don't take too long girl 'cause I'm missing you

If you wanna know how I feel
Leave it till it's gone
I'm just saying that what don't kill
Only makes you strong
If you don't recognize what is real
Then forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time
Some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore
Let's go numb
You never know until you let go
Let's go numb

And you expecting change
Well, is that really insanity
Or just a loser's game?
I only trust in the things I feel
Some may say that's strange
You better recognize what is real
'Cause forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time
Some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore
Let's go numb
You never know until you let go
We all go numb
I can feel you now

Can you feel it?Real talk, Usher
Just Blaze, you know
Oh, oh ohh
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here wit me
You're gonna need me
And now that day's here, and your man got to shed tears
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
You never miss a good thing till it leaves you
Finally, I realized that I need you
I want you back
Baby girl, I need you back
Gotta have you back, babe
Heartbroken when you left my world
Man, I wish I would've kept my girl
I love you
I don't know what I'm gon' do without my baby
It's driving me crazy
Because I'm missing my baby
I'm going out of my mind and I'm running out of time
Oh, I just wish I could find you, girl
Said, I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needing you lately
I'm going out of my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now
Aww, baby, what you say now?
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
And still I want you, want you, want you, want you, want you
Need you, babe
If I could rewind the time and get inside your mind
I would take back all my words
I didn't see it
I couldn't see what I was doing, babe
See, baby girl, I was blind and I wish that I could try
To be the man that you deserve
Give me one chance to make it work
It's driving me crazy
Because I'm missing my baby
I'm going out of my mind and I'm running out of time
Oh, I just wish I could find you, girl
Said, I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needing you lately
I'm going out of my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
Wish I can throw it back
I want it the way it use to be
You're gonna need me
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
Give me one chance to make it work
Yo, I'm trying to stay strong, I don't wanna crack
But I need her and she told me I'm gon' want her back
Should've believed her, now I'm wishing I could throw me back
To that exact spot where we found L-O-V-E at
Lose some, then I lose again, when am I gonna win some?
I said a lot of things out of anger, but I meant some
I brought a lot of things to the table besides income
I just want things to go back to how they used to be
I was used to you and I thought you were used to me
Time is against me
You never miss something till it's gone
That's my word, ma, you convinced me
It might not happen, but I'm still hoping
And my heart is broken, but the door is still open
Pillow still soaking, your boy still locing
Dutch still lit and a bottle still open
And if I don't get another chance, it'll be hard to get focused
Give me one chance to make it work
It's driving me crazy
Because I'm missing my baby
I'm going out of my mind, I'm running out of time
I just wish I could find you, girl
Said, I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needing you lately
The love of my life
But I wasn't loving you right, baby
It's driving me crazy
Because I'm missing my baby 
I'm going out of my mind and I'm running out of time
I just wish I could find you, girl 
Said, I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needing you lately 
I'm going out of my head, all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here wit me
You're gonna need me, need me one day
And now that day's here and your man got to shed tears
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
I'm sitting by the phone, realizing she ain't ever coming home

You think I don't know what's up, but sweetheart, that's what ruined us
I ain't afraid to say I got needs, but the only time you here for me
Is when the bottles popping and everything is sweet

For you, I gave my heart and turned my back against the world

Ever since she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it...
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
Bad ass, señoritas, two-seaters with kicks
New kicks, all in the mix
I don't turn no tricks, they turn for me
Catching bricks don't concern me
So forget it, little midget
My mind on seven digits
Before I pay Heaven skies a visit, now dig it
I'm pulling all stops, locking down all spots
Saying "You, can't, front"
So, from this day forth, you know I'm all about heat
And what I do be the Major League
That's why your girlfriend's paging me
And she know like he know
You don't see her like I see her, so she's out the door
Shotgun in my drop, having fun
With the Don, system bassing, conversation
About how she been chasing me
And facing me, saying, "Give it to me now, baby"
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
Don't check me
It was your girl who let me
Take it this far, then, ooh wee!
Let her have it every chance that she could get

You can get mad if you want to, say whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it...
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way

Girl, what you doing to me

And you hate to admit it
But you still take me back
All that shit you was talking

You always say that I'll never change 
I ain't always wrong, I take the blame 
Man up and say, I own my mistakes
Girl, I need you now
Ah baby, I need you, ah baby, I need you
Help me out

You know who it is when you see me calling, huh
Yeah, I know I was wrong, but you knew better
Give you up, I would never
You always say I'm stuck in my ways 
You always say that I'll never change 
I ain't always wrong, I take the blame 
Yet I, man up and say, I own my mistakes
Girl, I need you now
Ah baby, I need you, oh hold me down

What I been through, you can't imagine
Turn up the juice, walk through the water
Bright berry booze, yeah
Soon as you seen me, started recording
Got something to prove
Saving my texts, screenshots
Breaking the rules
You can't be jealous
A whole lot of bitches that hang with the crew
Oh-oh-oh
Only if you knew, then you know, and you know
Money fast, money fast, never slow
No need to boast, having a toast, doing the most
Wanna ride in the Ghost? 
Wanna feel like you're floatin'? 
Phantom look like a boat 
Five karats my rope 
Look like I sell dope 
Put some fur on my coat 
And them diamonds the choke 
Like I'm playing with that coke 
I was playing with they hoes
Some friends some foes
Hunnid M's my bank account
Had to set some new goals
I was dripping the water out
That would leave a bitch cold 
Had to call up the fire department
I was burning up dope 
I was getting my money right
Then I went Pluto 
And it could've been perfect timing
I was already on 
Tell me you haven’t been lying
'Cause I don't condone it 
You got a rock, started to keep your ass at home 
Tell you been driving me crazy, tell you been driving me crazy
Who you been texting daily, who you been texting daily
You know I don't do fugazi, you know I don't do fugazi
Hope you ain't lettin' him hit it, hope you ain't lettin' him hit it
I hope you staying ambitious, I hope you being committed
Perpetrating them feelings, but that ain't the way you get it
I was dripping the water out
That would leave a bitch cold
Had to call up the fire department
I was burning up dope
I was getting my money right
Then I went Pluto
Couldn't have been more perfect timing
I was already on
Tell me you haven't been lying
'Cause I don't condone
You got a rock, starting to keep your ass at home
Oh, oh
Keep your ass at home
Need to stay at home
Stay at home, yeah

So captivating when I get it on the floor
Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure with seconds left, I show up
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
Get up both your hands, I'm in the zone, s'aite
Put em in the air, if you more, and more
'Cause I can't wait to feel it
I go hard, can't stop
But if I stop, just know that I'ma bring it back
Never quitting, don't believe in that
Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner

No one was brave enough to cross except for me, here I am, yeah
She built a castle from the piece she took from me
I'm going crazy, think she brought out the worst in me
Here I am, yeah
Guess the price was the fall if I get up
'Cause the strong will survive, that don't give up
Where she fell in love, her heart is resting now
Six feet underground
Oh, she feels stupid loving me for me, yeah
And I'm the fool who falls too easily
We all fall down sometimes, we all fall down sometimes
So why can't I? Hey, oh, so why can't I?
You gotta go I know the time waits for no man
Don't say your words unspoken, girl, I overstand, here I am
What do we mean? Some questions don't have an answer
Two out of three made me a believer, here I am, yeah
Guess the price was the fall if I get up
'Cause the strong will survive, that don't give up
Where she fell in love, her heart is resting now
Six feet underground
Oh, she feels stupid loving me for me, yeah
And I'm the fool who falls too easily
We all fall down sometimes, girl, we all fall down sometimes
So why can't I? Hey, so why can't I?
Oh, she feels stupid loving me for me, oh yeah

We all fall down sometimes, we all fall down sometimes
So why can't I? Hey, oh so why can't I?What's so complicated?

Man, quit playing with me, man
No, for real, don't play like that
Are you, are you serious?
How you know?
Put that on everything
Damn...
I'ma call you back
I'ma call you back
Every time I was in L.A., I was with my ex-girlfriend
Every time you called, I told you, "Baby, I'm working"
 I was out doing my dirt
 Wasn't thinking about you getting hurt
 was hand-in-hand in the Beverly Center like, man
Not giving a damn who sees me
So gone 
So wrong 
Acting like I didn't have you sitting at home
Thinking about me
Being a good girl that you are
I bet you probably believe you got a good man
A man that never would do the things I'm about to tell you I've done
Brace yourself, it ain't good
But it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else
I know you hate me
I know I hurt you
But there's more
Listen...Yeah, been a minute
But I still feel the same
Yeah, yeah
You know I want you
Give me another chance to be your man, be your man, no
I promise I won't let you hurt again, hurt again, no
Don't be afraid, baby, take my hand, take my hand, no
Give me another chance, give me another chance, oh
Just give me another chance, give me another chance, oh
Girl I can't lie, things are just not the same without you
The sun just don't shine no more
All it does is, all it does is just rain without you
Girl I ain't too proud to beg, your love is that good
I miss the thrill, baby, girl if I could...
Show you how I matured, I'm ready to settle
Ready to take this love to another level
What's up with you and I, you and I, babe?
Let me back in your life, second try, babe
Between them thighs, spread
Girl you decide, girl you decide-cide, babe
Girl you decide, girl you decide, oh
Give me another chance to be your man, be your man, no
I promise I won't let you hurt again, hurt again, no
Promise I'll never hurt you again

What's up with you and I, you and I, babe? 
Let me back in your life, second try, babe
Between them thighs, spread

Said I'll promise to be better or whatever it takes 
Oh, yeah
Girl just let me back in your life
Give me another chance to be your man, be your man, no
Give me another chance, I'll promise to be better, baby
I'll promise I won't let you hurt again, hurt again
I promise I won't let you hurt again, oh no
Don't be afraid baby, take my hand, take my hand
Don't be afraid to take my hand
Give me another chance, give me another chance, oh
Just give me another chance, give me another chance, ohIf love was a bird, then we wouldn't have wings
If love was a sky, we'd be blue
If love was a choir, you and I could never sing
'Cause love isn't for me and you
If love was an Oscar, you and I could never win
'Cause we can never act out our parts
If love is the Bible, then we are lost in sin
Because it's not in our hearts
So why don't you go your way and I'll go mine
Live your life and I'll live mine
Baby, you'll do well and I'll be fine
'Cause we're better off separated
If love was a fire, then we have lost the spark
Love never felt so cold
If love was a light, then we're lost in the dark
Left with no one to hold
If love was a sport, we're not on the same team
You and I are destined to lose
If love was an ocean, then we are just a stream
'Cause love isn't for me and you
So why don't you go your way and I'll go mine
Live your life and I'll live mine
Baby, you'll do well and I'll be fine
'Cause we're better off separated
Girl, I know we had some good times
It's sad, but now we gotta say goodbye
Girl, you know I love you, I can't deny
I can't say we didn't try to make it work for you and I
I know it hurts so much, but it's best for us
Somewhere along this windy road, we lost the trust
So I'll walk away so you don't have to see me cry
It's killing me so, why don't you go?
So why don't you go your way and I'll go mine
Live your life and I'll live mine
Baby, you'll do well, and I'll be fine
'Cause we're better off, so much better off
Go your way and I'll go mine
Live your life and I'll live mine
You'll do well and I'll be fine
'Cause we're better off, so much better off...
So much better off
Separated
I'm sorry we didn't make itI mean...
Ush, is this what it comes to man?
This how we gon' do it?
I mean, even grass grow, baby, you know?
Seeds become plants, boys become men
What we gon' do? Let's lead the way
Uh, wrapped around all girls like Pashminas
What's my demeanor? The grass is always greener
On the other side, there's bigger lies, can't give a ring up
I couldn't give a fuck, how could I give a finger?
Let alone half bath and closets
So claustrophobic, in fear of close objects
Now it's sort of like two-car garages
It's like two broads menagin', you're the best, mama
Is there any chance that you remember me being more than just a horrible man?
And would you consider pulling this trigger and taking a second shot at romance? Aw baby
I groomed the days when you were my girl
And I was your man, though I took you for granted
But it wasn't 'til now I see...
How much I missed you
Girl, I'm sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once, here goes the truth
I can't be fake, I can't be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homies that's lonely
I try to flex, but I confess
That when you left, you took the very best thing
The best thing that ever happened to me
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress
'Cause, baby, when you left, you took the very best
Remember Mimi or Vita? Remember Iesha or Eva? 
Hey, it's for Naomi and Jenny, was the same outcome as Chilli
Oooh, no more tricking and kissing miscellaneous chicks acting like a jerk
Woman, I been to church and I talked to the bishop
And he wanted me to share this with you
How much I missed you
I'm so sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once, here goes the truth
I can't be fake, I can't be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homies that's lonely
I try to flex, but I confess
That when you left, you took the very best thing
The best thing that ever happened to me
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress
'Cause, baby, when you left, you took the very best
Momma try to told me, "Hovi Hov to slow it down
You gon' lose your best thing if you keep getting 'round"
Like Pop need a partner when you old to hold you down
Ma, forever young, was forever numb
Sorry Stacy, sorry Dawn, Amil-lion and all of them
All of them was for their time, it wasn't you, it was him
School me once, school me twice, three times, I was dumb
Now it's so plain to see to me I got the one
You're the best, mama
I can't be fake, I can't be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homies that's lonely
I try to flex, but I confess
That when you left, you took the very best thing
The best thing that ever happened to me
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress
'Cause, baby, when you left, you took the very bestBeen through hell, now I'm hell proof
Pouring cups of whiskey to get through it
Oh sweet child of mine, gone way too soon
Lost myself and lost my faith too
I've had my share of ups and downs
I've had my share of down and outs
Baptized in a river and almost drowned
That's when I figured out
I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now
I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now
Stronger than ever now
Ohh
Walk through fire now I'm fireproof
Forever wear these scars like tattoos
Finally found paradise right in my view
And its killing me that I can't share it with you
I've had my share of ups and downs
I've had my share of down and outs
Baptized in a river and almost drowned
That's when I figured out
I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now
I'm stronger than ever now, I'm stronger than ever now
Though you're gone you still live in my mind
The only thing we ran out of is time
Since you left I ain't been quite the same
I wonder if you miss me, do I make you proud
Know you're watching me, I feel your spirit
I keep you right by my side
I'm stronger than ever now, far from perfect
Life will knock you down, get back up
Fight for whats worth it
Be strong enough, I know its easier said than done
Stronger than ever now
I been through it, now stronger
Stronger now, hey stronger now
All that I been through some how I found my way out
Long as I believe in me, I know I can make it
I know you'll make it, cause you're stronger
Stronger than ever now
StrongerRight, oh y'all know what I'm sayin'
Trackmasters, what up?
Yo, you remind me of this chick I knew, used to pursue
She wouldn't let the Meth' Man screw, but let the crew
So I did what any man in that situation would do
Go find him something new that's gon' keep it gangsta, too
Don't take it personal, I just call it the way I see
And what I see is not a potential wife to be
So basically, there it is and there it go
I'll pass this time, but next lifetime who knows?
Anything I suppose
See, the thing about you, that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl I'm-a try
You need to sit down, this may take a while....
See, this girl she sorta looks like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you
 
You remind me of a girl that I once knew 
See her face whenever I, I look at you
Wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
 This is why I just can't get with you
I can recall a certain magic in your eyes
Although we are just meeting, I feel as though I already know you
It's such a shame that you remind me of a past love, my worst love
So sorry, but I can't get with you cause remind me, yeah
You remind me of a guy that I once knew 
See his face whenever I, I look at you
Wouldn't believe all of things she put me through 
This is why I just can't get with you
 {Method Man}
I know it's so unfair to you 
It's so unfair
That I relay her ignorance to you 
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me.... 
{Yes, yes y'all, don't stop y'all
To the beat y'all, Trackmasters and ya don't stop}
It's just somethin' about ya
That got me not knowin' if I wanna kiss ya or slap the shit out ya
My bad, I'm losin' myself, don't get me wrong
It's just that oil and water don't get along
Take it from somebody that know, been there befo'
I used to where my heart on my sleeve, not anymo'
Ask Usher and Blu, nothin' hurt me more than your love do
I put that on my life and The 'W'
You remind me
 {Blu Cantrell}

They say money can't buy you love
They say money can't buy you love
They never seem to listen
I'm all ears
Just copped your girl a brand new Rolex
But you can never find the time to spend at home
Thinking that's gon' keep her happy
When time is all she wanted all along
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it
So you think that you know what's important
Steady chasing your fame and your fortune
But you don't know you're chasing a dime, losing a treasure
Those dollars don't make sense to me at all
Ooh, it goes 
You give her spending money 
But all she wanna spend is time alone 
Keep giving her 
But she don't really need that 
You're gonna end up alone 
In a world without love 
Why would you do it?
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it
Listen, stop trying to buy her love
'Cause you won't ever have enough
There's always someone with more than you
You need to pay her attention
Give her what she needs
Do the simple things
Before you lose your girl to me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeeah
Yeeeah, yeah

Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it
You better look out

But what are you saying?
Oh hoo oh hooo
Don't be a fool, you got a good thing
Man, are you blind, stupid or crazy?
You got a good thing, uh

If that's your lady, you better hold on
And give her what she want before she move on
Man, I tell you, cars, clothes, and fancy things don't mean a damn thing
If you ain't kicking it, baby
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

But I know that I wanna do it again, yeah
I don't know if I'll win 
But I know that I wanna do it again, yeah
I don't know if I'll ever win 
Mars vs. VenusYeah, um...
See, it's situations like this
That cause us playas to get caught up 
In, um, the truth, yeah, yeah 
What you been doing, where you been?
I paged you and you ain’t hit me back 
And I've been calling and I know you see my number on that caller I.D 
Just listen to the words
The way you feel, the past you lived
The things you did
It don’t matter to me
For what it’s worth, just don’t lie to me
'Cause that ain’t what I need right now
Baby, everything we built on trust
You're tearing it down
'Cause I know the truth hurts 
Tell me the truth now
What you been doing and who you been doing it with 
Where you been going and how you been putting your thing down 
Whatever you was working, I hope that it was worth it, baby 
I got reason to believe that you been fooling around
Girl, I'm really trying hard to understand
I want to move on and put it in the past
'Cause you claim that you ain’t doing nothing
Must be my insecurities
It’s got the best of me right now, uh
What I know, I can't hold it inside of me
It’s gon' drive me insane
That's how I know the truth hurts, yeah
Tell me the truth now
What you been doing and who you been doing it with 
Where you been going and how you been putting your thing down 
Whatever you was working, I hope that it was worth it, baby 
I got reason to believe that you been fooling around
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

Bah, bah, bah, bah 
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah 
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah 
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah 
Truth hurts
Now wait a minute
Oh, listen babe 
The truth is, I've got the secret
I've been keeping from you, baby
'Cause I know that you gonna tear up the place
Punch me in my face
Pull the hot grits out, I think you need to sit down, oh
I've been blaming you when I'm the one that's doing wrong
I'm gonna go on
My guilty conscience is the real reason I wrote this song
Girl, I know the truth hurts, baby
Tell me the truth now
What you been doing and who you been doing it with 
Where you been going and how you been putting your thing down 
Whatever you was working, I hope that it was worth it, baby 
I got reason to believe that you been fooling around
Tell me the truth now
What you been doing and who you been doing it with 
Where you been going and how you been putting your thing down 
Whatever you was working, I hope that it was worth it, baby 
I got reason to believe that you been fooling around
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah 
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bahWhat you doin'? What you doin' to me?
You know that you got me
You got me where you want me
You know what you doin'
Nah-nah, I don't want you to stop
Come here
Go!
Never been a people person, always been a people's person
Know how to get a person, don't know how to keep a person, yeah
But you know everybody need somebody
And everybody ain't gon' be somebody
I mean, it's been like twenty years since my mother has seen somebody
I'm convinced that she thinks that's it's too late or somethin'
I should try and set her up on a date or somethin'
You deserve love, how long are you gon' wait for somethin'?
Nah, we gon find you someone doin' some
Someone rich and single, is Lionel Richie single?
Haha, okay, I'm jokin', I'm kiddin', I'm playin'
At least tell me that you hear all this shit that I'm sayin'
I don't wanna be the only man you laugh with
Life is quick, you should start it happy and end it happy
She ask me "Are you and... happy?"
I never told you what ended up happenin'
As I pretend you haven't made a mess
Of this young man, it's crazy how I degress
And now you got the best of me 
Don't worry 'bout the rest of me 
And now you got the best of me 
Don't worry 'bout the rest of me
Oh, the world is far from perfect
'Cause I only think of you
But I feel like it is worth it
Everything's movin' in slow motion
Movin' in slow motion
You smile at me, I act like I'm not impressed
You ain't too please, in a place that I can't protest
And now you got the best of me 
Don't worry 'bout the rest of me 
And now you got the best of me 
Don't worry 'bout the rest of me 
Inside is bliss, but outside my world's a wreck
'Cause every time that you pass me
I can't help but turn my neck
And now you got the best of me 
Don't worry 'bout the rest of me 
And now you got the best of me 
Don't worry 'bout the rest of me 
Oh, the world is far from perfect
'Cause I only think of you 
But I feel like it is worth it
Everything's movin' in slow motion
It's movin' in slow motion 
I feel so undeservin'  of the mere presence of you 
And my vision, it gets blurry 
Everything's movin' in slow motion 
Movin' in slow motion 
I started believin' that crazy shit she told me
Not sure if that makes me crazy or just lonely
Then I got bored, because fightin' is boring
And she was gone soon as I started stallin'
I don't want it except for when I want it
And even then I beat myself up for it
That's when you hear me say I'm movin' on from it
But it's obviously something else that I want from it
And then that's how she goes about it
It's hard to act like you want it when you know you got it
I'm textin' and callin' like that's my true callin'
And the only time that she's really talking
Is when you she tells me about myself like that's what's important
Startin' things over nothin', that shit is overwhelmin'
Her main problem is she always think I'm up to somethin'
And, shit, talking 'bout it make me wanna fuckin' call her
Reverse psychology, whatever you call it
But to answer the question, yeah, I think we're happy
We're always reunited, that's a good thing, I guess
We're always startin' over, that shit always seems excitin'
I don't know, I guess it's yet to be seen
She's busy doin' her and I'm out here chasin' the dream
Honestly, we say a lot of things that we don't mean
Start happy, end happy, with the summer in between, slow motion
Oh, the world is far from perfect
'Cause I only think of you 
But I feel like it is worth it
Everything movin' in slow motion
It's movin' in slow motion That night I said I was recording late
I wasn't recording late
I was just smoking, chilling, had a couple drinks
Not much of anything
And that time I flew down to the MIA
Then I went MIA
I hit up KOD with a few bands to play 
And that ain't everything
All I think about is bitches, umm
And everywhere I go they come
Double standards let everybody talk 'bout it 
The tables turned around, I be throwing up six
So I ain't trying to justify
All I do
So tired of lying
All I do
All I doI'm hoping that this ain't too hard to believe
'Cause baby, you're the only one for me
I know it get hard when I'm moving in and out of state
But I promise my heart for you, I would save
Just remember that...
No matter how far I go
And no matter how long it takes
No one or nothing can change
Forever yours, here I stand
Here I stand, baby
You're like a mirror to my soul, but a queen, my queen
And finally now I know just what that means, oh yeah
You're the blessing I never thought I would get
And to the Lord, I humbly bow my head
Just remember that no matter how far I go
And no matter how long it takes
No one or nothing can change
Forever yours, here I stand
Ever since you came 
It seems like 
Yeah, I felt I sunk so low
That there's was no way I could be found 
And when we make love 
Give, you make me feel a way I never felt with no one else
And I can't help myself
I'm telling you that no matter how far I go
And no matter how long it takes
No one or nothing, nothing, baby
Never change the way I feel, I'm your man
Listen, see, forever yours
Yours, all yours, here I stand, yeah
No matter how far I go
And no matter how long it takes
No one or nothing can change
Forever yours, I'll remain, here I standI've got two-dozen roses
And a card that says, "Baby, I can't wait to see you later"
We made dinner reservations
At Nobu, Mr. Chow's, you just pick the location
Now we're sitting at the table, sipping the finest wine
Having a damn good time, I know what's on your mind
I want you, you want me too
Stop fronting, I know exactly what you want, you wanna...
Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body, baby, body, baby
Do it to me, I guarantee you won't regret it
Let me set it out like you ain't never had it
Do it to me, I want you to grab me, talk to me
Tell me how you like it, when you want it, when you all up on it
Do it to me, I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna make this a night to remember
Watching you work the stick in the ride
The motion how you move from 3rd to 5
Can't imagine what it’s gon' be once we get inside
And you put that ooh wee on me and you work me the same way
Ooh, I can't wait
(I'm tired of thinking about it, speaking about it
Baby, it's time to be about it
Turn off the lights, tear off your clothes
Jump in the bed and let it flow)
Squeezing, holding, biting, scratching, spanking, screaming
Pulling my hair when you need me
Everything goes, baby, when you...
Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body, baby, body, baby
Do it to me, I guarantee you won't regret it
Let me set it out like you ain't never had it
Do it to me, I want you to grab me, talk to me
Tell me how you like it, when you want it, when you all up on it
Do it to me, I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna make this a night to remember
So long I've waited for this night to get inside you
Look in your eyes and tell you, "Baby, take me, I'm yours"
And if you feel anything like I feel
By the end of the night, I'm certain you'll be screaming for more
I wanna do anything and everything to your body
'Til you break down, can't take no more
From the bed to the floor, to the top of the stairs
You gon' get it, baby
Please, please, oh… do it to me
Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body, baby, body, baby
Do it to me, I guarantee you won't regret it
Let me set it out like you ain't never had it
Do it to me, I want you to grab me, talk to me
Tell me how you like it, when you want it, when you all up on it
Do it to me, I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna make this a night to rememberHe said, "You swear to tell the truth
The whole truth, and nothing but the truth?"
I said, "Yeah, man
Right hand high, never tell a lie"
Y-Y-Your Honor, I didn't know that I hurt her
I didn't know she was crying
I didn't know that it was killing me slow
And-And your honor, she can't say I ain't love her
Can't say I ain't try
But I guess my love wasn't good enough
I guess I'm guilty for wanting to be up in the club
I guess I'm guilty 'cause girls always wanna show me love
I guess I'm guilty for living and having a little fun
Well, I'm guilty, for that, girl, I'm guilty
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail
Don't take me to jail
(I ain't did nothing to her, gave everything to her
For that)
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail 
Don't take me to jail
Your Honor, she accused me of cheating
It was all in her thinking
She gon' believe what she want to
So what the hell am I gon' do?
Turn my life around, it ain't going down
She knew 'bout the life that I live, why she crying now?
This shit is so silly to me, but I won't plead that
I guess I'm guilty for wanting to be up in the club
I guess I'm guilty 'cause girls always wanna show me love
I guess I'm guilty for living and having a little fun
Well, I'm guilty, for that, girl, I'm guilty
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail 
Don't take me to jail
(How we supposed to get along with her going through my phone?
In her mind, she decided I did it)
Don't take me to jail 
Don't take me to jail 
Don't take me to jail
(Don't wanna cop a plea, I swear it wasn't me
It don't matter 'cause to her, I'm guilty)
Let's go, right hand to the sky, strike me down if I lie
If she saying she the victim in this case, well, what am I?
If I hurt her, I ain't try to, the club I may decide to
Ride through, she got proof? Well, I got alibis too
A couple million dollar worth of bags and full of shoes
Seven-carat solitaire, Caribbean, water blue
Range Rover, Porsche Panamera, and the Bentley Coupe
All the shit I did for her and this who you gon' listen to?
And her life, I submit to you as evidence, I never been on bullshit
She ain't caught me on no Tiger Woods shit
Knew what I expected when she met me, should have left me then
Balling against the law? Shorty, go on and arrest me then
I guess I'm guilty for wanting to be up in the club
I guess I'm guilty 'cause girls always wanna show me love
I guess I'm guilty for living and having a little fun
Well, I'm guilty, for that, girl, I'm guilty
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail 
Don't take me to jail
(If you gon' treat me like a crook, putting money on my books
Never mind, forget it)
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail 
Don't take me to jail
(Tired of your little games, fuck it, I'll take the blame
I did it, guilty)I was all alone
I was feeling rather low
I needed someone to lift my spirits up
So I dropped in on a dance
Just to take a glance
And there this lovely thing was
She was more than enough
I asked her for her hand
Said, "would you like to dance?"
So pleased that I had asked
She quickly took my hand
And we danced and fell in love
On a slow jam, oohh
Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby, for me
Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby and for me
Seems what you say is true
I feel the same way, too
You see, I waited all night long
Just to dance with you
And when you touched my hand
I knew you were the man
To turn my world around
And make my dreams come true
The magic in your eyes
Made me realize
That everything I feel
Has got to be real
And we danced and fell in love
On a slow jam
Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam
For me and for my baby
Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby and for me
I'm trying to find someone who
I can give my good loving to
Never, ever did I dream I'd find someone, yeah
Now, I've been trying to find someone, too
I prayed to Heaven and then I found you
I swear, I fell in love the night you danced into my heart
Play another slow jam 
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam
Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
(Can I get a slow jam, play another slow jam
Are you gonna slow jam?)
Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam
Play another slow jam
This time, make it sweet
On a slow jam....Peace up, A Town down, Philly, yeah, yeah, okay, okay
Usher, Usher, wait, Lil Jon, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Luda, Usher, Lil Jon and Free
When its time, only niggers' rock designer first
And we pull up and we crush the curb
And the rims so deep, you can't find your feet
Can't see past the truck, past the Phantom, the click
I catch Hummer, Benz, and Bentley's
Wrist froze, step on the grease, crush the guard
And, with Jay-Z twisting up weed, the Big Bad Wolf
He'll puff your hut down, the gauge, I'll buck rounds
Leave you with no knees, the O.G., probably bouncing to rap music
The four life fluid and it does make the chicks' scream
Take that and rewind it back
Lil Jon's got the beat that make's your booty go smack
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go
I was up in the club with my homies'
Trying to get a little V I
Keep it down on the low key, low key
You should know how it feels, hey, hey
I saw the shorty, she was checking up on me
From the game, she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she know me, know me
I decided to chill, okay, conversation got heavy
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow, watch out
Oh, watch out, she's saying, 'Come get me', 'Come get me'
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, 'Baby, let's go', when I told her, 'Let's go', I said
Yeah, yeah, shorty got down on her knees, said 'Come and get me'
Yeah, yeah, I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
Yeah, yeah, her and my girl used to be the best of homies'
Yeah, yeah, next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming
 + 
Yeah  yeah  yeah - yeah!
Yeah  yeah  yeah - yeah!
 + 
She's all up in my head now
Got me thinking that it might
Be a good time to take her with me 
Cause she's ready to leave  
Now I got to keep it real now
Cause on a 1 to 10 she's a certified 20
But that just ain't me 
Cause I don't know, if I take that chance
Just where's it going to lead?
But what I do know, is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me
The way she "get low!"
I'm like yeah, just work that out for me
She ask for one more dance and I'm like yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave?
 and I said..
 + 
 + 
 + 
Watch out, my outfit's rediculous
In the club looking so conspicuous
And RAWR, these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow 
And forget about game, I'm a spit the truth 
I won't stop until I get them in they birthday suits 
So give me the rhythm and it'll be of with they clothes
Then bend over to the FRONT - and touch your toes!
I - left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting then I put them on foot patrol  
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thou-sand!
Let's drink, you the one to please 
Ludacris fill cups like double D's 
Me and Ush once more and we leaves them dead
We want a lady in the streets but a freak in the bed - that say..

 + 
Take that and rewind it back
Lil' Jon got the beat that make your booty go 
Take that, rewind it back
Usher's got the voice that make your booty go 
Take that, rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow that make your booty go 
Take that, rewind it back
Lil' Jon got the beat that make your booty go Listen, I'd be a liar if I told you that I didn't see it coming
Be more of a liar if I said, "Hey, I didn't want it to be something"
You deserve much better for the love that you have shared
I know you won't believe it, but girl, I swear
That I got love for you, big love for you
Even when I'm tripping
The fact remains that you will always be my baby
My baby
But dig the truth, baby, dig the truth
I can't hide my feelings
Especially when the whole world can see
That my heart is in two different places
I got you in my life and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces
And I can't break ties 'cause they both look right
Someone tell me, what's a man to do when he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie, but he can't tell the truth?
What's a man to do when he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart in two different places?
I know you feel it 'cause you stayed
There is much more to this story
But I'd be a fool to say I trust her and I'm always gonna love her
You know that you don't wanna hear
How I'm living on the edge, baby
So I just say, "Yeah, baby"
She ain't nothing, but she is real
But why I take her through it
When I still got love for you, big love for you
Even when I'm tripping
The fact remains that you will always be my baby
My baby
But dig the truth, baby, dig the truth
I can't hide my feelings
Especially when the whole world can see
That my heart is in two different places
I got you in my life and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces
And I can't break ties 'cause they both look right
Someone tell me, what's a man to do when he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie, but he can't tell the truth?
What's a man to do when he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart in two different places?
I wanna tell you it's over, that I ain't thinking of her
I wanna really mean it, that I want you to see it
That I'm really trying to leave her behind
And I'm trying not to make you cry
I wanna tell you that I ain't playing games
And I'm dedicated to receive a change
But when I look in the mirror, it's the same old man
That my heart is in two different places 
I got you in my life  and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces 
And I can't break ties 'cause they both look right
Someone tell me, what's a man to do when he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie, but he can't tell the truth?
What's a man to do when he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart in two different places?
Not in two different placesI walk up in that motherfucker like, get what you want

You're such a sight to see in the month of June
Beautiful like the moon's reflection when
It's passing off your skin
And before you let me in
I hear you say, "It's been a long time"
I say, "Okay-kay-kay, don't worry, I got you"
Do you say, "How 'bout some foreplay?"
Got that, got plenty, I got you
Do you say, "Play some slow ones"
Got that Sade, Al Green, and Marvin Gaye, too

Since you've been in my life, when I'm away from you, I hurry home 
You live in my mind, so I never feel like I'm alone, yeah

And when it gets too fast  and I feel like slowing down 
No one understands but you
That's why I only see myself with you
Ooooh, I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Pull up, pull up, pull up, I'ma pull upDo I remind you of the pain
That he put you through, girl?
Is that the reason I'm to blame
Before I do it?
Is it because he treated you badly
I always stand accused?
Protecting yourself from somebody else
I'm not who's hurting you, girl
And it's killing me, girl, knowing
You compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, no, I can't win
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay
Paying for his mistakes
He left a scar across your heart
I understand, girl
Don't let his wrongs tear us apart
'Cause girl, I'm your man
Just because he did, you swear I'm cheating
You think I just don't care
Why must I do time for another man's crime?
Girl, you know that ain't fair
And it's killing me, girl, knowing
You compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, no, I can't win
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay
Paying for his mistakes
I know he did you wrong
But tell me, what does that have to do with me?
Trying to show you something real
Figure out what is going on
Before you look up and I'll be gone
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do, girl
I love you, and I love you, I love you
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do, girl
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay

When she smiled at me, she took my breath away
She's reminiscent of a goddess
It's a shame that we could not communicate
How do I say...
How do I say hello? I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
My baby, how do I say, how do I say?
How do I say?
The room was filled with a sweet aroma
When she danced, her hips moved oh so sensuous
She speaks with her body, so hypnotic
In the language that I never will forget
I hear her calling
Spinning around in the crowd till she found me
Then she started moving closer and closer
Does she know that I want her, I want her?
I wanna be with her tonight
So I caressed her face, kissed her lips
All my life, I've never felt quite like this
I've never had a loss for words
One kiss from her has got me speechless
How do I say hello? I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
Mujer bonita, how do I say, how do I say?

In the body language we speak, won't need any translation
An odyssey of physical pleasure
As we explore
Together, this universal language of our love

How do I say, how do I say?
How do I say?
How do I say?
How do I say?I know I vowed to never do this again, but, uh
I guess this seems to be the only thing I'm good at
Got something that you need to know
Be the realest shit I never wrote
Can't hold it, gotta let it go
Know that I mean every note
Yeah, yeah, listen baby
Let me start by saying that the way I feel for you has never once changed
And the games I played, mistakes I made leave me sorrier than you'll ever know
We got a problem, baby, I can't lie
'Cause lately, I realize that I
Never knew that we was on the same 
Knew that it was wrong, but we 
And I know you never knew when you said I do
That you would have to face all the 
And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this
Trade memories for moments, trade love to be lonely
Guess that's just the man in me, blame it on celebrity
When the night time feel like the right time
And that spotlight feel like the right light
When it's really just my fears and I still don't dry your tears
When I say, "She ain't you and I really love you more"
And you say, "If it's true, why you do it for?"
And I, I really don't have no excuse
I break your heart, make you cry, I just wanna say goodbye
And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this
What I feel, I don't even gotta write it
It's like poison in my body and there's no way to deny
That my heart is a time bomb with seconds left to explode
But I gotta let you know before it blows
That it ain't on you, it's my fault
All the gossip and talk, behind your back when you walk
By the time you will know, before long you will see
That you deserve more, you deserve more
You deserve so much more than what I'm offering
And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this
Live with this
Can you live with this, girl?
I just want you know
Got something that you need to know
This be the realest shit I never wrote, uh
Can't hold it, gotta let it go
Know that I mean every note, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, umm ummUsher, Usher
Yeah, man
True story
Real G's with me on this one
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Wifey home, wedding band, I'm a lucky man
You'd think I'd be satisfied and truthfully, yes I am
But lately, only late at night, I find it hard to sleep
Stay struggling with the part of me that wants to run the streets
My Mac is in my backpack, I'm surfing on the sites
I'm chatting, this ain't cheating, just telling myself a lie 
And it's almost like I'm caught up and living another life
Man, I'm hungry for something, I need to feed this appetite
Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best, put my BS under arrest
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies
Could've picked up the phone, could've ended up doing wrong
Man, I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies
I'm not trying to be late, rush through security gates
With weather in Atlanta, all outgoing flights delayed
No rooms left in the Mandarin, I gotta figure out a play
Sparked up some conversation, she was going the same way
We started talking business, she handed me a card
We exchanged information, I rented me a car
While I'm driving, she calling, I'm thinking this is how it starts
Fine as hell, but I don't wanna break my baby's heart, no, no
Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best, put my BS under arrest
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies
Could've picked up the phone, could've ended up doing wrong
Man, I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies
They call me U-S, H-E-R, R-A, Y-M, O-N-D
And I just wanna do right by my lady
But lately, I been slipping up
Fantasies 'bout dimes on the side, dark tint on my ride
I got a 10 in my ride, I can hide, I can't lie, lie
But ever since I put that band on my hand
More and more chicks trying to get at me than I know what to do
Just trying to handle my grown man B.I
Got a girl I don't want to lose, I don't want to lose
Break her heart, I do want to do
I don't want to be that fool, make that move
Bend them a bit, but never break the rules
Bend a bit but never break the rules
Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best, put my BS under arrest
'Cause I love my lady

You changed my life in so many ways  
I just think back to  
How I used to be and how you dealt with me 
Just want to thank you
Just in case I never see your face again
Just in case the worst was meant to happen
Just in case tomorrow never come, there is something you should know 
I've given you every bit of the man I am 
I know at times, it wasn't pretty, but it was all I had
I never held back, not one little bit, and the world can attest to this
And baby, you flipped my program upside down 
I was a hustler and player, girl 
I'd drink a little something, then hit a little something 
But how you made a , look what I've been 
You got my life  and I thank you 
I really used to throw a lot 
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all of that done changed, my game, my frame of mind, you got it right
And I love you for life, girl, I love you for life
There was so many times I wasn't there for you
And for everyone of those times, I hated myself for
The way I went about it, the ups and the downs
One foot in, while the other foot's out
Loving on you, loving on another
But I ain't no different from any other brother
So what I give to you right here, right now
In this here place 
In this here space 
As I state my case, as I break it down
To tell you where I'm coming from so you've seen the good you've done
So you've feel the change you've made, stay with me every day
I was a hustler and player, girl 
I'd drink a little something, then hit a little something 
But how you made a , look what I've been 
You got my life  and I thank you 
I really used to throw a lot 
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all of that done changed, my game, my frame of mind, you got it right
And I love you for life, girl, I love you for life
Girl, if I died tonight before I wake
Know that you touched my life in oh so many ways
And sugar, if this song is I had to give, would you remember?
Remember my heart, remember it was good
Remember that I tried as long as I could
Remember that I gave 'til I had nothing else
Remember my voice
I was a hustler and player, girl 
I'd drink a little something, then hit a little something 
But how you made a , look what I've been 
You got my life  and I thank you

Usher! Usher! Usher!Hello everybody
Welcome, today, to the wonderful world of you
Now, check it, you have two options:
You can eat it
Or throw it away
See, it's a shame that when you're working hard and doing well People hate you
Buying nothing else but the best for yourself
They really hate you
You gotta live for you and no one else
Don't let them make you feel
Like you're not being real
Just live how you wanna live
You gotta do for you
If you work hard, play hard 
And do what you wanna do 
Just pop your collar, don't let what people say bother you 
You perpetrators, I got something to say 
You can eat it or throw it away 
You're just mad 'cause you're following in my trap
But can you dig that?
Hey, ladies 
Hey, fellas 
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies 
Hey, fellas 
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
You can see me every week
Hanging out with a different girl sitting next to me
'Cause I'm not about to settle down right now
I gotta be free
Some of y'all fellas might be jealous
But y'all know that don't phase me
I just pop my collar, tip my hat
And turn my back on the ones that hated me
Never going home alone 
If she follows, then you know it's on 
She use the pager, not the cellular phone 
I let her know I won't be around for long 
To all you haters, I got something to say 
You can eat it or throw it away 
Stop hating, wishing, waiting
Anticipating for my heat to fade
Hey, ladies 
Hey, fellas 
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies 
Hey, fellas 
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
I break my neck for the things I get
So much sweat, just so I can get that check
And I'm not gonna let nobody bring me down
Nobody's gonna steal the crown
Because I eat good, I live good
I rock good, my life good
If you got a lot and you're working for it
Pop your collar, don't be afraid to show it
Hey, ladies 
Hey, fellas 
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous

But it's like you don't hear me
What more could I do?
Girl, you can keep that
Trying to make me jealous
I admit that I've been careless
But we can't take back what's done
I know why you did that
You're frustrated 'cause I don't react
Maybe you want some feedback
'Cause normally my feelings don't show
But baby...
I care for you
By now you should now that I care for you
You say my actions never show it
I don't wear my heart on my sleeve
But what you get's what you see

Baby, I care for you
I, I, I, I care
I, I, I, I care for you
Every day, I'm
Trying to prove myself to you
But what's the point?
No such thing is satisfying you
Maybe you'll appreciate it later By the time I'm gone
Better get your act together, don't wait too long
Don't wanna change what we have to what we had
Girl, I need you to know that I...

Anytime I could just lose control, caught up
In your loving, everytime I feel your touch
Second thoughts, more doubts started building up
You're everything I wanted
Before I knew just what I wanted
And hey, hey, you're killing me on the inside
And you're the only one I want, I can't deny
Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I take your hand or let go?

Every time I feel your love, I get so caught up
It's your kissing, your touch, it's just everything
But I'm feeling like I wanna just run away
I'm here to tell you what I want
But you're everything I want

The pressure starts to build 
Build it up

It feels like bedtime
I get lonely
Thinking about you
Girl I dream of or think of at all?
(Are you into me, out of your mind for me?
Say you can't go a day without me)
Girl, I love you and I want you
And I need you, I need you, I need you
Whenever I'm near you
My love just comes down
Whenever I see you
I just want you around
'Cause I wanna feel you
All through the day and the night
Whenever I'm near you
It feels like bedtime
Whenever I'm near you
My love just comes down
Whenever I see you
I just want you around
'Cause I wanna feel you
All through the day and the night
Whenever I'm near you
It feels like bedtime
It feels like bedtimeYeah, ayo
2000, it's us
Yo, it's time to U-Turn
You heard me?
You're either with us or against us
It's been some years now
Since we hit the floor to get down
We always had a step to go with the sound
Now everybody wanna sit around, drink and ball
Remember the snake
And how the floor used to clear and everybody would break
What's crunk now used to be called getting to it
I'm bringing it all back, this is how we do it
Just...
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Get your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
In the '80s, fresh was the talk
MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk
In the '90s, I had a high flat top
Doing the wop, Pee-Wee to the Reebok
I can't forget about my high school days
The sound was Bobby Brown, the dance was the running man
Now everybody wanna push Bentleys
The year is 2, everybody, do the U-Turn
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Get your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn 
All you need to do is let go 
Let the tempo take over you
I came to have a good time
Let the rhythm deep inside your soul
Let it lead you to the floor , come on
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me
Come on, come on, it ain't hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me
Come on, come on, it ain't to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Get your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Get your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's...Yo!

Instead of acting like you supposed to
You cop an attitude like you're too good for me
And you know good and damn well that
If I wanted, I could take you from your man 
With my eyes closed, I could have you eating out the palm of my hand
And all your little girlfriends, too
Yes I can, and I will if I, if I want to
If I, if I want to, baby
Ain't nobody trying to clown you
But you're too damn old to play high school games with me
You know that, too damn old
Yes, you do
'Cause even when I'm not around you
I hear from my friends you be asking 'bout me
"What's up with him?" That's what you be saying
I don't really care
How long you've been together with your man
It's just a matter of time
Before I make you mine
I wanna make it clear
So there's no misunderstandings
That I get, what I want
When I want
If I wanted, I could take you from your man

It was beautiful when we first started
I don't wanna leave you, I just wanna keep you
When they saw me, they saw you
Damn the world, it's just me and my girl
That's how I felt
Every time I thought it was right, it went left
We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue 
I tell myself that I don't want you no more 
But I can't let you go 
So much love and hurt and hate 
People screaming it won't work
Time and time, I say I'm gonna leave 
But I can't let you go

You ain't even gotta wait till in the morning, man
You can get out of here tonight, man
Hey, yo, Glen, come grab her shit and get her out of here!
Baby, you ain't even gotta like me, but you're not gonna fight me
You can't walk away and say
I never gave you everything want, -thing ya need
All we ever do is argue all night long
I don't wanna leave you
See you with another brother loving you
Saying "damn the world, it's me and my girl"
That's how I feel when you think everything is real
But it really ain't
We used to laugh and party

Got me walking around, looking for somebody to slap
Got me going, going with no pause
Got me up in Cartier everyday just 'cause
Got me arguing about little stuff she don't call little stuff
It get a little rough, then we kiss and make up
She wanna say what she wanna, I don't play that
She wanna constantly bring up shit from way back
Got me thinking about her while I'm watching a flick
Got me dipping through traffic, trying to get home quick
Got me talking to myself, I'm hating this
Got me wanting to wild out like I'm Jadakiss
Got me in a place I never thought I would see
Got me not wanting to stay, not wanting to leave
Got me happy, got me confused
Got me wishing I could get it how I used to
We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue

Take off, yeah, take off
Usher, baby
Nobody's ever loved me like you do
That's just something I'm not used to, ooouuu
So I always push you away 
Even though I know I want you to stay with me
 I was the one who made you love me
 just when you was beginning to trust me
I do it all again, do it all again 
Hit her up again, hit her up again 
And you don't deserve it, she ain't even worth it
But I still do it anyway
And it breaks my heart, my heart
To know I break your heart, your heart
Believe me
I tried to apologize 
But I hurt you one too many times, baby
I had no reason why 
I just continue to make it right, ohhhh I
 I was the one who made you love me
 just when you was beginning to trust me, I
I do it all again, do it all again 
Hit her up again, hit her up again 
And you don't deserve it, she ain't even worth it
But I still do it anyway
And it breaks my heart, my heart
To know I break your heart, your heart
Oh baby I know
I hurt you so many times
I tried to change it
But I can't, it's apart of my life
And I don't wanna to lie to you
Although I always lie to you
And I don't like to lie to you 
But I always lie to you 
Sometimes it happens that way 
It happens that way 
Girl, I hate that it happens that way 
But it happens that way 
Ohhh 
I do it all again, do it all again 
Hit her up again, hit her up again 
And you don't deserve it , she ain't even worth it
But I still do it anyway
And it breaks my heart, my heart
To know I break your heart
, your heart
Hey, oh, believe meI can't let nothing come in between the two of us
'Cause it's like you're all I need since we've been together
And, whenever I'm in need of a little love
It's okay for me to open up
But I just can't give my heart to anyone, girl
Some only come in your life for a season
And stay a while, giving you a reason
To take temporary and think that it's forever
But you've given me someone that I can believe in
I know that there will be times we can't come to an agreement
But I know we'll figure out the ups and downs
Tell me, are you willing to take a chance?
Baby, if so...
Let me put you in my hands
I wanna be your man
Let's do it right so that you'll be with me a lifetime
You know I ain't talking crazy
Your mama and my mama want some grand-babies tonight
Would you be with me for a lifetime?
I used to think it was hopeless and I should just give it up 
But I couldn't stop until I found myself a good girl 
I checked every state and city and looked all around the world
And I'm proud to say that my search ends here
'Cause you're one in a million to me
And I can't let you go, baby
Some only come in your life for a season
And stay a while, giving you a reason
To take temporary and think that it's forever
But you've given me someone that I can believe in
I know that there will be times we can't come to an agreement

However, love can be the reason you fall
And when you find that special someone
You'll be willing to give them a lifetime
I love you and I choose you
Follow me
Some only come in your life for a season
And stay a while, giving you a reason
To take temporary and think that it's forever
But you've given me someone that I can believe in

You know I ain't talking crazy
Your mama and my mama want some grand-babies...Oh, for you, I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin, it's time to sink or swim
Watch them play for you
For you I'd be running a thousand miles
Just to get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot, but coming from you
I admit I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby, listen
I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love, girl
Somebody to love, I don't need nothing else
I promise, girl, I swear, I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
I need somebody, I, I need somebody to love
Every day, I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds
Smile for me 
I would take every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime 
Step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot, but coming from you
I admit I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention

Uh, you got it going on, what what
C'mon, c'mon, haha
Strictly fuck with those six-digit niggas
If the first one is a nine, they a buck behind
I live my rhyme at the same time, can't find myself laying up
If you ain't paying up, bullets start spraying up
You know my niggas is sick
The game ain't enough for you to run up in this
I need stacks of chips, you know, dream house money
Shit, you just like me, so don't start acting funny
You're the kind of girl that makes
Everybody feel that you're just so damn good
So damn good
But your secrets, I've found out
So don't deny what you're about
I know the truth
You know I do, I do 'cause....
I know you get lonely 
And you want it 
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me
I know you get lonely 
And you want it 
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me
Quiet is kept you cry for help
When no one else is there I bet you touch yourself
Does it feel good?
Late night calls, I bet you do it all
Anything to get it off
But you still persist to front on me
Baby, tell me
Why do we play this game of chase
When we know we both feel the same way?
And why do you put me through all these changes
When you know you're just a freak like me?
You're just like me
If I had one wish in the world, I swear to God
It would be for girls to rock pearls, straight out the oyster
Voice your opinion, Queen Bee made a million
Got mirrors on my ceiling, so I can see it
When your head be in between it, if I had a penis
I'd be heartless, for real, though, niggas start shit
I'd just flash out my dildo, y'all move too quick
Thought I'd be memorized by your cocaine bricks
And you smoke gray six, nigga, I thought you was a groupie
Obsessed fan with my pictures in your hooptie
You heard my record, now you know I'm freaky
So you, wanna wreck it and you, wanna see me
How your dreams be, you want me sexual
In a gun fight, two on three, I'm next to pull
And I love life, something you never could imagine
Then you woke the fuck up, it's just rapping
I know you get lonely 
And you want it 
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me
I know you get lonely 
And you want it 
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me
Don't front like you don't, you're just like me
Just like me
Just like me
Just like me, yeah

(Yeah, Usher, baby

Girl, it's been a while
So I thought I'd hit you up
You never left my mind
Let's pick it up where we left off
The last time I left you thirsty, baby
So let me fill you up
Yeah, it's been a minute
I know you miss the way we touch
You can think about you don't want it
You don't wanna come across too anxious
Gonna see if you're ready for the second round
Girl, I'm in your town, come over
Girl, don't let me down, I won't be here for long
I'll show you a good time, one that we'll both remember
Girl, give me your best, expect none less, girl
Said you wouldn't, but you did it, oh girl
I can tell you don't regret it 'cause you ain't been touched like this
Since the last time
The feeling that I get every time we connect, oh, there it is
One more kiss and I'm out, but I'll be back around
Baby, you can hang around if you want to
But I gotta be out, handle some B.I
When I get back, get ready for the second round
Girl, I'm in your town, come over
Girl, don't let me down, I won't be here for long
I'll show you a good time, one that we'll both remember

I'll show you a good time, one that we'll both remember
Girl, give me your best, expect none less, girlCheck it out
I'm saying
You gonna be mine
First time I saw you, baby, you did something to me
That no else has ever done
It's something in your eyes caught me by surprise
And told me that you were the one
But what's bad is I know you got a man
And he'll never understand
The chemistry between me and you
Something inside of me
Is saying you and I were meant to be
If you can think it, you can have it
That why I believe...
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
Now, every time I see you, baby, it's plain to see
That I'm everything you've been missing at home, baby
So much love to share, it's something in the air
Telling me I should never leave you alone
But even though I know you got a man
He'll never understand
The chemistry between me and you
You can try to stop it, but it won't quit
You say you don't when I know that you want it
I know, one day you'll be mine
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's aroundAhhhh 
Look how far we've come
You're still here 
This is us 
These  are my confessions
Still going strong
 yeah, man...
Let it go...Walking with my head down
Counting every step
Hoping that the next one
Brings me closer to the man I was
'Cause I was way better
Maybe it's because
We were together
I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's why I'm looking for myself
Who am I?
Someone, remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life, I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow, I ran right into
You 
You 
You 
And somehow, I ran right into you
Escaping on the tightrope
Trying not to fall
If I don't keep my balance
I know I will lose it all
I should have known better
And it's all my fault
That we're not together
I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's why I'm looking for myself
Who am I?
Someone, remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life, I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow, I ran right into
You 
You 
You 
And somehow, I ran right into you
I was on a journey
Trying to figure out who I really was
Then I realized that
When you're not here
Half of me is gone
So in order for me to find me
I had to find you
You know? 
And I got a funny feeling that 
You won't know who you are
And unless you find me 
It's like...
You look in the mirror 
And you see the person that you truly love
I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's why I'm looking for myself
Who am I?
Someone, remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life, I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow, I ran right into
You 
You 
You 
And somehow, I ran right into you
You 
You 
You 
And somehow, I ran right into youJust tell me where to go

Oh babe, I know what you like
And I would make love to you forever and ever
Into the night

Usher...
You gonna wanna tell everybody 'bout how I got you all
Coming when I call, you know I'll break you off
And if these walls could talk, they would tell everybody
'Bout how I put it down, you know I shut you down
Got you up off the ground, yes, I can't be wasted
And if I let you on my spaceship, you'll have to let me taste it
Hop on it, I'ma give you a ride
'Cause we gonna make love all through the nightAll the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby
I feel so strange thinking about you
After all the wrong you've done to me
I can't go on feeling like I do
'Cause my heart loves you, I'm so confused
All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby
Don't waste my time
Cause someone like me you'll never find
I thought we had a good thing
But I was wrong and now I must move on
To another love, one that I can trust
With my heart, I know she'll never run away
Just can't talk no more, so I'm out the door
Talk to me, why you wanna play love games?
All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby
All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby
To another love, one that I can trust
With my heart, I know she'll never run away
Just can't talk no more, so I'm out the door
Talk to me, why you wanna play love games?
All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby
All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, babyThat last hour was the worst
When we remember forever
Blessing and a curse
If we could fall back one more hour
Maybe we could've made it work
Maybe we could've focused on each other first 
Could've left off on better terms
If we could fall back one more hour
Daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could revisit that moment again
I would never let us end that way
Like daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could fall back one more hour
I watch time slip away
Like true love with no grip, that's right
Seen blue skies fade to gray, oh
If we could fall back one more hour
Maybe we could've made it work
Maybe we could've focused on each other first
Could've left off on better terms 
If we could fall back one more hour
Daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could revisit that moment again
I would never let us end that way
Like daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could fall back one more hour
Maybe we could've made it work
Maybe we could've focused on each other first 
Could've left off on better terms
Oh, wish we could fall back one more hour
Like daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could fall back one more hour 
Daylight savings, ah, ha
Daylight savings
Wish I could go back, ah ha ah haIt's crazy
I can't believe that you
Would be the one to do
Do me like you do
Get back here, baby
When you let me have my way
I was thinking I could get it again
Baby, we could be friends if you're lonely
And then you showed me just how quick your tires could spin
You were off in the wind, tell me, where did you go?
When you left, I'm thinking, "Which way did she go?"
I should have known that you led me on, girl
I'm in the wind on cruise control
I gotta be dreaming 'cause I never felt like this before
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her?
Now it's raining and I'm looking over at the passenger side
Thinking back in my mind how you set me off
She was stopping and dropping me, switching from fast to slow
But that had nothing on how you got when I got you home
When you left, I'm thinking, "Which way did she go?"
The way you touched yourself had me up the wall
I'm in the wind on cruise control
I'm searching for you 'cause I can't seem to let you go
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her?
You know
I really only thought
That this would be a one night stand
What you doing to me?
Come on
What you doing to me?
Maybe she's running home to someone else
Or maybe she lost my number in her cell
Or maybe she's run it down like this before
'Cause I can't see her not coming back for more, more
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her?
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her?Re-introduction to a feeling I don't wanna know
Yeah, I've been running, but it caught me somehow
The rule was never fall in love, I did it anyway
You make my heartbeat keep pumping, why the hell you turn it up so loud?
'Cause the fire don't fear the water
And the night don't fear a thief
It's just you and me together
Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria
Here we are, we are, we are
And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria
I really know the way and thought I could get in and out
She said, "Relax, you gonna be here for a while"
But I threw caution to the wind and did it anyway
And the truth is, I'm learning to love it and I ain't gonna turn it down
'Cause the fire don't fear the water
And the night don't fear a thief
Once the music sets you over
Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
Here we are, we are, we are
And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria
Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria
And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoriaWe got all night, baby
Yeah, I'ma take my time with you
Now, listen
You know how daddy like it
I'm here to see you, momma
Just let me do me, all right?
Maybe it's the pressure of knowing that I'm watching you perform
Or maybe you're not used to someone who knows exactly what you want
I know the fire's burning, but baby, there's no need to be alarmed
And you can be the rain that's falling, girl, and I'll be the thunderstorm
You got no need to be nervous
Because you are safe in my hands
I'm sure you'll be needing my service
Baby your wish will be my command
'Cause I'ma touch you with my mind, kiss you with my body
If you give me time, I know you won't be sorry
This ain't Bump N' Grind, I'll show you what love is
If you let me lay you down
I promise you ain't going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere
Girl, not until you let me lay you down in here
When you're cold, I wanna be the one that keeps you warm
I'll make your body come to me, pull you back when you try to run, baby
Baby, I'll go deeper, open up if you're ready for me to feed you
Yeah, tell me who you are 
It's going down right here
'Cause I'ma touch you with my mind, kiss you with my body
If you give me time, I know you won't be sorry
This ain't Bump N' Grind, I'll show you what love is
If you let me lay you down
I promise you ain't going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere
Girl, not until you let me lay you down in here
All that I want
Is to squeeze you, touch you, kiss you, baby
And I'll provide you with that
Special kind of loving
You ain't gon' want nothing but me
You ain't going nowhere
I'll show you what love is if you let me lay you down
I promise you ain't going nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going
No, you won't be sorry
You ain't going nowhere
Girl, not until you let me lay you down in hereThe game 'bout to change, Usher

We take people for granted till they're out of sight
I don't think that you know how much I'm going through
I don't think that you know how much I really love you
All I do, is think of you

And what I never got was her, yeah
And what I never got was her
My emotions are just running away with me
Pulling me to my toes, taking me off my feet
Running, yeah I'm running if I know I'll get to where you are
I should think about it, but this happens with my heart
And I don't care, baby I'm all in there
Nothing I wouldn't do for you
'Cause the one thing in the world that I'm sure of, baby it's you
I'm sold out on this love, it's the only thing I'm sure of

Farther than I've ever gone for you

Oohh, yeah yea-yeah, your love
Your love , yea-yeah, your love
Ush, Ush, get up man
Ush, GodLove, such a lonely place
Nobody wants to be alone
To have the world, but no one to share it with
I am so alone
I can't stand this feeling of being without you
Yes, I'll do
Whatever it takes to prove I truly love you
Don't let me go
Let's stay together
Forever and ever
Can't sleep without you by my side
Help meUh, this is for my
This is for my, one love, one love
I had a dream when I was just a little boy
To find a girl like you
We would meet at the park after school
And talk 'til the day was through
Then, you take me to your parent's house
And I would comb your hair
And we would dream of all the cities
And places we could go
Oh, oh, oh
Say the words that you know I wanna hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We don't need to know the time
We could stay 'til the day turns to night
I can still remember dreams as a little boy
Now, I’m a man and still can't put down my toys
Real love will never come if you in it now
But I had to learn that lesson down in the south
Back to spending nights on the town, just to have a little fun
In my mind, I'm wishing she’s the one 
Is this too close to reality
For you to be that girl from my fantasy?
Say the words that you know I wanna hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We don't need to know the time
We could stay 'til the day turns to night
She stole my head and let’s go play the dream again
To find a girl like you 
I look into your eyes
And I see our universe 
I look into your eyes
And I see our universe 
Say the words that you know I wanna hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We don't need to know the time
We could stay 'til the day turns to night
Say the words that you know I wanna hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We don't need to know the time
We could stay 'til the day turns to night

You didn't know
Little secret
It ain't what you got, baby
It's what you do with it
And you doing it
You doing it
My guilty pleasure is inspiring my desire
Caught in a love affair with feminine iconic style
So fine, you got good taste
But I hate to see your pretty body going to waste
Prefer to see you in the bare necessities
Like Coco de Mer or La Perla, baby
Getting me aroused in that intimate attire
Erotic fantasies, you know just what I like
Vicky got a secret, everybody knows
Lady in the street, in bed hoes and me
Wearing Cosabella
With nothing but a trench coat, nothing's better
Girl, you're sexy
When you slip it on
Love to see you in it
If you add a little spice, you can have a lot of fun
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?
Girl, you're a goddess, when you slip that Eres on
Don't stop, your sexy silhouette on the wall turns me on
Good God, your bod
And our bod keep deep
Don't mope when I say nice, but nasty
I wanna tell your man, I do what I say
Girl, you're sexy
When you slip it on
Love to see you in it
If you add a little spice, you can have a lot of fun
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Wanna make me harder?
Put it on, here's what I want you to do
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?
What you gonna do? You gonna put it on?
Girl, you so sexy, you ain't gotta take it off
I want you to feed my fetish, slide them thigh-highs down
You looking at me, got me up
Throw them heels back on, come one
Put it on
Girl, you know you turn me on
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie

Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?
I'ma take it off, girl
I'ma put it on, girlI've walked alone and felt as if no one cared
All the days so dark and dim
But it's like the rays of the sun somehow came down
To shine when you are around
And I always thought that I'd never find that one
To make me feel forever young
But if I had one wish
My life to share would be with you and no one else
If I had open arms, would you have a heart to spare?
If ever you want me near
I'll be there to run and say and I'm here
Giving you someone that understands
And a love that will never end
I can be all that you need and moreRaymond versus Raymond
There's three sides to every story
There's one side, there's the other
And then there's the truth

Remember that time I was sitting up sick, couldn't sleep in the middle of the night?
You said, "Bae, let me take you to the ER"
I said, "Nah, I'ma be alright"
Well, the next day I found out from fucking around that the sickness I had was life
And I was fixed to keeping the decision to keep it
Knowing I had to get rid of it, rid of it
Live with it, he don't know, you don't know I had to deal with it
You thought what you put me on from Part II was the realest shit
It ain't right, I ain't proud, I won't cry, I can't hide
But when it was you, I was strong
Now it's you, what you gon' do?
I would do anything, to get your trust back
I hid and I know what you mean, and you can trust that
I realize that we're both wrong
And no more lies, we could move on
If you lose that trust you built for so long
Now that's the test to see if you're strong, to see if you're strong
Yeah, that's the test to see if you're strong
You realize what I just told you?
You don't realize it, huh?
Well you can play it back
Yeah, these are my confessions, 'fessions, 'fessions, 'fessionsI can't believe my eyes
Looking at your sexy ass body
The way you do it with your hands up
I just wanna be all over
Let me rock, with you
Don't let nothing interrupt this groove
Going at it like we 'bout to
Touching all on you like you're my girl
You probably saying that's a damn shame 
I don't even know your name 
I know it probably won't matter tonight
'Cause you been all on me I'm like, "okay!" 
Suggest we take this here home 
So we can make a love song
I can be the best part of you waking up
Shorty, holler at me if that sound, okay
I see you wanna take it slow
Go on, drop it to the floor real low
You know I want you bad 'cause I been all on that ass
And you ain't looking at me sideways
And the DJ is playing the last song
And it's coming down to our last call, be ready
This slow jam is 'specially dedicated
What better way for the night to end?
Come on
You probably saying that's a damn shame
I don't even know your name 
I know it probably won't matter tonight 
'Cause you been all on me I'm like, "okay!"
Suggest we take this here home
So we can make a love song 
I can be the best part of you waking up
Shorty, holler at me if that sound, okay 
Ooh, cars outside waiting, baby, if you're ready to roll
Now that I got you opened up
Curious of mine
To know what's on your mind, girl
Girl, we been at it so long, I can't wait
Just wanna make sure we on the same page
Come on, come on, come on
I be on some other shit when that liquor talk
And I know you...
You probably saying that's a damn shame 
I don't even know your name 
I know it probably won't matter tonight
'Cause you been all on me I'm like, "okay!"
Suggest we take this here home 
So we can make a love song 
I can be the best part of you waking up
Shorty, holler at me if that sound, okay
You probably saying that's a damn shame 
I don't even know your name 
I know it probably won't matter tonight
'Cause you been all on me I'm like, "okay!"
Suggest we take this here home 
So we can make a love song 
I can be the best part of you waking up
Shorty, holler at me if that sound, okay ...Wishes, wonder, magic, colder
Time stands still, can't explain what I feel
If this is really real, nothing's ever gonna be the same
I get to say goodbye to the struggle in life
Say hello to the skies, spread my wings and fly away
Even though life's been knocking me down
I have to figure it out, see my way through the doubt
And when it seems I'm lost, turn and found my way
What I got in my hands could be the spark
Turns it all around, could this be happening now?
'Cause all my life I've waited for this day
Tell me what do you do when everyone's counting on you?
Thе decisions you make, the givе and the take
The promises kept, and the ones that you break are the hardest to take
But, ohh, we'll always be standing by you
No, I won't give up, I won't give in
'Cause the day that you run might be the day that you win
Even when life's knocking you down
You always figure it out, see your way through the doubt
And when you're lost I help you find your way
What you got in your hands could be the spark
Turns it all around, is this happening now?
'Cause all my life I've knew we'd see this day
I knew we'd see this day
I knew we both would see this day
You know all your dreams are calling
On this day
It's out there if you want it
Don't be afraid
Believe and know your best is yet to come
'Cause all my life I've waited for this day
Waiting for this day 
Waiting for this day 
Waiting for this day
Waiting for this day 
Waiting for this day 
Waiting for this day 
Forget about yesterday 
It's dead and gone away 
The only thing that matters is right now 
Forget about yesterday

Forget about yesterday 
It's dead and gone away 
Oh, everything we wanted is happening right now
 It's magical yeah
Baby, let's own it 
Forget about yesterday 
It's dead and gone away 
The only thing that matters is right now
All my life I've 
Waited for this 
We waited for so long, so long we've waited for
This dayYo.... after tonight
Don't leave your girl 'round me
True playa for real, ask my nigga Pharrell
Detroit Rock City ballin, Philly batters and Boston
It don't matter where we at, we travelin often
It don't matter what we pack, the gat'll be coughin'
That'll be that, either that or your faculty's softin'
Ladies stack that, ass phat when they walkin'
Gallopin like horses, Jesus, I just wanna get in between ya
Like, chilly when you thinkin of me
But really you leavin Dallas, Austin, it's happenin often
I really could read you, rather by payment to please
To spoon feed, really who needs you
The longer I get, the longer I please you
Five Nine'll creep wit the people, keepin it diesel
But who could forget you, I'm keepin it street
While I'm shootin this missle, reachin and heat seekin this freaks
Royce 5'9" is literally the head nigga that's breathin
The reason that chivalry is dead, so please
Situations will arise, in our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations, with the guys, I sacrificed
Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
Meanwhile I, I, I, I, I... I loved you, you were my girl

And again no story can end without it

I can't keep it together
I usually don't show my emotions
But it ain't getting better
'Cause you can't be blind with eyes wide open
And I see struggle, I see pain
I see only the mess we made
I see things that I can't change
And it hurts my heart to say
I cry
For the sons without fathers
And the pain that their mothers
Hold deep inside
And I'll fight
For the future we're making
It can change if we face it
'Cause these tears won't dry
So I cry
Ooh 
Ooh
When I look in the mirror
Do I see someone that cares for others?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Do I love myself more than my sisters 
And brothers? 
I don't know, ooh
Now, I've seen struggles, I've seen pain
I've seen beyond the mess we made
I've seen things that I cannot change
And it hurts my heart to say
Oh, I cry
For the sons without fathers
And the pain that their mothers
Hold deep inside
So I'll fight
For the future we're making
It'll change if we face it
'Cause these tears won't dry
So I cry
Ooh
I cry
Ooh 
For the truth that's unspoken
For the promises broken
I will stand by your side
I'll fight
For the ones who stopped dreaming
And the ones who stopped believing
You're not alone
I feel your pain
I cry
For the sons without fathers
And the pain that their mothers
Hold deep inside, hey
I'll fight
For the future we're making
Only changes if we face it
It's love over pride
I'll cry
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll cryYeah, let me holla at you real quick
I'ma bring y'all back to the good old, good old days
You feel me?
Some of that
Good old, good old, good old ghetto, good old
Good old, good old ghetto
Good old, good old ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Good old...
I told my man I'm having a barbecue
So grab some folks and won't you slide right through
He brought this shorty that I used to know
It brought me back to when I was in school
She said, "Usher where have you been?
We used to kick it every now and then
Remember when I used to call your phone
And tell you come on 'cause my mama's gone
How about them times I had to throw a rock at your window
To let you know
To come downstairs and open the door?
And after that, baby, it was on, fa sho"
Now, honey got my head spinning around, for real
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout how good you used to feel
And I got a girl now and I don't get down like this
But I must admit I'm tempted and starting to reminisce
'Cause...
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto
Now, she's asking me to take her
On a tour of my house so we can catch up
For all the time lost since I blew up
And became the man that drops his pants and every girl around the world is dying to love
Break the beat down, let me tell you what I'm talking about
If you're not careful, it'll turn you out
It's that way she used to go when you want it nice and slow
Even though you can't, the memory will make you want some more
She used to understand me, touch me, hold me
Taught me how to be a man
She used to kiss me, all them things she used to show me
Damn, I wish that I could do it again
Honey got my head spinning around, for real
Cause I’m thinking ‘bout how good you used to feel
But I got a girl now and, yo, she’s right upstairs
And I must admit I’m tempted and starting to not care
'Cause...
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto
Never had somebody that's so bad
Somebody with a whole lot of body
Attitude that'll make you wanna leave the one you with
'Cause you know how good it is
Not a prissy, little missy, baby, talk that slang
I used to love how she kissed me when she popped that thing
She was a friend of the fam, hot without the glam, not
When I be tripping, she didn't really give a damn, stop
It's what I need to do 'cause I know what this is leading to
If I keep on thinking about that back and I'm gonna be right back in it
'Cause, yo...
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghettoKiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss

Pandora's box is open
Blame brings pain
Accusations seal these walls
Walls built up to shield from pain
Pain of finding fault, revolving back to pain
And we need to stop

Just like a revolver babe, but I'd rather resolve it, babe
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver 
Just like a revolver babe, but we gotta resolve it, babe

Bitten and it's potent, you hate it and I know it
Pandora's box is open
Blame brings pain
Accusations seal these walls
Walls built up to shield from pain
Pain of finding fault, revolving back to pain
And we need to stop
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver 
Just like a revolver babe, but I'd rather resolve it, babe
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver 
Just like a revolver babe, but we gotta resolve it, babe

1-2-3
It was, like, six of us
Three in the Benz, three in the truck
On 85, headed to the Plush
10 minutes later is when we pulled up
I parked the Benz
Hit the alarm, glanced down at my rims
Tucked in my pant leg in the tongue of my Timbs
Hand in my shirt to reveal the gems
Proceeded to walk in, just then, I saw this
Magnificent misses
Sipping on a glass of Cris
With a couple of her friends giggling
I knew...
You are the one
I don't give a damn
Even if you got a man
Take my hand, girl
You are the one
Girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance
Take a chance, girl
Said, I know you got a few with you
Don't even trip, I got my crew here, too
Keep it real, what you wanna do?
I really wanna chill with you
Tell your friends
They can hop in the truck, we'll take the Benz
But if we split up, maybe we can hook up again
You never know, I guess that all depends
If I can get you from the floor to the door of my six-O-O
Two-O momo's and low Pro's
So finish that Mo', get your coat
Tell your girls, "come on, let's go"
'Cause you are...
You are the one
I don't give a damn
Even if you got a man
Take my hand, girl
You are the one
Girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance
Take a chance, girl
You are the one

Somebody tell me
Why do people stay in situations that'll never work?
And 'bout you wanna leave and you can't wait to get even
But deep inside, it really hurts
You never should've ever got in the mix
You never understand till you go through it
All the right things to say, the wrong things to do
Why you out and trying to pick and choose?
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
I used to be young and dumb and always wanted to run
In the streets 'cause I thought that was where it was at
But it wasn't, all it did was leave a brother in the cold
With nowhere to go
I caught myself slipping, thinking I was the lick
I was tripping, trying to jump dip to dip
I thought it was the way to be happy
Until somebody took time to tell me
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
So many people think they got it, but they don't have a clue
You gotta have more than just a body for me to be talking about you
Take it from me, when playing the game, your day will come
When you gotta stop what you doing, start looking for the one
Don't stop
Keep looking, fellas
Don't stop
You got to get it, get it
All and together now
Keep looking, fellas
Don't stop
You got to get it, get it
Don't stop
Keep looking, fellas
Don't stop 
You got to get it, get it
Don't stop
Keep looking, fellas
Don't stop
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with

See her face whenever I I look at you
Won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
Thought that she was the one for me
Till I found out she was on her creep

Wish I knew 
U remind me

I wanna see you happyYeah, woo!!
If you, only knew I already sized you up
Sitting next to me, looking so tough
And you're fixing your hair, running your game
Telling me I only want one thing, girl
Sincerity's what you need for now
In a while, the truth will all come out
And it's almost unfair to me
What you wanna say, baby? Ready to see
It's so clear to me
It's that everyone will hear you speaking
Whatever I wanna do, it's whatever I wanna do
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever you say, it's just giving me room
Whatever I want, baby, I can do
Whatever I want
You can't get enough
Man, conversation, I can feel your touch
You losing points trying to play the role
Let's keep it cool, nonsexual
Girl, I know how you feel
But you don't want it for real
It's whatever I wanna do
You don't even know what you gotten into
It's so clear to me
It's that everyone will hear you speaking
Whatever I wanna do, it's whatever I wanna do
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I, whatever I wanna do
It's whatever I wanna do, baby, oh
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever you say, it's just giving me room
Whatever I want, baby, I can do
Whatever I want
It just ain't right, you're feeling so frustrated
You can't stop the feeling, the feeling is close to me
Girl, you know that everything you need is right here
So now, when we do whatever we want to, oh yeah
Whatever I want
It's so clear to me
It's that everyone will hear you speaking
Whatever I wanna do, it's whatever I wanna do
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever you say, it's just giving me room
Whatever I want, baby, I can do
Whatever I want
It's so clear to me
It's that everyone will hear you speaking
Whatever I wanna do, it's whatever I wanna do
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever you say, it's just giving me room
Whatever I want, baby, I can do
Whatever I want
Whatever I want
Whatever I wantYou make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
This is what you do, this is what you do
This is what you do, this is what you do
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about is you
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
What's sad is I love her, but I'm falling for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it while all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
Come along with
You're making me, you're making me
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
Before anything began between us...
The one I used to run and talk to...
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about is you
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make meWhen you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go
I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad
When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars 
Flowers, cards and candy
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her: "I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world"
Ladies say: "I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can"
See, I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else...Usher, Usher, Usher

Just how quick your tires could spin
You were off in the wind

I'm thinkin which way did she go
I should have known that you would lead me on girl
Im in the wind on cruise control
I gotta be dreamin cuz i never felt like this before
It was supposed to be

In and out and im out the door
So why am i sittin here
At the red light
Drivin round lookin out for her
Lookin out for her
Yeah!
Yeah! 
She had a coke bottle shack really big booty small waist
I feel a little yozzy cause I really wanna see her face one more 
That woman's got me messed up in my head I forgot about my thought
And what I said all I could remember is one night more then 
One hour on one floor 
There was one red light by the bed
That was glowing of her skin when I did my thang
We was dripping with a little bit of sweat and a whole lot of lost
Cause I really most of diggin her friend
All I wanna say is that we handle ours
And there ain't too many women that could handle stars
And what I wouldn't just one more time
For the chance to grip their handle bars
It was supposed to be
Just a one night
In and out and im out the door
But she's got me sittin here
At the red light
Drivin round lookin out for her
It was supposed to be
Just a one night
In and out and im out the door
So why am i sittin here
At the red light
Drivin round lookin out for her
Lookin out for her
Looking out for her!Turn the lights on
Now it all seems like a blur
All the things we saw and heard
At least for me, it was a first
Do you remember that night in Amsterdam?
Do you remember that night in Amsterdam? Ohhh
Maybe you were too gone, maybe I was gone too
And I knew I was on you, and I didn't even want to land
'Cause I remember clearly, yeah
So hard to describe the energy
You had to be there, you had to feel it for yourself
Walking through the static of the aromatics
Started from the bottom, made it to the attic
Hoping I don't leave up out this bitch an addict
Halfway to the plane and we still going at it 
You was so sexy, cursing out taxi drivers
You were so public, you was like fuck it, let me ride it! 
So I did, and you did
Had that man getting big
Wishing I could take you back to where I live
Thought about you all the way back to the crib
Now it all seems like a blur
All the things we saw and heard
At least for me, it was a first
Do you remember that night in Amsterdam?
Do you remember that night in Amsterdam? Ohhh
Maybe you were too gone, maybe I was gone too
I know I was on you, and I didn't even want to land
'Cause I remember clearly, yeah
All those smoky rooms filled with tiny dancers
And all those voices calling my name, and I ain't tryna answer
And when you lay down on me, I couldn't help but stand
Had me all at attention, lost in this wonderland
I was so in tune, didn't notice anyone else that was in the room
Made a small shower, saw all the wall flowers
Didn't have any other choice but to bloom
Each moment run to the other, saw the beauty in every color
With me standing in the light
And you was like, "let me get a light"
Now it all seems like a blur
All the things we saw and heard
At least for me, it was a first
Do you remember that night in Amsterdam?
Do you remember that night in Amsterdam? Ohhh
Maybe you were too gone, maybe I was gone too
But fuck it I was on you, and I didn't even want to land
'Cause I remember clearly, yeah

Would I be here today if I didn't let it spray
I never said that I was perfect
Nobody walkin on this earth is
At night, I would've gotten murdered
If I ain't grab the hatchet and let them cowards have it
(Ohh, that's the boy Shyne y'all
It's ya boy on his way home man, the boy on his way home man)
  These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all, 
Damn near cried when I got that phone call 
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions
Chorus - Usher] 
These are my confessions, just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way 
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all, 
Damn near cried when I got that phone call 
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confession
If you got something to confess to right now step to the mic Twista
I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus coupe
Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth
And I confess about the days I was rollin' my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill
And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real
And I confess that, just when I thought I could really try to get away
While havin other women on the side
But I never knew that it would catch up wit' a nigga one day
You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson'
If you stay with me then it'll be a blessin', no stressing
It'll never be no guessin'
Cause I pulled one out my heart and these are my confessions
Yeah Kanye To tha College Dropout
Man, how does she bring it up how does she break it down
Man you at the clinic, dawg slow down that's yo child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin
And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
You know it ain't y'all little secret
You famous you can't go nowhere cause everytime you go there
There's hoes there so basiclly you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her "man don't say that"
Matter fact like Pat, don't say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin on paychecks
Things come up from way way way back I confessBy the end of the night
You're gonna leaving with me for sure
And by the end of the night
You're gon' be screaming for more, oh-ho
One step, two step that body to me
Unlock your love and I'll set you free
And if the feeling is right
We could get freaky for life, oh-ho
I've been thinking 'bout you tonight
Oh god, you've been looking so good tonight
I wanna see how you move tonight

Something hot
Something sexy
With the groove on
Go through the records

What you needa play
I wanna relax my mind
It's been a long day
Turn it up, get me open
With the right song

To slow it down
And play some Joe
You know the one
Can we break it down
I've waited so long
Put it onOh baby
I love you
Why did you go away?
Sitting in my window, day by day
Thinking of your face
Nothing in the world so strong
To take the tears away
Since you took your love away
My heart has not a home
Can't stop these tears from coming down
I just don't know what I did wrong
Can't stop thinking of you
And you know I don't stop
My world's lost without you
I'm so lost without you, baby
Baby, baby
No, no
Can't stop thinking of you
My world's lost without youSay, you'd never give away your heart again
I'll be knocking till you let me in
I know you told me you'd rather be lonely, you don't even know me
That's why I no longer want to be a stranger
Sorry you put your trust in others and they let you down
And all the the secrets and unknown evidence now in the open that you found
Cried yourself to sleep so many nights, said you'd never again
I'm not the one you hold it against, baby, it's not my blame
Girl, you independent as hell
And doing it by yourself
But what you gon' do when the night time get cold?
I know you told me you'd rather be lonely
You don't even know me
I ain't moving out the way for nothing
I'm stubborn
'Cause you say you'd never give away your heart again
I'll be knocking till you let me in
I want the title of your closest friend, baby
I no longer want to be a stranger
Tell me
What I gotta do 
What I gotta do
What I gotta do 
What I gotta do, what I gotta do 
What I gotta do
You're stuck inside, no matter how hard you try to forget
Don't you wish there was a button we can reset and make it easy
But you can't take back the decision that you made to love
I know it's one that you regret and not too proud of
Because you keep telling me
Girl, you independent as hell
And doing it by yourself
But what you gon' do when the night time get cold?
I know you told me you'd rather be lonely
You don't even know me
I ain't moving out the way for nothing
I'm stubborn
'Cause you say you'd never give away your heart again
I'll be knocking till you let me in
I want the title of your closest friend, baby
I no longer want to be a stranger
Baby, tell me
What I gotta do, what I gotta do
What I gotta do 
What I gotta do, what I gotta do
What I gotta do
I remember the break-up
And the condition that my heart was in
But I would never surrender, no, no
I gotta be stronger, there's nothing time can't heal
Girl, I know your scarred
All I ask is a chance to come in and do my part
It's nothing but fear and you been holding on since
Too under pressure and I see you sinking in
Say, you'd never give away your heart again
I'll be knocking till you let me in
I know you told me you'd rather be lonely, you don't even know me
That's why I no longer want to be a stranger
What I gotta do 
What I gotta do, what I gotta do
What I gotta do, what I gotta do
What I gotta doYo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo

Kisser, kisser, kisserYeah
Usher
Yeah
Everyday he wakes up in his million dollar home
His life is like a video, the only reality he knows
He jumps inside of his hundred thousand dollar car
Cruising up the boulevard
Driving pass people living hard
Complains about the gas prices but still supports the war
He complains about his 6-figure salary, tax to feed the poor
He doesn't understand the homeless, doesn't think it's genocide
That millions die from three lethal letters
He does sh** to make it better 
And I'm thinking of you
Everyone wants to touch the sky
Nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly
Everybody wants heaven
If you don't want to sacrifice
Don't say nothing, don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing
She watches television full of fabricated show
Thinks the world is just a joke, but oh little does she know
That there is a real life drama happening right outside her door
'Cause She continues to ignore, but she's like the tv-! the story repeats
She's searching through the channels
Skipping pass the news, she's more entertained by lies and gossip
'Cause it hurts to see the truth
She complains about the nation
Think it's a waste of time to vote
She says the one that has been corrupted forever
No one tries to make it better
And I'm thinking who
Everyone wants to touch the sky 
Nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly 
Everybody wants heaven 
If you don't want to sacrifice 
Don't say nothing, don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing 
Oooooo-Hush 
Don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing
Yeah, yeahReal talk, Usher, just blaze, you know
Oh, oh
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here with me
And now that day's here, you man gotta shed tears, right
You never miss a good thing till it leaves you
Finally I realize that I need you
I want you back, baby girl I need you back
Gotta have you back, babe
Heartbroken when you left my world
Man I wish I woulda kept my girl
And I love you
I don't know what I'm gon' do without my baby

I'm goin' outta my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now
Aw baby, what you say now?
And still I want you, want you
Want you, want you, want you, need you, babe
If I could rewind the time
And get inside your mind
I would take back all my words
I didn't see it, I couldn't see what I was doin', babe
See baby girl I was blind
And I wish I could try
To be the man that you deserve
Give me one chance to make it work

The love of my life
But I wasn't loving you right, baby

You must have just moved around the way, right?
I see all the fellows have been pressing you for your number
I'd like to get to know you, so um...
Maybe we can spend some time and just talk on the phone or something
I can think of many ways to say "I love you"
And with those many ways, there comes a time
For me to say I'll put no girl before you
So pretty lady, make up your mind
Girl, you look surprised, I've got conversation
'Cause you ain't checking for the kids I swing with, no
Girl, can't we please get past impressions?
'Cause what I feel for you, I swear is legit
Your girls tell you watch him, he's an entertainer
They say I'll hurt you and break your heart
They don't know, well, well, just what I'm feeling
From the first time I saw you, I loved you from the very start
I can think of many ways to say "I love you"
And with those many ways, there comes a time
For me to say I'll put no girl before you
So pretty lady, make up your mind
I saw you 'round my way and I had to meet you
But I've got to let you know I'm just somebody
Who wants to care for you with lots of love and patience
So please understand why I'm taking my time
I'm falling deeper and deeper and deeper, yeah, baby
And I'm so glad we had this conversation
Because girl, when it comes to you, there's no confusion
And I can't get it in your head and I'm having a fit
I can think of many ways to say "I love you"
And with those many ways, there comes a time
For me to say I'll put no girl before you
So pretty lady, make up your mind
Young lady 
I miss you in my life
I'm on a mission just to please you right
Sweet lady 
The thought of no you cuts just like a knife
Cuts like a knife
Girl, I've learned my lesson
No, we can't let others in
Misery loves some company
They don't see it's from within
It's you for me and me for you
But first we must be friends
I'll keep my love coming and coming and coming
Girl, we can win
I can think of many ways to say "I love you"
And with those many ways, there comes a time
For me to say I'll put no girl before you
So pretty lady, make up your mind
Girl, I've learned my lesson
No, we can't let others in
Misery loves some company
They don't see it's from within

It's you for me and me for you...Hug me, baby
I am here, so lonelyF there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you, yeah
Baby, I've been making plans of love
Baby, I've been making plans for you, yeah
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you
My sincerest apologies, I mean it
I'll admit it, all being pathetic
I'm in my late 20s still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try to get me, cause I'ma need to sail
Cause I'm selfish and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat but don't wanna see you on sale
Cause I failed and see you bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day, I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more
I'm wrong
But I'm promisin' you better though
And your friends sayin' let him go
And we ain't gettin' any younger
I can give up now but I can promise you forever though
(realest shit I ever wrote?
I’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I probably be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques but still I got the flaws
Brush you off, yeah I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of Move On's
I'M DARK, GOOD NIGGA, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady SHIT got too dark
I'M SORRY. And I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married to, you solo I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, ON flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions
But, I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though1. Can't Stop Won't Stop

We're truly touching 
One day I'll meet that special girl
Just for me
She'll have open ears
She won't ignore me
I'll bet I'll meet some special girl
She'll save the day
And she'll get it 
When I say girl

When it comes to you
Than those sweet lies

I heard it a million times, baby
Don't you lie to me, baby

Don't you lie, don't you lie to me baby 
WoahhhhIt's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye
Is there a reason why our love could not last?
I ask, was it too strong for you to hold on, pretty lady?
I thought we had a master plan
But it takes a stronger man to walk away
Than to watch our love fade away
I often wonder how and why
I did not cheat, I did not lie
I hope you know how hard I tried
But it's over for now, it's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye
I can't believe how suddenly things change
Yesterday, we were in love but all I feel were heartaches and pain
Day and night, I tried deep inside to work things out
But in my heart, I knew I still had my doubts
I thought we made a symphony
It's over now, no more harmony
I prayed so hard for love to fly
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye
Sorry I gotta leave
Baby, I'm begging, please

Try to learn where my thoughts could be, and how I stack figures
Learn why im real, s till that nigga

I hit dimes what i need with a 9
Before y'all judge me be clear
We got nothing but heat here

Party, Diddy, Usher, game is thru

La la la ghetto girls, la la la suburban girls, la la la international girls
U smell me
Had to take the time, to open up yo mind
Its exactly what u are... OPEN
U got the mesmerizing grind
Your shape should be a crime
Damn baby your a star
Mish momkin Can’t even look her in the face
Too busy staring at her waist line 
And I ain’t too proud to chase
Knowing the chances are, she’ll take mine
Behind the smile and the laughter
There’s danger, I know 
I know I’ll end up her capture
Caught in the rapture
But I won’t let go
Oh, why, mi amor?
What you doing take my heart for?
Why, mi amor?
You took it knowing that it’s not yours
Why, mi amor?
You caught me from the door, whoa
So tell me why, mi amor?
You’re so easy to adore
Left my heart on the floor
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Why, mi amor?
What you doing take my heart for?
Why, mi amor?
You took my heart on the floor
Behind the smile and the laughter
There’s danger, I know
I know I’ll end up her capture
Caught in a rapture
But I won’t let go
Woah, why, mi amor?
What you doing take my heart for?
Why, mi amor?
You took it knowing that it’s not yours
Why, mi amor?
You caught me from the door, whoa
So tell me why, mi amor?
You’re so easy to adore?
Left my heart on the floor{"Sticks and stone may break your bones
But talk can't do you no harm
Now listen to this one good"}
Yo I sit back, and watch most of ya'll slip
Attack every track like He-man's whip
Keep my shit tight, like them drums on D&D
You must be deaf, dumb, and blind if you slept on NAB
The beats about to blow yo, like TNT
Or your hoe after the show cause she's in to me
Got a beat like Nomar, dick like a crowbar
Haven't found a hole to pass seed erupt so-far
I'm in a court like arenas with no domes
Your fans get off the bus, I make them go home
Your girls a whore, I gave her counterfeit bills
The sound of it kills; I'll pound her clit with my dills
Sick with the skills, feel the name like Phil Da Ag
Do shows weekly, I'm on your bill to brag
Rather thrill a hag than ever feel a fag
Moby Mag is a crustified Chromag
See me throws jabs at your vocab
While your girl circulates around my motherfuckin gonad's
I'm so bad and yo the bitch don't know that
She's strung-out on Prozac and loves Mr. Bozak
To face the place with an abrasive hum
Watch me smack 'em in the face, they just a waste of cum
Ah fuck it, yo, I shouldn't even kick the rest dude
Talk about your moms and you think of a test tube
 x 2
The Porn Theatre Ushers don't care
See, we just tear
And pull rappers out the atmosphere
Listen to the style that I'm flappin' this year
Make the party people say oh yeah 
Who wanna talk fame, and waste my time?
Kid I'll rip you on a wall, on the floor, or in a rhyme
Like any time, any place, any race, any face, any beat... at any pace ya'll
Give me this mic and then my flowin' starts
See these rappers fall off, end up like Owen Hart
I'm throwin' darts.. and fuckin' mic's at your podium
Yo, you didn't know you'll get slimed like Nickelodeon
Sodium man AKA the naturally
Artistic, born original, fuckin' reality
They'll laugh at you as I come after you to master you
Dressed another, my fuckin style starts smackin' you
Hackin' you, 'till your left with half a crew
I'm laughin' at you, you're drunk off half a brew
Half of you front large with fragile cocks
And you talk more trash than the heap from Fragle Rock
See these dips often laugh at your penile
Pussy thought a rap room was a place to freestyle
Ya'll must be senile thinkin' ya'll can F with this
Nabo Rawk will make you my bitch receptionist
It like Rick Sanders as you step to this
Back off while I kick my fuckin' rep to this
 x 2
The Porn Theatre Ushers don't care
See, we just tear
And pull rappers out the atmosphere
Listen to the style that I'm flappin' this year

I ain't sayin you wrong for doin it how you do it, fellas
But its something different
Sing it ladies, listen
I see you standin here lookin real nice
I bet I know whats going through your mind
You probably thinkin that every man in here
Is lookin for somebody for one night
Your friends drug you out cause you ain't wanna come
Thats why youre standin there actin stuck up
Holdin up the wall, you got a misconception of men
Thinkin were all the same, full of games
All because you ended up with the wrong one
I bet you think that chivalry is gone
Cause you ain't seen nothing like it in so long
Its when you open her door, walk on one side of her
You give her your coat when its cold outside
A man ain't a man until hes man to his woman
Compliments and flowers really lets her know that you want her
Let me spell it out C H I V A L R Y
Girl, if you feel like chivalry is gone girl, Ima change your mind
Your probably like, why did I pick you
Well, Im over there, you L double okay at me like, ooh
And I was wonderin whats your N A M E
How you gon A C T when I C O M E over and ask you what it do?
And her reply was S O double R Y
Thanks for the compliment
But I gotta let you know Im probably not your type
You got a misconception of me, listen and Ill make you see
Dont let one B A D a double P L E spoil it for the bunch
I bet you think that chivalry is gone
Cause you ain't seen nothing like it in so long
Its when you open her door, walk on one side of her
You give her your coat when its cold outside
A man ain't a man until hes man to his woman
Compliments and flowers really lets her know that you want her
Let me spell it out C H I V A L R Y
Girl, if you feel like chivalry is gone girl, Ima change your mind
Now this ain't for everybody man
So dont get twisted on what Im sayin
If you wit somebody right now
But you feel that they playin
Then I know that you understand
How it feel when you talk for hours
Show up at the door wit some flowers
When you put a lil extra in it
Man it give you just a lil more power
Most of us go the extra mile
To get what even though it ain't our style
The stuff Im talkin most ain't seen
Or heard since they was just a lil' child
Im tryna show you how to really get her on
Im tryna show you how to really get her home
Im tryna show you how to have shorty mind
All messed up in the zone, just tell her I
I bet you think that chivalry is gone
Cause you ain't seen nothing like it in so long
Its when you open her door, walk on one side of her
You give her your coat when its cold outside
A man ain't a man until hes man to his woman
Compliments and flowers really lets her know that you want her
Let me spell it out C H I V A L R Y
Girl, if you feel like chivalry is gone girl, Ima change your mindThe fifth principle is imagination
The imagination is literally workshop
Where in are fashioned all plans created by man
The impulse, the desire is given shape, form and action through the aid
Of the imaginitive faculty of the mind
It has been said that man can create anything he can imagine
Kids call me Abdulla, cause I'm the butcher
Preppin' mc's inside my pressure cooker
Throughout the underground I've been known to boast
Enough to flip sewer caps, from coast to coast
I most - enjoy leaving energy depleted
Cause I often excel at being conceited
A brain is something that I know you need
See, I looked inside your dome, and found tumbleweed
In honor of me, the Nabo, they build chapels
For making heads bob, like teeth on apples
We all heard you hit it, missed like shootin bricks
Son, my beats are hype so I don't need a remix
Porn Theatre Ushers, we're oozing pestilence
Me plus this beat equals pure excellence
Humans hear my style and praise it, cause when I say it
I display it like archaic mosaics
Your total life expectancy against me
Is about three seconds
Before I beckon the weapon of my choice
Which is mostly the voice
Although my tongue is like a lasso
To knock you out easily like Glass Joe and Don Flamenco
I beat you in submission like my name was Dean Malenko
-I didn't know you were that good 
-It's easy, just test me. You'll see
Up up, down down, left right, left right
B-A-B-A start select me sixty lives in check
I'll cut your ear off, and simply wear it around my neck
So even when you're dead you can still hear the intellect
I Nabo rocker mega supreme don't have to be in the sky
Just to make the stars scream
Rappers today, they're just a waste
So if the sun burns out, I'd be chosen to take its place
And shine throughout the rest of history
Just alone my gaze will cause muscular dystrophy
I often dropkick Valkyries off of balconies
And in my spare time I like to study alchemy
Removin' columns of your spinal
With volumes of my vinyl
So now you walk to my way kid that's final
Steppin' to me is like killin' an albatross
I rip your ligaments and apply them as dental floss
-I didn't know you were that good 
-You are really listening aren't you? Yes!
I'll be the first to verse and curse the whole universe
I downed the Milky Way, cuz I hungered for the thirst
After all, haven't y'all heard of me?
I'm the famed mc, who shotput mercury
The globetrotter with a flyswatter
Dramatical plain plotter who walks on water
The omen to the Roman empire
Stalkin' predators, puttin' chumps in my crossfire
I took a chance and walked through a portal
Came out the other side as hip-hop's immortal
I'm Nabo Rock, the first of my kind
And the only thing I fear is the power of my own mind
Many front as B-Boys, and act the hardest
But they can't break or name one graf artist
Your style SUCKS, claimin' you're terrific
Got dropped from your label like extra prolific
Your implements is impotent, insignificant
Couldn't battle, if in Creek in Michigan
So listen to the one applying discipline
Beause your soul lacks artistry and needs conditionin'
To walk in my path, and be my protege
One must have six heads and two vertebraes
Peace, this is my imagination
-Imagination is important here
-You can do thisThere's a long and winding road that we have traveled
And the prize that waits for all who will prevail
There's a place for those who stand up tall in battle
Up against all odds determined not to fail
And when the moment comes you know that you'll be ready
To push yourself beyond where you have gone before
So write your name beside the very best in history
And take a bow before the crowd and hear them roar
Anything you can do this is from me to you
Just keep dreamin' keep on dreamin'
And if you really believe in time
You will make your dreams come true
Just keep dreamin' don't stop dreamin'
'Cause no one else can live your dream but you
So you rise above each hurdle you encounter
Let no obstacle before you slow your speed
For you possess a will to win that burns intensely
And win you will yes this will be your creed
And when the moment comes you know that you'll be ready
To push yourself much harder than you have done before
So write your name beside the very best in history
And take a bow before the crowd and hear them roar
Anything you can do this is from me to you
Just keep dreamin' keep on dreamin'
And if you really believe in time
You will make your dreams come true
Just keep dreamin' don't stop dreamin'
'Cause no one else can live your dream but you
And in the end with no regret
And in the end with no regret
You're given your all and nothin' less
You're given your all and nothin 'less
You know you've been the best that you can be
You know you've been the best that you can be
No one can say you didn't try
No one can say you didn't try
Go on and wave your banner high
Go on and wave your banner high
And savor that sweet taste of victory
And savor that sweet taste of victory
Dreamin' keep on dreamin'
Dreamin 'keep on dreamin'
And if you really believe in time
You will make your dreams come true
You will make your dreams come true
Just keep dreamin' don't stop dreamin'
'Cause no one else can live your dream but you
'Cause no one else can live your dream but you
Just go ahead and live the dream
Anything in life can happen
If you give your best in all you do
If you give your best in all you do
Ain't no limit for those who want it
Ain't no limit for those who want it
Take a chance and let it all come true
Take a chance and let it all come true
Shake your fears and hold your head high
Shake your fears and hold your head high
You can make it if you really try
You can make it if you really try
'Cause no one else can live your dream but you
Dreamin' keep on dreamin'
And if you really believe in time
You will make your dreams come true
You will make your dreams come true
Just keep dreamin' keep on dreamin'
'Cause no one else can live your dream but youUsher

And I would learn
Learn to treat you right, yeah
So if you ask yourself
"Does he really love me?" 
"Will I be true
Throughout the time?" 
"Do I know how to take good care of you?"
The answer that I truly love you
Will pop right in your mind
Love was here, but now you're gone
Baby, please, please come home
Love was here, but now you're gone
Baby, please, just come back home
Come on home, come on home
If I've given you a reason, let me know
To make your leave, it must have been that I don't show
You love the way you need, so girl, I can't complain
Let's try to work it out, my heart's truly ashamed
So if you ask yourself
"Does he really love me?" 
"Will I be true
Throughout the time?"

The answer that I truly love you

You know you'll be coming back for more

Tryin' to get a little V-I
Keep it down on the low key
'Cause you know how it feels
I said shawty she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spittin' my ear
You would think that she knew me
So we decided to chill
Conversation got heavy
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow
Watch out!
Watch out!
She was sayin' "Come get me"
So I got up and followed her to the flooor
She said "Baby let's go"
When I told her I said
Yeah yeah, shawty got down and said come and get me
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
She's all up in my head now
Got me thinking that it might be a good idea
To take her with me, 
'Cause she's ready to leave 
Now I gotta keep it real now
'Cause on a 1-to-10
She's a certified 20
But that just ain't me, hey
'Cause I don't know if I take that chance
Just where is it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Makes shorty all right with me

In the club lookin' so conspicuous
And Rowl! These women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow
Forget about the game, I'm a spit the truth
I won't stop till I get 'em in they birthday suits
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting then I put 'em on foot patrol
How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please
Ludacris feel cups like double D's
Me and Ursh once more and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say
Yeah yeah, shawty got down and said come and get me
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming

It was lust
Too bad I had to learn a lesson
They're against me
You were with me
But you never let your old thang go
I don't care to know why
Girl I guess some things
Can't be explained
It is what it is 
I don't know what to call it
'Cause I'm feelin' something else 
It is what it is 
Just don't let yourself get caught up 
When it's really something else
Know that is okay
Felt something going on
For every time that I thought it 
Girl I bet that's what it was
Called myself being down for you 
Just know that
Before I knew you I already knew you
How you get down 
But if that's your thang, babe
I ain't mad at you
It's cool
Just know I did it too

'Cause I'm feelin' something else 
It is what it is 
Just don't let yourself get caught up 
When it's really something else 
Take it to the bridge
I'm not saying that two wrongs can make it right
It ain't too late for us to try 
Do we put back together
Or we say goodbye? 
Give me another chance
You did it too, shit
It's all good, baby
We even, right?

Just to be part of the scenery
With all the lonely people there we are
Took a trip out to the galaxy
I'm not looking for salvation
Just a taste of liberation

Like to sit all day
And watch the stars bend

I know that it's lonely there where you are
If everything's so perfect tell me why you're hurting
It won't be long
Took a trip out to the girly show
It was there I talked to Jesus
He said Christ don't you believe it, no, no
Another drink and we talked all night
I asked does it hurt to be you
He said boy it hurts like hell
He said, my friends
Like to sit all day
And watch the stars bend

Just can't hide that I'm feeling free
'Cause all of the tender love you've given me
Yeah
All the tender love you've given to meGirl, I understand why
See, it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this is coming to an end
And it's better for me to let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn
It's gonna burn for me to say this, but it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming, but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting, baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Sending pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feeling ain't the same
Find myself calling her your name
Ladies, tell me, do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now to get my shorty back?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burning 'til you return 
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn 
Let it burn , gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, ooh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burning 'til you return 
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn , let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn 
Let it burn, gotta let it burnSay, "Yeah"
Yeah, shake it up, yo
Ladies, are you with me?
Fellas, are you with me?
Ooh
Say, "Yeah"
"Yeah!"
Say, "Yeah"
"Yeah!"
Say, "Yeah"
"Yeah!"
Shake it up, yo, yo
I do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say, "Oooh, oooh
Why is he so fly-I-I?"
She beeps me
Ever since she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
Yo, scream!
My way , my way 
You can't satisfy her needs 
She keeps running back to see me do it 
My way , my way 
What I say, goes 
And I'm in control 
Badass, señoritas, two-seaters with kicks
New kicks, all in the mix
I don't turn no tricks, they turn for me
Catching bricks don't concern me
So forget it, little midget
My mind on seven digits
Before I pay Heaven skies a visit, now dig it
I'm pulling all stops, locking down all spots
Saying "You, can't, front"
So, from this day forth, you know I'm all about heat
And what I do be the Major League
That's why your girlfriend's paging me
And she know like he know
You don't see her like I see her, so she's out the door
Shotgun in my drop, having fun
With the Don, system bassing, conversation
About how she been chasing me
And facing me, saying, "Give it to me"
Now scream!
My way , my way 
You can't satisfy her needs 
She keeps running back to see me do it 
My way , my way 
What I say, goes 
And I'm in control
Don't check me 
It was your girl who let me 
Take it this far, then, ooh wee! 
Let her have it every chance that she could get
What, you think you a baller?
I ain't gon' call her, clip that
You can get mad if you want to, say whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
Say it with me, c'mon!
My way , my way 
You can't satisfy her needs 
She keeps running back to see me do it 
My way , my way 
What I say, goes 
And I'm in controlTruth hurts
Yeah umm, see it's situations like this
That causes us players to get caught up
In, umm the truth, yeah
What you doin', where you been?
I paged you and you ain't hit me back
And I been callin' and I know
You seen my number on that caller ID, just listen to the words
I got reasons to believe that you've been foolin' around
The way you feel, the past you lived
The, the things you did
It don't matter to me for what it's worth
Just don't lie to me
'Cause that ain't what I need right now
Baby everything we built on trust
You're tearin' it down
'Cause I know the truth hurts
Tell me the truth now

Where you been goin'
And how you been puttin' your thing down?

Whatever you was workin'
I hope that it was worth it baby
Truth hurts
I got reason to believe
That you've been foolin' around
Girl I'm really tryin' hard to understand
I wanna move on and put it in the past
'Cause you claim that you ain't doin' nothin'
Must be my insecurity
It's got the best of me right now
What I know I can't hold inside of me
It's gonna drive me insane
'Cause I know the truth hurts
Tell me the truth now
What cha been doin'
And who you been doin' it with?
Truth hurts
Where you been goin'
And how you been puttin' your thing down?
Truth hurts
Whatever you was workin'

Sing it with me now
I can't hold on
Now wait a minute, oh, listen baby
The truth is I got this here secret, I've been keeping from you baby
'Cause I know that you gonna tear up the place
Punch me in my face, pull the hot grits out

Going nowhere fast, we've reached the climax
Were together now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away

You keep saying we argue too much
We made a mess of what used to be lust
So why do I care, I care at all, at all, at all, at allWhen I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the walls

Sit back and ride, when I feel like driving
Nobody understands but you girl
I can always be myself with you girl, that's why I'm singing
Ooh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday

Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
That's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
Uh oh, that's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me now
Right now
Since you been in my life
When I'm away from you I hurry home, oh yea
You live in my mind
So I never feel like I'm alone, yeah
Sometimes I gotta go, where I don't feel like going
And when it gets too fast, and I feel like slowing down
No one understands but you
That's why I only see myself with you
Ooh I can't believe it

See the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down this may take a while
See this girl, she sorta looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you
You remind of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things that she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
Thought that she was the one for me
Til I found out she was on her creep
Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me
This is why we could never be
You remind of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things that she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
I know it's so unfair to you
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me, whoa...
You remind of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things that she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
You remind of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things that she put me through
This is why I just can't get with youJust like me, just like me
Just like me, just like me
Yo, uh, what, what
You got it going on
What, what
Lemme hear you say, "Yeah"
"Yeah!"
Say, "Yeah"
"Yeah!"
Yo, say, "I came to par-tay"
"I came to par-tay"
Yo, say, "We came to par-tay"
"We came to par-tay"
All the ladies say, "Just like me"
"Just like me"
"Just like me"
"Just like me"
"Just like me"

All my homeboys say, "Just like me"

Say, "Just like me"
"Just like me"
Now everybody say, "Just like me"
"Just like me"
You're the kind of girl that makes
Everybody feel that you're just so damn good
But your secrets, I've found out
So don't deny what you're about
I know the truth
You know I do, I do 'cause
I know you get lonely 
And you want it 
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me
I know you get lonely 
And you want it 
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me
Quiet is kept you cry for help
When no one else is there, I know you're touching yourself
I know it feel good
Late night calls, I bet you do it all
Anything to get it off
But you still persist to front on me
Baby, tell me
Why do we play this game of chase 
When we know we both feel the same way? 
And why do you put me through all these changes

But it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting, baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't jumping like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Sending pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feeling ain't the same
Find myself calling her your name
Ladies, tell me do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back?
Oh oh oh oh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burning till you return 
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't jumping like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burning till you return 
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't jumping like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn

Https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f6/Usher-Confessions.jpgIf you live for something, you’re not alone, my friend
So fill up your cup and, lift your lighter, a toast to life
Luda!
They say what don’t kill me, can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
Cause why tip toe through life, to arrive safely at death
I’m on a journey, yeah, i’m on a roll
Sometimes gotta close my eyes, just to open my soul
And tonight is the night, I gotta feeling that i’m about act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and usher are about to break some rules
That’s somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for all, and yes i’m not here to fall
But for what it’s worth i’m ready to pay for the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
If I got one life to live, i’mma party til i’m dead
What the hell is a life worth living if it’s not on the edge
Tryna keep my balance i’m twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say “women, weed, and alcohol”
That’s somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can’t afford
But for what it’s worth i’m ready to pay for the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
If you live for something, you’re not alone, my friend
So fill up your cup, lift your lighters, and toast to life
I’m stuck in this moment, free the hands of my time
Cause I feel inner peace when i’m outta my mind
And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice
So i’m willing to bet that i’mma be crazy for the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life…You S H E are
You S H E are
Check it, it was like six of us
Three in the Benz, three in the truck
On eighty-five headed to the plush
Ten minutes later is when we pulled up
I parked the Benz, hit the alarm, glanced down at my rims
Tucked in my pant leg in the tongue of my Timbs
Hand in my shirt 'til we feel the gin, proceeded to walk in
Just then I saw this, magnificient misses sippin' on a glass of Cris'
With a couple of her friends giggling, I knew
You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl
Said I know you got a few with you
Don't even trip, I got my crew here too
Can ya grill what ya wanna do?
I really wanna chill with you
Tell your friends they can hop in the truck
We'll take the Benz but if we split up
Maybe we can hook up again
You never know I guess that all depends
If I can get you from the floor to the door of my 6-0-0
2-0 momos on low pros
So finish that Mo', get your coat
Tell your girls "Come on, let's go" 'cuz you are
You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl
You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl
You S H E are
Say it
You S H E are
One, three
You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl
You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl
You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl

If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl

You S H E are

One, threeI was never one to get the voodoo and the games out
Back then but I’m different, I’m insane now
First you blew my mind and then you blew my fucking brains out
Oh, oh, I’m insane now
I've never loved anybody like I love you
But then  I’ve never hated anybody’s bloody guts too
Like I detest yours, and it leads me to all my wrong moves
Cause you kill me, you hurt me, but  I love you
I hate you I love you I love you
I hate you I love you I love you
I hate you I love you and I love you
Don’t tell me how we’re special and there’s nothing like us
Because we’re crazy, we’re messed up & we’re psycho’s
And every time I wanna run away & clean my life up
I get homesick for our sweet never-ending cycle
Just like a drugtrip when you’re dazed out & your faded
Is the feeling that we tend to give each other on the daily
But when the high’s gone, and damn man, it never stays long;
Is when we go back to I hate you & you hate me
I hate you I love you I love you
I hate you I love you I love you
I hate you I love you I love you
I hate you I love you I love you
Oh honey, look at us; now we’re criminals
Violating every of law love, falling in and out of love, so much
We don’t  the meaning of it anymore
Hmm, baby look at us
What have we become now, can’t believe we turned out
In a way that doesn’t put respect on my name,
makes my mama look at me in a way and I don’t even care nowadays; everybody thinks I’m insane anyway
I hate you I love you I love you
I hate you I love you I love you
I hate you I love you I love you
I hate you I love you I love you
I was never one to get the voodoo and the games out
Back then but I’m different, I’m insane now
First you blew my mind and then you blew my fucking brains out
Oh, oh, I’m insane nowYo, what y'all wanna do?
What y'all wanna do?
Yo, yo, yo
Really, what y'all wanna do?
See, around here, we're just too much
We could slow down and you still couldn't catch us
My town full of heavy-hitters, bread-getters
Real fly, unforgettable-type fellas
See, all I do is keep hitting them up
Getting them up, shaking your butt, nigga, what
Lil' Liberaci, can't nobody stop me
Always making moves, so you better watch me
Slide to the southside in my blue drop-top, 355
Keeping it live
When you wanna make them , you know what to do
Call me and my crew to the rescue
De-de-de-de-de
Captain So So Def
We rocks the party 'til there's no one left 
Turn your volume up a notch
And watch the ba-bomb, bump-bump-bump, speakers pop
You never missed your water 'til your well runs dry
I never missed my woman till she said goodbye
Now my heart's made a change
My whole world's rearrange
And I'm ready to give you what you deserved
Yo, scream!
Come back, come back
Lover, this is where you belong 
In my arms, in my world 
Come back, come back
Lover, this is where you belong 
In my life, as my girl 
The grass is greener on the other side
We take people for granted 'til they're out of sight
I don't think that you know how much I'm going through
I don't think that you know how much I really love you, yeah
All I do, is think of you
See, I can't eat, can't sleep, baby it ain't hard to see all I do
All I do , is think of you
And you bump, diggy bump, bump, bump
Diggy, diggy, bump, bump, baby
Come backSomething ugly this way comes
Through my fingers sliding inside
All these blessings all these burns
I'm godless underneath your cover
Search for pleasure search for pain
In this world now I am undying
I unfurl my flag my nation helpless
Black black heart why would you offer more
Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy
I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core
I'm eating all your Kings and Queens
All your sex and your diamonds
As I begin to lose my grip
On these realities your sending
Taste your mind and taste your sex
I'm naked underneath your cover
Covers lie and we will bend and borrow
With the coming sign
The tide will take the sea will rise and time will rape
Black black heart why would you offer more
Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy
I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core
I'm eating all your Kings and Queens
All your sex and your diamonds
Black black heart why would you offer more
Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy
I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core
I'm eating all your Kings and Queens
All your sex and your diamonds
All your sex and your diamonds
All your sex and your diamonds
All your sex and your diamonds
All your sex and your diamondsThis past midnights I can't sleep
For thinking of you
To much space in this room
This KingSize was made for two
I’m looking out
Wish that on a star to get comeback in, in  too my heart staring out
Praying to the sky that you return, in, in to my life once again
Without you baby I feel incomplete
Enter my life once again
Let it go back to what it's use to be
Enter my life once again
Come in to my life, come in to my life
Girl come in to my life, ooh yeah
On sight I'm stuck, no showers
Don’t wanna rusch, away last touch
To the side every night
Fool you until the sun comes up
Standing looking up and wishing on a star that you comeback, in
In to my life staring up
Praying to the sky that you return again, in to my life
Without you baby I feel incomplete
In to my life
Let it get back to how it used to be
Come in to my life
I see the star shooting right through pass my room
When the wind when I drive, to reach for it, to get lost to you
And then I'am, out on my wish lists and everything and I mean again
I hope it's Comes true, yeah
Without you baby I feel incomplete
Enter my life, in to my life, yeah
Let it go back to what it's use to be
Enter my life once again
Come in to my life, come in to my life
Come in to my life again

Yo
I can't sleep at night, I toss and turn
Listening for the telephone
When I get your call, I'm all choked up
Can't believe you called my home
And as a matter of fact, it blows my mind
You would even talk to me
Because a girl like you is like a dream come true
A real life fantasy
No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, sing it
Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make , we'll be together
Every little step I take , you will be there 
Every little step I make , we'll be together

40 hoes for this dick I'm gon' swimming

Cuz me and Usher made this song
For this girl can be on my Rocket
The one I stick in the socket
Naw nigga she gone for the week
While me and Usher go on team fleet
Hey

Young ass girl that loves to bite
She knows that she loves me

And she know that I love her
And she loves me so cove her
We do it in the shower
On the counter
On the floor

What now, I think this woman's waiting for a...
What now, why I let her go and put that s** on me
What now, I pop this shit I watch that girl undress for me
Uh standing her perfume in the air
Got it feeling different in here, yeah
Yeah, she took my breath away
On to some fancy shit into another place
Such an expensive trip
But she didn't make me pay for it with my money
Chorus:
Oh, it's the sins of my father
He left a debt to his son
To pay the the girl who's a mother
Collect the one, let me run, no
But she didn't make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father
I'm praying I can reverse this curse
Oh, now she's speaking in a tongue that sounds new to me
Oh, momma tell me what this could do to me
Oh now, I wouldn't fall for something like this usually
No, no, no tell me how could I ever prepare
If my mother never was there
Oh, she took my breath away
On to some fancy ship
And to down the place... Such an expensive trip!
But she didn't make me pay for it with my money
Chorus:
Oh, is the sins of my father
He left a debt to his son
To pay the the girl who's a mother
Collect the one, let me run, no
But she didn't make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father
I'm praying I can reverse this curse
I don't deserve a debt that came with my birth
Oh, oh, oh, what happened...
Chorus:
Oh, is the sins of my father
He left a debt to his son
To pay the the girl who's a mother
Collect the one, let me run, no
But she didn't make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father
I'm praying I can reverse this curseHaha, yeah, ok!
Uh, Ready? Set, go!
Here comes the A-Train, Mr.Fleet Feet
Savin' lives, no surprise like it's easy
There ain't no day like a race day
A-Train on the track like a raceway 
I'm the best to ever do it, y'all crazy
Make way or you're pushing up daises 
Bring the heat, now they're beggin' for some AC
Only place I ever lose in your daydreams
Too quick for a flick, too swift for em' 
Hear a click, see em' burn when I get going
Bluе streak in the street nevеr tip-toeing
A-Train super sauna with the shit like
Woah, get off the road lightning got nothin' on me when I bolt
Y'all shoot with shots but your bullets too slow
I'm on the road, straight to the dough
Faster than the speed of light
Watching as your dreams take flight
I think I should stand and fight
Then disappear into the night
Faster than the speed of light
Watching as your dreams take flight
I think I should stand and fight
Then disappear into the night
Into the night
Yeah, ain't no after you can get that action no
Takin' back what's my life the à la mode
Baby tryna play me like a saxophone
Who ain't though? I've cracked the code
Slaying lanes and ripping roads
Y'all will never touch me like I asked em' to
Presto! Yeah I'm gone in a flash
Start off soon, go and get me cash
Leave em' in the dust when I dash
You can kiss my butt when I pass, gas to your mustache
A-Train second to none
If you're looking for the greatest I'm the definition
It ain't fair when I play you when I'm competition
I'm the king who holds the crown with no opposition
I'm a do it all my way 
Picking up the pace, I want loves not made 
Putting in the work, lie awake 
Slipstream wave kicking off my way
I'm outta of here
Faster than the speed of light 
Watching as your dreams take flight 
I think I should stand and fight
Then disappear into the night
Faster than the speed of light
Watching as your dreams take flight
I think I should stand and fight
Then disappear into the night
And I'm goneYo, B-Boys make some noise!

A funny thing the part we can't play
I'd love to offer you with all the blame
But now we have to choose
Another round for all my friends and me
Another poke at sensibility
We've found out
Why are we floundering
I'm drowning in the reveler's sin
I've taken you up on your offerings
I don't even know it's good bye
You had to lose
Always knew that we weren't quite the same
I blew it up with everyone who ever knew me
Had to change
A revidescent light to shine the way
But we're not always following the same way out now
Why are we floundering
I'm drowning in the reveler's sin
I've taken you up on your offerings
I don't even know it's good bye
GoodbyeWhy?
Why?
Living on the edge, out of control
And the world just won't let me slow down
But in my biggest picture
Was a photo of you and me
Girl, you know I tried
I work hard to provide all the material things
That I thought would make you happy
I'm confused, can you make me understand?
'Cause I'm trying to give you the best of me
I thought we were cool, maybe I was blind
But never took time to see
Can you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you wanna leave
Baby, help me
Without you, my whole world is falling apart
And I'm going crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone
I need you to come back home
Girl, I put your love up on a shelf
And I guess I just left it to die
Now we're not together
'Cause I hurt you too many times
And now you're not around
I wish for every moment of time that got wasted
We used it to make sweet love
Baby, be my guide, please take my hand
Want you to know that I got you if you need it
Don't wanna be on the outside looking in
I gotta have you, girl, can't you see?
Will you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you wanna leave
Baby, help me
'Cause without you, my whole world is falling apart
And without you, I think I'll go crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone
I need you to come back home 
I don't wanna be alone
Please stay, don't go
I don't want it to be over
Give me another chance, I wanna be your man
Girl, you got me down here on my knees
Crying, begging, pleading, I'll do anything for your love
Would you help me?
Without you, my whole world is falling apart
And without you, girl, I'm going crazy
Life's a prison without your love
Can you help me?
Tell me why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Can you help me?
Help me understand, I can be your man
It's driving me crazy

We got them Georgia peaches so sweet that you want to bite them
And we got the hardest slang that bang from every city
Does anybody know how to make it rain?
We keep that carpet green in the city, the saddle in the traffic
You ever got a problem, homie? We make you feel unstopped
Oh, no, yes, sir
So when you see me in the club, partner this is how you greet me, throw it up
I can make it rain 24 stacks in the air
It's raining money in here, throw it up, ah, throw it up, ah
You gotta get it on the floor, short
Get it in on the floor, shorty
Get down on your knees
I'm trying to get you all alone
So you can feel the chrome up in my Chevy drop top
This the part where everybody throw up the A
Aye, what it do, shorty? Let me get that number, shorty
What you see in the A, we shoulder lean and snap, shorty
We keep the hottest fit, fresh to death
Come in the club like we never left
If you ain't with it, shorty, get gone
Does anybody know how to make it rain?
We keep that carpet green in the city, the saddle in the traffic
You ever got a problem, homie? We make you feel unstopped
Oh, no, yes, sir

Believe in truth believe in slavery but it's only the television kind
Believe that light will find a way
Believe in jets as they blow into the sky
Believe in you believe in me
And all of these things
Devil's by my side
And the freaks are out we're in force tonight
And you opened me wide
'Cause it's cold in there and it's warm outside
Believe that hate will never die
Believe in sex and love in a dangerous time
Believe in grace and your intelligence
Believe in exploring the corners of the mind
Believe your truth is not my truth
That God can exist with many faces at one time
Believe that we will find a way through all of these things
All of these things
Devil's by my side
And the freaks are out we're in force tonight
And you opened me wide
'Cause it's cold in there and it's warm outside
Hard when you realize that you'll never have what you're trying to find
Believe in hope believe in faith believe in things I can't fight
Believe that somewhere I've seen war but it's only the television kind
Devil's by my side
And the freaks are out we're in force tonight
And you opened me wide
'Cause it's cold in there and it's warm outside
It's hard when you realize that you'll never have what you're trying to find
Are you smiling now?
Let it go

MemoryIts like whatever I do
Just can't get through to you
Im never gonna tell you nothing wrong
Listen
Now, now she love me, shorty, I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found
I lost my way, she said shed stay
And lately I been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out
I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before the great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave but you lied to me when you said that
Baby, no worries, I promise to get us back
I know sorries, just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, Im trying to travel through
But its like moving mountains
Its like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
Then the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
Its like moving mountains
Its like moving mountains
Why you just leave me, just leave me be
Just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be
She, she dont touch me, I dont touch her
We ain't really ever say a word
I really wanna give her everything she deserves
But the bad took away the girl
She thinks that Im full of it, arguments
Always pissed, man Im tired
Every kiss that I miss
Girl you know Im trying
You never believe when I say
And I never believe it when you say
I love you, and I shouldn't complain about it
I should take it like a man and walk up out it
Cause we will never be the same
Ive been standing in gas
And you have been the flame
So I know sorry, just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, Im trying to get through
Gotta move this mountain
Its like moving mountains
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
Then the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
Its like moving mountains
Its like moving mountains
Well baby why you just leave me, just leave me be
Just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be
This must be a slow death that I'm traveling on
It feels so wrong, I'm barely holding on
See no matter what it takes, I've gotta get it together baby yeah
And these hills that I'm traveling up
She ain't showing me love, I'm down on my luck
Ooh, I'm done, oh
I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying, I'm trying my boo
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
Then the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
Its like moving a mountain
I'm trying to move this mountain
Well baby why you just leave me, just leave me be
Just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be, oh
Baby babyPretty baby don't be late
The world is ending I can't change
The way I feel about you now
New York is cold as ever
But still I go out every night
Hide myself among the lights
Bathe in all the pretty things the city brings
The bodies glisten and they shine
Like the stars we're born to die
Like these roses we all will fade
I'm counting the cars on the freeway below
Lost in the music all the foolishness of our lives
Speeding out of control
Lost in the music in the music
Pretty baby please don't cry
Wipe the guilt out from your eyes
And leave your conscience on the bed
There's no one innocent here
In the mirror you'll find faith
Plastic flowers never fade
But we all turn to grey
I'm counting the cars on the freeway below
Lost in the music all the foolishness of our lives
Speeding out of control
Lost in the music in the music
I lost my way
I lost it all
I lost my way
Pretty baby please don't cry
Wipe the guilt out from your eyes
Pick yourself up off the bed
There's no one innocent here
The bodies glisten and they shine
Like the stars we're born to die
Like these roses we all will fade
I'm counting the cars on the freeway below
Lost in the music all the foolishness of our lives
Speeding out of control
Lost in the music
I'm counting the cars on the freeway below
I'm counting the lights and the end of it all
I'm counting the cars on the freeway below
Lost in the music in the music
In the music in the music
In the music in the musicSalvation's on the way
I caught the last flight headed for outer space
My ticket's all arranged
And if I left you there
Well that was my mistake
Baby's got the blues
Think that I'll write it all down
There's nothing I could do
In order to save myself
I had to cut you loose
Race across the universe
That separates this space between us
All your ghosts are calling at the speed of light I cannot feel
All the ghosts are calling get no answer
Wake up and say goodbye
Lost you on the wind
And as those memories died still I can't let you in
We all start to fade
Somehow still radiate
Baby's got the blues
I tried to write it all down
There's nothing I could do
In order to save yourself
You had to cut me loose
Race across the universe
That separates this space between us
All your ghosts are calling at the speed of light I cannot feel
All the ghosts are calling get no answer
Wake up and say goodbye
Race across the universe
That separates this space between us
All your ghosts are calling at the speed of light I cannot feel
All the ghosts are calling get no answer
Wake up and say goodbye
Race across the universe
That separates this space between us
All your ghosts are calling at the speed of light I cannot feel
All the ghosts are calling get no answer
Wake up and say goodbye
Wake up and say goodbye
Wake up and say goodbye
)Sold myself out for a pocket of lies
Into the sea you threw us into the sea
Took yourself out on a holiday
Pay the way I always pay the way
Everybody wants it 9 to 5
Typical lies I said more typical lies
Only wanted to be by your side
You're making it hard to survive
And these airplanes
Flying in the fast lane
And they push on through
Yeah they push on through
It's killing me
The weight of your gravity
And we push on through
Yeah we push on through
Cliché Le Chez is just the name I use
Into the sea I threw us into the sea
Underwhelming just a game we play
Come on down you'll never be set free
Took myself out on a holiday
Pay the way I always pay the way
Only wanted to be by your side
You're making it hard to survive
And these airplanes
Flying in the fast lane
And they push on through
Yeah they push on through
It's killing me
The weight of your gravity
And we push on through
Yeah we push on through
And these airplanes
Flying in the fast lane
And they push on through
Yeah they push on through
It's killing me
The weight of your gravity

Yeah they push on through
It's killing me
The weight of your gravity
And we push on through
Yeah we push on through
These airplanes
Flying in the fast lane
And they push on through
Yeah they push on through
It's killing me
The weight of your gravity
And they push on through
Yeah they push on throughSmells on the air
See there, it's crushing
The final impression
The stains on the paper
Where words fell like water
Unearth all the changes
That never did matter
I think its beginning to freeze here
Caught in the rage
And the fire of things
All the brightness that burns me
I'm fumbling through
Like a child in the dark
When the nakedness comes
I am shocked by the colour
The glorious way your skin
Comes alive
And I never thought we'd make it back so soon
Might be nice
But I knew you'd be your own destroyer
Comes a time
And I always thought I'd make it up to you
Here, please forgive me
How could we escape
All the bitterness
Piled upon bitterness
Held in the face of the things
That I don't understand
Intellectualize
Over and over
This helplessness suits us
Funny how quiet
Has slipped to our corners
And worn all our edges away
You are watching
Breathing and baiting
Wanting and warming
And cautiously waiting
For some simple signal
To creep cross your conscience
Uncover redemption
And oh, did I mention?
I carried you down
To the St. Lawrence River
The banks running dirty
The water's beginning to freeze here
Solid by morning
And I'll freeze here
Winter by morning
Comes alive
And I never thought you'd get me back so soon
Might be nice
But its only if my own destroyer
Comes alive
And I always knew I'd make it up to you
I saw on your face
Such a curious grin
As I let go your hand
I was desperate to hold you again
But you're sinking
Too deep in the water
Outsmarted myself
And so easily gave up
What I wanted
Solid by morning
What I wanted
Winter by morning
Comes alive
And I never thought you'd make it up so soon
Might be nice
But I always knew you're my destroyer
Comes a time
And I always thought I'd make it up to you
Solid by morning
And I'll freeze here
Winter by morningWell I woke up last night in a technology haze
My eyes were all sparked
From this common malaise
So I found me a doctor who said he'd even me out
Take my highs and my lows
'Cause the colours were just too loud
And as the day becomes night
And we only want greys
And the innocence runs out
Well this is the price to pay
Mr Jangle what you gonna do when the Sun breaks down and the rain pours through
Tell me baby what you gonna do this time
Mr Jangle what you gonna do when the Sun breaks down and the rain pours through
Tell me baby what you gonna do this time
What you gonna do what you gonna do this time this time
What you gonna do what you gonna do this time this time
What you gonna do what you gonna do
You got caught on my teeth so I spit out my tongue
And I cut off these hands just to see if the feeling would come
And we drank 'til we drowned 'til we choked on the world
And we bathed in the beauty of all of you
Mr Jangle what you gonna do when the Sun breaks down and the rain pours through
Tell me baby what you gonna do this time
Mr Jangle what you gonna do when the Sun breaks down and the rain pours through
Tell me baby what you gonna do this time
What you gonna do what you gonna do this time this time
What you gonna do what you gonna do this time this time
What you gonna do what you gonna do
Well I woke up last night just outside of myself
Skin hair bone broke down cell by single cell
And I could not believe I had died in my sleep
Just drowned in the beauty of all of youLive hate
Blind faith
Breathe deep
Takes me
We hold fast
Won't last
The night falls
It's just it's just as well
And if we danced all night
Fell so deep
If we could live to tell what our eyes have seen
We are wolves here
And so I held you tight
Dared to confess
So you can feel my body steal each breathe
We are wolves here
Taste the electricity
City unwinds 'til we believe
And joy has left
Burns until it's dead
And if we danced all night
Fell so deep
If we could live to tell what our eyes have seen
We are wolves here
And so I held you tight
Dared to confess
So you can feel my body steal each breathe
We are wolves here
Live hate
Blind faith
And joy has left
Burns until it's dead
And if we danced all night
Fell so deep
If we could live to tell what our eyes have seen
We are wolves here
And so I held you tight
Dared to confess
So you can feel my body steal each breathe
We are wolves hereJust another afternoon
And I'm choking down tea for two
When you've flown so far away
And you know I'm waiting
When the consequence of rage
Comes crashing through the living room floor
When I thought I'd found a life
Seems I've been mistaken
So I take the paid holiday
But I just can't set foot on the plane
Well your voice gets in the way
Guess I'll drive cross country
I, I see you fall
I see you fall
I've never seen you look so beautiful
And I, I see you fall
I see you fall
I've never seen you look so beautiful
Well my suits been pressed and cleaned
And I've never seen you people before
Well I wander through the town
And we sing our sad songs
As I lower you into the ground
Well you've never seen these people before
With the bullets falling all around
And they sing their sad songs
I, I see you fall
I see you fall
I've never seen you look so beautiful
And I, I see you fall
I see you fall
I've never seen you look so beautiful
I just keep moving
I see you watching
I see you waving from the window
And I think I'm falling
Just keep driving
There is nothing to forgive now
And I, I see you fall
I see you fall
I've never seen you look so beautiful
And I, I see you fall
I see you fall
I've never seen you look so beautiful
Hold on hold on
Hold on hold on
Hold on hold on
Hold on hold onI am just the grey one
I'm the darker side of you
And there's a space you left inside me
I hope it will amuse
And see this sign carved in my arm
Just means I'll hate you all forever
It's my babyskin tattoo
It's all the brand name that you've left
It's not so far from me to you
It's not so far from me to you
It's not so far from me to you
It's not so far
Circumcised myself
Because I knew you'd be too busy
And I saw the knife was dull
Just why the fuck do you think I'm crying
Styes caught in my eye
And it swells me 'til I'm numbing
But i'll leave it here to punish you
For leaving me so hard
It's not so far from me to you
It's not so far from me to you
It's not so far from me to you
It's not so far
I deliver
I will receive
All the blessings from these things given
Tested longer
Held back only here
I am just the grey one
I'm the darker side of you
And there's a place you left inside me
I hope it will amuse
And see this sign carved in my arm
Just means I'll hate you all forever
It's my babyskin tattoo
It's all the brand name that you've left me
And I beg, borrow, prostrate here
Under cover of everything made dear
Fearing only
Fearing only youOperator, operator
I’ve been calling you for hours
But my signal’s getting weak
So I’m turning these lights down
I’ve been circling the planet
At a million miles an hour
And I thought I saw a flash
A billion neon sounds went out
Operator, operator
Won’t you please, give me a sign?
Am I watching the world unwind?
Had you for one day, fit for a thousand years
I just keep playing this scene over in my mind
I know that I’m just a prisoner here
I’ll just keep playing this scene over and rewind
Operator, take a message
At the guards are all in fire
And they’re slipping out the back door
With more leaving every hour
And all the streets we walked on
And everyone we loved
Gone like ash on the morning air
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I’m just starring at the sun
Are we watching the world undone?
Had you for one day, fit for a thousand years
I just keep playing this scene over in my mind
I know that I’m just a prisoner here
I’ll just keep playing this scene over and rewind
I’ve been drawn by the sun
And I am being drawn by the sun
Operator, operator
I’ve been calling you for hours
And I thought I saw a flash, billion voices just went out
And all the streets we walked on
And everyone we loved
Gone like ash on the morning air
Had you for one day, fit for a thousand years
I just keep playing this scene over in my mind
I know that I’m just a prisoner here
I’ll just keep playing this scene over and rewindI'm the Trickster, burn so brightly
I still hate you, motherfuckers everyone
Wrapped in glory, bound so tightly
I still need you even when I'm overcome
Saved
By the light
Let me go on
Let me go bright
To be saved
By the light
Let me go on
Let me go bright
I'm the Trickster, burnt so badly
I still hate you, motherfuckers everyone
Wore my sickness so politely
I can be your everything to everyone
Void of meaning, swelled just slightly
I still need you, I still need you
Gone forever so concisely
I still need you, I still need you
Saved
By the light
Let me go on
Let me go bright
To be saved
By the light
Let me go on
Let me go bright
And if you hate the world
Let's say I've been there
And if you hate yourself
Well don't go changing
All the times I used your body
Done my way, can't say I'm sorry
Ripped the gloss off all your memories
Consequences so demanding
Bruised and beaten, conscience bleeding
Sexually, sexually, sexually
Saved
By the light
Let me go on
Let me go bright
To be saved
By the light
Let me go on
Let me go bright
And I'm saved
By the light
Let me go on
Let me go bright
Let me go brightYou came apart on me last Sunday morning
Choked and indicted by the truth
And it's always tough when there's never enough
Of the good things coming
And there was never enough for you
There was never enough for you
Butterfly
Where you gone
I can't see you anymore
My eyes are taken still too high
Came down naked on you
Butterfly
Where you gone
I can't feel you any more
I can't feel you any more
Got excited when I thought that we would last
Twisted inside out 'til we were drowning
From the first attack we could never go back so we just keep on coming
But I was never enough for you
Was there ever enough for you
Butterfly
Where you gone
I can't feel you anymore
My eyes are taken still too high
Came down naked on you
Butterfly
Where you gone
I can't feel you anymore
I can't feel you anymore
And if you think you're dying
Baby well you know I felt the same
'Cause we were only hoping
Why's it always feel like feel like
It feels like rain
Butterfly
Where you gone
I can't see you anymore
My eyes are taken still too high
Came down naked on you
Butterfly
Where you gone
I can't feel you any more
I can't feel you any more
I can't feel you any more
I can't feel you any moreTurn me out then turn me on
Pretty flower can you tell me what's become of who we are
Only asking what you'd like tonight
We'll take America
Just shake my tits and ass yeah well go far
And if we wanted more
Then that was only what we thought our right was
Only wanted more but we were always blinded
Here we want to try
But I can try to be as plain as daylight
Looking to the world
But we were always blinded
Sell a little bit to you
A circus sideshow but the makeup's shining through it's not so bad
Is there anyone to know
Forget my politics just sex me 'til I'm done it's not so hard
And if we wanted more
Then that was only what we thought our right was
Only wanted more but we were always blinded
Here we want to try
But I can try to be as plain as daylight
Looking to the world
But we were always blinded
And all the stars are out for you
And everybody's hiding here
And all the stars have come unglued
But everybody everybody's changing
We're changing we're changing we're changing
And if we wanted more
Then that was only what we thought our right was
Only wanted more but we were always blinded
Here we want to try
But I can try to be as plain as daylight
Looking to the world
But we were always blinded
Always blinded
And all the stars are out for you
And everybody's hiding here
And all the stars have come unglued
But everybody everybody's changing
We're changing we're changing we're changingSomething ugly this way comes
Through my fingers sliding inside
All these blessings all these burns
I'm godless underneath your cover
Search for pleasure search for pain
In this world now I am undying
I unfurl my flag my nation helpless
Black black heart why would you offer more
Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy
I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core
I'm eating all your Kings and Queens
All your sex and your diamonds
As I begin to lose my grip
On these realities your sending
Taste your mind and taste your sex
I'm naked underneath your cover
Covers lie and we will bend and borrow
With the coming sign
The tide will take the sea will rise and time will rape
Black black heart why would you offer more
Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy
I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core
I'm eating all your Kings and Queens
All your sex and your diamonds
Black black heart why would you offer more
Why would you make it easier on me to satisfy
I'm on fire I'm rotting to the core
I'm eating all your Kings and Queens
All your sex and your diamonds
All your sex and your diamonds
All your sex and your diamonds
All your sex and your diamonds
All your sex and your diamondsCar crash East side of town
The water's deep here you can feel your own strength fading
You're beginning to let go
The bubbles rise as we go down
Underwater overwhelmed
Can't fight the current here it's starting to take hold
But high above me I can see the surface now
The picture perfect life is fading out of view
And high above me I can feel the world
But I don't need it I don't need it I don't need it
I just need you
I just need you
Then you grow colder like a dream
I can't believe the practical things
They're always out of reach
And I know you're not really here
These visions fly so quickly on the edge
They're starting to take hold
But high above me I can see the surface now
The picture perfect life is fading out of view
And high above me I can feel the world
But I don't need it I don't need it I don't need it
Won't you help me with this loneliness
'Cause I don't know what's wrong or right
Underneath the truth
Won't you help me with this bitterness
'Cause I can't seem to walk outside
Car crash East side of town
The water's deep here I can feel my own strength fading
I'm beginning to let go
The bubbles rise as I go down
Underwater overwhelmed
Can't fight the current here it's starting to take hold
But high above me I can see the surface now
The picture perfect life is fading out of view
And high above me I can feel the world
But I don't need it I don't need it I don't need it
I don't need it I don't need it I don't need it
I don't need it I don't need it I don't need it
I just need you
I just need you
I just need you
I just need youHeaven and earth coming down
We watched them fall
Angels are gathering 'round
No one talks
We'll be alright, time 's on our side
Angels are gathering 'round
Tonight, we'll sparkle and shine
Bury me deep in the ground, cover my eyes
Dreamt we were killed from the fall
We never died
You'll be alright, I'm by your side
Friends are all gathering 'round
Tonight. . . we'll sparkle and shine!
It comes to us all
We'll never know why
It comes to us all
In the end
Heaven and earth coming down
We watched them fall
Dreamt I was there in your arms
But we don't talk
You'll be alright, time 's on your side
Angels are gathering 'round
Tonight, we'll sparkle and shineThe future teaches you to be alone
The present to be afraid and cold
So if I can shoot rabbits
Then I can shoot fascists
Bullets for your brain today
But we'll forget it all again
Monuments put from pen to paper
Turns me into a gutless wonder
And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
Will be next, will be next, will be next
Gravity keeps my head down
Or is it maybe shame
At being so young
And being so vain
Holes in your head today
But I'm a pacifist
I've walked Las Ramblas
But not with real intent
And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
Will be next, will be next, will be next
And on the street tonight an old man plays
With newspaper cuttings of his glory days
If you tolerate this then your children will be next
If you tolerate this then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
Will be next, will be next, will be next
And on the street tonight an old man plays
With newspaper cuttings of his glory daysBreathe blood is in the water
Hold on tight I'm coming
I'll be there soon
Keep your eyes high on the horizon
All the clouds are falling
Between me and you
And you've grown so cold
Too numb to notice
That the sky has turned so blue
Fight even underwater
Struggle makes it harder
There's nothing left to do
Don't close your eyes even for a moment
Even for one second
I'll be there soon
And we close our eyes
Too numb to notice
That the sky has turned so blue
And we close our eyes
Too numb to notice
That the sky has turned so blue

        Ah, ah, ah, ah
You know I want you in the worst way
But you don't make it too easy
It ain't a game if you don't play, nah
If touching is a feeling, seeing is believin'
Baby if you heard it, let me be your muse
If touching is a feeling, let me know your willing
The limit ain't the ceiling, we don't need a reason to go off
If touching is a feeling, seeing is believin'
Baby if you heard it, let me be your muse
If touching is a feeling, let me know your willing
The limit ain't the ceiling, we don't need a reason to go off
Go off
Go off
To go off
Go off
Touching is a feeling, seeing is believin'
Baby if you heard it, let me be your muse
If touching is a feeling, let me know your willing
The limit ain't the ceiling, we don't need a reason to go off
If touching is a feeling, seeing is believin'
Baby if you heard it, let me be your muse
If touching is a feeling, let me know your willing
The limit ain't the ceiling, we don't need a reason to go off
If touching is a feeling, seeing is believin'
Baby if you heard it, let me be your muse
If touching is a feeling, let me know your willing
The limit ain't the ceiling, we don't need a reason to go off
Go off
To go off
Go off
If touching is a feeling, seeing is believin
Baby if you heard it, let me be your muse
If touching is a feeling, let me know your willing
The limit ain't the ceiling, we don't need a reason to go off
If touching is a feeling, seeing is believin
Baby if you heard it, let me be your muse
If touching is a feeling, let me know your willing
