Done with the perkys
I don't even feel like it's working
I was playing the bench, I was lurking
On the block where they plotting on murking
You don't even know I was hurting
I was fucked up, a bitch had me hurting
And I think she did it on purpose
I can't fuck with the hate, I'm allergic
I feel like they had me on standby
See the pain in my damn eyes
I got out of jail and my mans died
I never sleep, I'm a vampire
I'm not a regular person
I can't be giving out verses
I'm making the industry nervous
I'm still working through all the disturbance
I'm done with these Balenciagas
They keep on fucking my socks up
Nothing but foreigns behind us
We used to pull up in the Honda
Now every time that we pop up
We got to pull up in designer
We doing it just to remind us
To never go back to the bottom
They started off hating on me
Everybody debating on me
A nigga wrote a statement on me
My life, they want to take it from me
So I got a .380 on me
It ain't never on safety, I be
Having all of this paper on me
I just hope you praying for me
I can tell you what happened
The streets turned me into a savage
I started off juggin' and trapping
Watch a couple a niggas get blasted
Way too much blood for a napkin
Won't nobody tell you what happened
I'm good when you see me in traffic
Automatic in the Benz 4matic
In the S550 I'm speeding
Nigga you wouldn't believe it
I came up from nothing I mean it
Now I'm living everything I was dreaming

You can try stealing my heart, it's already gone
You can tell something is wrong, just leave me alone
I don't even know where to start, I'm just done
Used to being in my room with you
Now you're gone, I only see you through the phone now, where did you go?
I should've never told you leave me alone, I guess you took it to the heart
Yeah, let's go
It's just me and this guitar, playing this song
You can try stealing my heart, it's already gone
You can tell something is wrong, just leave me alone
I don't even know where to start, I'm just done
Used to being in my room with you, now you're gone
Oh, I only see you through a phone now, where did you go?
I should've never told you, "Leave me alone"
I guess you took it to the heart when I said, "Leave me a—"
Sweat going down to my balls, I'm having withdrawals
It's crazy, baby, all of my scars shaped in hearts
Lamborghini Urus, Ferraris, extra cars
If you start bringing up love, I'm bringing my gun
I never knew I'd make it this far, it feels bizarre
But you know my energy large, like a Quran
And you know I work too hard, I came too far
I'm happy I'm still alive
'Cause half of my niggas they either died or in the system
Then if I ain't start rapping I swear to God I'd have been with them
I baguetteed out my watches, I'm a timeless ass nigga
I was creepin' on the low, yeah, I'm a doggy ass nigga
But I'm an honest nigga, I can only lie when it comes to snitchin'
I hold grudges with my bitches, if you lie I won't forgive you
Just don't go tell nobody about those times that I was with you
You got my shoulder to lean on if you want to cry, fuck a tissue
In and out of love so many fucking times, I don't get it
I could get on some gangsta shit, then turn the vibe sentimental
You say you front on my nigga and he ain't ride, wrong nigga
Swear it's way too many hoes that be dying over bitches 
Yeah, let's go
It's just me and this guitar, playing this song
You can try stealing my heart, it's already gone
You can tell something is wrong, just leave me alone
I don't even know where to start, I'm just done
Used to being in my room with you, now you're gone
Oh, I only see you through a phone now, where did you go?
I should've never told you, "Leave me alone"
I guess you took it to the heart when I said, "Leave me a—"
I lost her heart, she left me here with this guitar
So if you plan on stealing my heart, it's already gone
You can tell something is wrong, just leave me alone
'Cause I don't even know where to start, I'm just done
Used to being in my room with you, now you're gone
Oh, I only see you through a phone now, where did you go?And I feel like I'm

And girl, I don't even follow you, I can't
Too busy calling you back, sometimes I don't understand
But girl, I feel like I walk past you, flexed on you by accident
I hopped in a Bentley, I don't plan on crashing it
I told you that I love you baby, I was gassin' it
Gold blunts rolled up, I ain't mashing it
Before you was my baby baby you was just a friend
And know that I was just in the streets hustlin'
They threw me in the jungle so I started bussin' licks
I ran into a mic and then I said, "Fuck the shit"
They call me young Mike, 'bout to get the glove and shit
Two diamond rings yea I paid a dub for it
Throw subs at me bet I don't respond to it
I'm countin' up money while you niggas commenting
Stuck on your ex and I can get you over it
VVS on my neck, let's come and see how cold it get
Before I sent you that message I was on my thirtieth sip
I was drinking a Sunkist and then I put the dirty in it
And I swear, that's why I'm watching your snaps

She said goodbye and left me in the cold
If I can't take it, I'm sorry
I need good vibes, if not, leave me alone
I swear I hate to see you walk away
But you look so damn good when you walk away
Do you ever think about stalkin' me
Cause I do just in case you been wondering
And I swear, that's why I'm watching your snaps
I'm stuck on your Instagram

Pretty bitches in my city litty, they just going up
Nigga, you just wanna be around me 'cause my money up
Heard them goofy niggas tryna line me, they don't want smoke with us
Had to pop an Addy, I was down, yeah, had to focus up
Most my niggas dogs, I hit up bitches that my homies fucked
I hear too much me in niggas' songs, so I had to switch it up, I had to switch it up
Pick out diamonds in particular 'cause I'm just rich as fuck
Rest in peace to that boy Trayvon, I got my hoodie up
They know exactly how we give it up, shoot a bully up
And you bitches know that I cannot waste no time
Bitch, I'm really grindin'
If I ever said, "I love you", never mind it
Especially when I feel like you out here thottin'
I threaten you, but I fuck with you, let's be honest
I hide the fact that I love to smoke on exotic
Flowers, I give you all my hours
I fuck around, I miss you though, I promise
Bonnie and Clyde issues, guns around us
No bozos in my circle, they get cut quick
We can't even get around, I got my hoodie on in public
House arrest in Florida, they always checked up on me
So when I was in the studio I said I was in Publix
If you could walk in my shoes, you could walk on water
Percocets like NyQuil, got me buying sawed-offs
Since I been in high school, I been feeling heartless
I swear I was like you, now look at me ballin'
10K on one fit, fly like I departed
Stay with that rocket, ooh, I go J. Harden
Can't tell if I got it, but I stay on it
And they stay frontin', but it ain't nothin'
'Cause I make money, talkin' big money
Mmh, if I go broke, stay away from me
Mmh, if I go broke, I'ma take money, yeah
I might go broke in my late hundreds
It's hard not to talk money 'cause I got money now
And these chains around my neck over two hundred thou
And Puma just gave me a budget, I should say, "Fuck it"
And give it to the schools 'cause they need it more than I need it now
Swear I paid my dues, I should speak up more though, I'm playin' quiet
Tryna keep it cool like the time I was in the studio with Future and his goons
Sittin' next to my favorite rapper, actin' scared to say it to him
Used to bump "March Madness," poppin' Addys because of you
After you and Drizzy dropped, then I got in tune 
Drizzy, that's my broski, I appreciate you too, yeah
First time in the Garden, it was all because of you, yeah

Listenin' to "D.T.B", yeah, that's our favorite song
I don't trust bitches
But you're just like me, that's why I don't trust bitches
This your favorite song
I don't love bitches
Fuck bitches, DTB, no, I don't trust bitches

The real artist, I go and draw it then paint it over
Last year me and sosa was sleepin' on sofas
Now I spend 10k just to fuck up my sofa
I got love for my brothers Snoopy, Don and Bubba
It's family first and we always look out for each other
The other day we was rollin' and the boys pulled us over
I keep a stash box, I know they was lookin' for toasters
The block was mad hot, we knew bitches wanna come over
It get mad hot, your enemies wanna be closer
They get mad and then the person they  it's over
It get bad out there, nigga, they shoulda known
That I'm a grown-ass man, I do what I wanna do
It get cold out there, nigga, so I be in the booth
Started out in the hooptie, nigga, now I be in the coupe
Come through in my hoodie, I ain't into an interview
Got caught up in the bookings, gave the laces up to my shoes
They don't wanna see me hang laces off of my Louis shoes
Worked on keepin' it easy, know how to keep my cool
All bankrolls, don't need to know what the pieces do
I don't know why you beggin', told you bitch I ain't eatin' you
Niggas feel a way when you treat 'em how they been treatin' you
Nigga, watch what you say, don't play us, start to believe it's true
So notorious with it, Gleezy with me, he keep the tool
My flow so remarkable
I go so retarded, loco
My clothes all designer though
I put bozos inside a chokehold
I go so retarded though
Put bozos inside—
Na na na na na na, Don!
My vision is clear, I'm the reason why these niggas is here
Tie the rope around your own neck, I'm kickin' the chair
Man up! Stop livin' with fear! I'm with the same gang
Ain't changed, too much traffic, you gotta make lanes
First of the month? I couldn't wait 'til that day came
Look, I deliver, take shorts and I take change
Guess it's my fault all we knew was the sidewalk
You feelin' froggy, leap, I ain't with the fly talk
I got the key to the city and I ain't makin' copies
Tryna get a key in my city? I gotta wait for papi
To make sure it's all there you gotta weigh it properly
Niggas watch my moves and try to plagiarize me
Switch plans, niggas careers in quick sand
Pitch tan or go invest in a quick scam
It's niggas that wanna hit you 'til the clip jam
So I stay close to an arm, I'm like a wristband
I'm Raekwon on the Purple Tape
Call an audible if they heard the play
Niggas impersonate tryna perpetrate
Gettin' paid early, I was workin' late
A job? I couldn't wait for work, I had work to weigh
I'm prolly on that purple drank or that brown water
And I'm still with them niggas that get the pounds ordered
He showin' off for the bitches then that's a clown for ya
They only there when you up, look
One of the last spitters left, packed stash in the sweats
We just want to push fast cars and cash bigger checks
Cops pull up? I turn into Flash in the flesh
'Cause I came a long way from gettin' harassed in the 'jects
Fuck your badge and your check, I spent that on a whole zip
Leave with my froze wrist if I kill on this road trip
Pull up to my old strip, same block where the coke pitch
Same block where the poles spit, niggas shootin' like, "Oh—"
White bitch named Caroline, she traffic in the caravan
The trunk look like an Avalanche
I move it out to Maryland
Always have a plan, take your loved ones out the hood
Not a vacation, my nigga, I'm talkin' out for good
Look, it was tough times, now we fuck dimes
I fuck niggas bitches, how can I trust mine?
Punchlines, remember freestylin' on the lunch line
Niggas said he was nice in the school, I'm who they come find
Look, nigga, Cuban linked up
With some niggas that'll make you give your Cuban link up
Pull up and they think they seen a brinks truck
You buy drinks, we just buy the bottles and let the bitches drink up
School of hard knocks was the class we takin'
Sad to say I've been to more funerals than graduations
School of hard knocks was the class we takin'
Sad to say I've been to more funerals—
I'ma keep goin' with shit
They know what it is
It's Hot 97
Funk Flex, A Boogie, Don Q
Highbridge the label
We here
This for them niggas that said that I never could do it
This that go and hit the street commit a felony music
And I get it for the low, you could never refuse it
I can get you the drugs, you gon' sell it or use it
But listen, I had a dream to become a kingpin
But the line between that and the cell seemed thin
My head above water, I'm tryin' not to sink in
It's gettin' hard, I'm already knee-deep in
They didn't have no evidence on you, then why you speak then?
Indicted yourself, you was only here for a weekend
Secrets you know in the street, you supposed to keep in
Went from a trip to bookings straight to the Beacon
I'll tell you how it's goin' to play out, this shit predictable
Your main bitch fuckin' your mans, she still visit you
Side bitch got knocked up, she put a kid on you
The wounds you can see but the pain is invisible
When you hustle for nights, thuggin' for stripes
Thinkin' that them fake niggas was your brothers for life
You just want to call home tell your mother good night
Make you wanna point a Vic' out and butter your knife
At this point you just feelin' like nothin' is right
But it's a part of the game when you in love with the life
Hold your chin up proud; and I know it's gettin' hard
For my niggas in the yard doin' chins up now
See, I been uptown, Bubba been uptown
I kept it real for so long, why would I switch up now?
Still runnin' with niggas that hit up crowds
So when it's on, put the women and the kids up now
Everybody can get it, everybody's a critic
But when you start sayin' names everybody's a cricket
You ain't even worth the bullets I got in the Smith'N
Might take a Jim Stahl: fill his body with stitches
See, I'm one of the elite, comin' from the street
Niggas dumpin' out the jeep, make you stumble out your sneaks
I just wanna blow a mil', spend a hunnit on a piece
They lookin' for my tape, most wanted on the beat
When you ribs get to touchin' and your stomach gettin' weak
We the wolves in the jungle that was huntin' all the sheep
You gotta keep a stash whenever the joints came in
Niggas tappin' them bags, I call it point shavin'
You see joints blazin', they aimed thangs rapid
So close to blood it stain they jacket
I ain't happy 'til I'm in that chain Maybach'in'
Or in Power sittin' in that James St. Patrick
That's a Ghost if you lames ain't catch it
Outta my mind snappin' top of the line fabric
Inside pocket, I'm hidin' the loud package
In one of those you gotta have thousands to buy jackets
Faggots! Bridge, nigga!
You know what the fuck it is, nigga!

Ra-ta-ta, pronto a sparare
Devi credere in te stesso, non ti puoi fidare

Questo posto è infame e io devo scappare in fretta
Serpi agli angoli, la strada è scura e stretta
Ma ora non mi posso più fermare, yah

Manco stamattina torno presto
Ha vinto l'orgoglio e non ci parliamo per questo
Io non mi guardo indietro, chi si guarda indietro è perso
Money, money, come tutti voglio farli, yah, yah
Mi ricordo dei treni dai mille pianti
Non mi ricordo quante ne ho scopate
Ma mi ricordo bene di noi assieme sulle scale, yah, yah
Contano i fatti
Solo lei sa come farmi, come truccarsi
Ora tutti alla mia porta vogliono entrare, fanculo
È grazie al mio culo se ancora ti ascolta qualcuno
Sopra i muri, muri vedi buchi, buchi
Fino a Brooklyn, baby
Movimenti giusti
Lei si muove giusta
Gucci, Fendi e Woolrich

And I don't even wanna feel how you feel, baby, I wanna be painless
Whatever you wanna do, I'm off of '42 and I do not want no chaser

Back when niggas was gettin' they Biggies and they Pelles took
Bitches used to curve me, used to swerve me, nigga, now look
They ain't never want me, now they askin' to get they nails done
I know I smell like dope, they gassin' me, tellin' me I smell good
Passin' me the pussy, I passed it to my homie real quick
Audacity to ask me 'bout the bitches that I still fuck
The audacity to ask me 'bout the bitches that I still fuck
Your ass is lookin' fat, them Fashion Nova jeans look real good
I'm glad that I came up 'cause I ain't know where I would end up
The thirty clip is on me but the hoodie cover my extendo
And niggas act so tough
But I just swear they don't wanna start, though
Let me tell you 'bout this young nigga from the Bronx, though
Everybody want his head, but nobody had his heart, though
Robbin' everybody like he don't believe in karma
Somebody told the feds what he did, they lined him
Told 'em where that nigga lived, yeah, they really lined him
He still sleepin' at his crib like fuck it if they find him
Price is on his head 'cause he hit a oppa
Money on his head got him movin' wiser
Hoodie on his head, they wanna pin his poncho
Pulled up to the crib, he livin' wit' his moms though
But they don't even care, they like, "Hit 'em all up"
His eyes turned red and his fists balled up
Voices in his head sayin', "Kill them all," but
Bullets hittin' glass, goin' through the walls, oh
All he heard was screamin', he feel like his time's up
He ain't have no time to go reach for a glove
He just grabbed the pump, start squeezin' at the door
But then he seen his moms laid out on the floor
He dropped down to his knees, head high to the Lord
Ain't the type to cry, but his mom, he really loved
Tears from his eyes dropped beside of the blood
He wishin' it won't hurt, but he cried 'cause it does
Then he put his own pump right to his mouth
Like nah-nah-nah
Yeah, nah-nah

When I say they don't want the smoke, they know just what I mean

Yeah, we on that same bullshit, sun up to sun down
Nigga pop out and get popped tryna run down
Go 'head, get popped tryna run down
Think a nigga bluffin', fuck around and get gunned down
I know I ain't perfect, but look I'm workin'
I could make a melody like, "Yeah, yeah"
We just turnin' up, what you really want?
They tryna tell us that we can't go back there
Don't tell me you love me, show me the money

Boogie, what up nigga?
Comin' up with the same niggas
I went broke, came up with the same niggas
When that last card hit that's a game winner
Drink sippers and I mix it with the painkillers
Paid niggas, small hood full of gravediggers
Make moves, pay dues, nigga stay true
Same crew, bitching and switching is what I can't do
Ridin' and my paint new
Got me swervin' all over the curb is what that drank do
Still avoiding the state troops
Hit the I-95 with a half tank
Make a stop at CVS just to grab blanks
Came from that milk crate, talkin' 'bout them corner nights
Had to get my daughter right, ain't leavin' 'til it's morning light
Rolling dice and pouring pints, never the sober type
Say you sold the price, get your block ate on a motorbike
Pussy niggas all alike, that's why we ignore the hype
I let this 40 ring, 40 days, 40 nights
I'm a cold nigga, lyrics make your soul shiver
Dust fiends looking for water, I bring the whole river
You looking for your daughter, I'm on the road with her
Fresh out the trap, dropping O's on the stove with her
I went broke, came up with the same niggas
When that last card hit that's a game winner
Drink sippers and I mix it with the painkillers
Paid niggas, small hood full of gravediggers
You think I changed nigga?
Ha!, I'm still the same nigga
I'm with my gang
You call them goons, I call them gravediggers
When I was locked down, made me feel like a slave nigga
I'm A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie and a chain nigga
Now I'm ballin' like Harden, yeah this a game winner
Game winner, rocket on me like I'm James nigga
Hanging out the window with it, asking what you claim nigga
Don't you try to play with us, got some dubs with me
I'm with a nigga who might go shoot up the club for me, ha!
Poppin' bottles in the club and I ain't old enough
Whoever thought it'd be like this when I was growing up
She know what's up
She sucking dick while I'm rolling up
Don't hold me up
Get a bank card and open up
You know it's us when you see designer from toe and up
We blowing up, my nigga we really blowing up
My dough is up
Ain't know where to put it, I couldn't fold it up
Ten thou' in my Balmains just to hold 'em up
Switch lanes to that fast lane, try to slow me up
Big chains, I need mad chains cause my dough is up
I went broke, came up with the same niggas
And when that last card hit that's a game winner, game winner

Fly her out, after I fuck her I'ma stay far away
Young nigga in a iced out 3D necklace

No cap at all
Niggas started movin' rock and put away the basketball

Stacking more, spending less, you niggas still in debt
They love the Don cause the arm looks like Lucky Charms
I just want to count a hundred grand and hug my mom
Tell her it's nothing wrong
The sun's shining and we made it through the thunderstorm
No more rain, now all I see is the hundreds pouring
Them bitches played before, now we just stunting on 'em
Wait, I ain't coming for 'em
I got better shit to do
See through the years I done lost a good friend or two
This shit is pitiful
I walk up in the spot dressed down like an interview
Then it's to the block, spilling lean on my tennis shoes
I'm December cool
Say what's your name again baby? you know it been a few
And if the pussy weak I probably won't remember you
I probably had to doubt we in the mineral
You know I like to mix it with the chemical
'Til a nigga in the mood, and I see the ceiling move
I'm the one they listen to, you the one they skipping through
Nigga lives on that corner where niggas died
I'm where hard rock and heavy metal, that Ozzy Osbourne
It's shit I got to keep my mind on
Snakes in the grass gon' come in with they disguise on
Those the main niggas that you gotta keep your eyes on
But it's hard to tell when them the niggas you relied on
Damn, look, your nigga is back
Thought I was gon' fall off? how silly is that
I stood dolo in the cold and got rid of the pack
And I'm talking way before I remembered a rap
Catch me in the heights, right where the Dominicans at
Me and Boogie, a few thots, make 'em fit in the back
Of the coupe, they ain't loose, then we sending them back
Nigga speeding for no reason, got me spilling my yak
See I'm just tryna sit and relax and flip up a pack
Probably go visit the trap and pick up a stack
Keep calm, it ain't the tens and the Timberlands black

They don't give out free Porsche trucks, I had to boss up
Fifty hanging off my necklace, my shit water
Don't reach and watch your step, yeah don't get crossed up

If you try to hit and miss, do you believe in karma?
If you plottin' I can best believe you gon' get caught up
My nigga Dre a monster, he straight out of Compton
Yeah I'm all about my business, 'bout my chicken
If I put you on a mission, you'll be rich then
You can't get into my vision, this shit different

A black hoodie and some black boots
A ski mask with a hat that match
So that's black on black on black on black on black on black
And bitch I'm running down
Matter fact I used to fuck with niggas that go back to back on me in situations
Like if I get hit up then my niggas quick to let that MAC attack
And now I'm going down
'Cause where I'm from you either clap the ratchet or the ratchet clap at niggas that be actin'
Better have it on you 'cause I got it on me I ain't havin' that
And when I come around
I ain't playing no games with them

The rockers of ganja 
We got the shit that be breaking the glass like it's opera
Tats on my skin the ink it was there
But I love the fucking pain nigga
Smoking so much weed a nigga can't even see think I'm fucking going insane nigga
Addicted to paranoia 
This is a sign of creativity
Like I'm looking in the sky then I wonder why damn weed really hittin' me

I turn my home to a trap
You want a pound?

Quarterback this gat, and we letting bullets fly
Yo homies pourin' beer in front the church yo momma cry
My niggas with it don't do prison
Hit a witness in his eye 
But the streets ain't the same gotta change routes
Gotta show a nigga what your aim about
Real niggas in trouble 'cause we live in the jungle
Where snakes and rats can hang out... man
It's really getting strange out, trust easy something you can do
Keep your gun cocked and your eyes too
Can't even look at niggas the same now
Watch hoes don't​ be a fool
Your day ones and day twos
Keep your circle small, gotta watch your crew
'Cause your barber not the only one lining you
I'm just glad that all my niggas loyal
Been taught to stay 100

Touching me when I'm performing an shit
These niggas acting like informers my nigga
Dead wrong dead wrong, talking on the cellphone, cellphone
Better watch how you talk to me, talking out your asshole
You was in the Honda Civic, I was in the Murcielago
You will get mad and start trippin, you broke all my iPhones
Kiss me, love me, tell me that you want me
I wish I was heartless, I'll be like you
Even when we fall apart I know that, you gon always end up falling right through
Don't you go around talking 'bout shit that we do

That's just how I feel
Don't you lie lie lie

Look, undercover love is hard to be the one who knows
To play the sidenigga knowing you can't let it show
Cause it was fun and games until I started thinking 'bout it
Bitch you not gon' play me if I want you, he don't keep you happy
I'm not the type to go and really care but damn I miss it when you used to run your fingers through my hair
And pictures being sent to each other just to have em all
Drunk nights made you happy, me and you always had a ball
After sober blunts 'bout what we did the night before
Silly convos through the text we never called each other's phone
Cause I knew my place and now it starts to get to me
Cause knowing I can't have you when I snap back to reality
This shit is getting crazy cause I never thought we'd get attached
Arguments we always had cause you always made me mad
But now I see that all I did was set myself up for the trap
Cause you know you better off with him
But you know that's not gonna last
Show me something real if you really down to ride for me
Show me something real don't you ever fucking lie to me
Show me something real I don't care if it's gonna hurt
I'd rather be the one that knows that he ain't half of what i'm worth
Show me something real if you really down to ride for me
Show me something real don't you ever fucking lie to me
Show me something real I don't care if it's gonna hurt
I'd rather be the one that knows that he ain't half of what i'm worth
Knowing every move I make and how I am with someone else
Anything I've asked of you ain't always end up being done
But when that nigga asks you for something man you always jump
I don't wanna be a side nigga cause I fell in love
How you think I feel when I can't talk about you to my dawg
It wasn't 'posed to be like this but I seen it coming
Shit was getting hectic and you quick to start running from it
Cause you care about yourself, fuck whatever happens to me
I was fucking stupid, making you what really mattered to me
They don't need to know the details cause you know you wrong
And you know you the only reason why I wrote this song
Show me something real, show me something real
Have respect when I'm around, you know how to hold it down
I don't wanna see you with no hickeys on your fucking neck
And always keep that nigga in a box and make sure it's checked
Show me something real if you really down to ride for me
Show me something real don't you ever fucking lie to me
Show me something real I don't care if it's gonna hurt
I'd rather be the one that knows that he ain't half of what i'm worth
Show me something real if you really down to ride for me
Show me something real don't you ever fucking lie to me
Show me something real I don't care if it's gonna hurt
I'd rather be the one that knows that he ain't half of what i'm worth
He ain't half of what I'm worth

Nananananana
Baby girl, lets start slow
I dont want to fuck up and get your heart broke
They dont want to me come up nigga i know

Old hoes be so cold, so cold

Rose Gold before i spend this shit in snowWhen I come over ride
Like I'm a Maserati
Go fast, or go slow
I think the feds is watching
Think I'll be catching bodies
And if they ask just say "I don't"
Better not come over Friday
Are you gon' tell somebody?
Say yes, or say no
I think the feds is watching
Think I'll be catching bodies
And if they ask just say "I don't"
I really need somebody with me
I don't think nobody gets me
You don't get it? Mind your business
In my bag, until it's empty
I really need somebody with me
I don't think nobody gets me
Are you with me or against me?
I stay grippy like I'm 50
I ain't worried 'bout the police
I can't blink without the  on me
They must think I caught a body
Extortion without a shotty
Bobby stepping with my Whitney
She come through, I get her tipsy
Fuck her good, she call me Papi
Switch positions, give her options
Now she wanna stay with me
I say "Sorry but I'm busy"
Now she calling me cocky
Ice on my pinky looking Rocky
Stacks hang out the pocket stupid
Stuck in the trenches, I was ruthless
Stuck on the bench, I couldn't do it
Most of the bitches speak truth-less
I swear I ain't got no time for it
If they can't make it, they copy it
Me and my stylist are stylist
We pick out our outfits
You know I'ma body it
I was just picking out colleges
Now I'm performing at colleges
I watch the money keep piling
They hate while they smiling
I always acknowledge it
When I come over ride

Lil bitch this ain’t no mother fucking theme song
You know I pop pills 'til the pain gone
I know they wanna catch me slipping
But it ain’t worth it
And I be tranna do it all
But I ain’t perfect
And I don’t want no goofy niggas in my damn circle
Fuck it ima quit rapping if the band working
And even though I been rolling with the same niggas
I started noticing I ain’t really the same nigga
I started wearing more watches wearing more rings nigga
Yeah shoot out the money can’t really change niggas
Yeah, and I come through Christians on my feet
Girl we gon' bleed together
And I know you gonna keep it G who you gonna need forever
Girl you know that I get a lotta
Money but that’s nothing
Girl you know how I feel about ya
It’s hard to show you that I care about ya
If it come down to it I’ll probably do a drill 'bout ya
Mm
Mm mm mm mmI woke up to like ninety-nine missed calls
That's like ninety-nine people I probably pissed off
Like damn, nigga, I was on a jail call
Damn, niggas make me hate my cell phone
Like damn, my nigga, I'm in the studio
Last time I dropped an album was like a year ago
Yeah, you tellin' me you starving, but I been to there
Like growin' up, breakfast, lunch and dinner wasn't cereal
I know what's up
You just wanna be all in the videos and smoke it up
I know you ain't really with the shits but you just throw it up
Pretty bitches in my city litty, they just going up
Nigga, you just wanna be around me 'cause my money up
I heard them goofy niggas tryna line me, they don't want smoke with us
Had to pop an Addy, I was down, yeah, I had to focus up
Most my niggas dogs, I hit up bitches that my homies fucked
I hear too much me in niggas' songs, so I had to switch it up, I had to switch it up
I pick out diamonds in particular 'cause I'm just rich as fuck
Rest in peace to that boy Trayvon, I got my hoodie up
We know exactly how we give it up, shot a bully up
And you bitches know that I cannot waste no time
Bitch, I'm really grindin'
If I ever said, "I love you", never mind it
Especially when I feel like you out here thottin'
I threaten you, but I fuck with you, let's be honest
I hide the fact that I love to smoke on exotic
Flowers, I give you all my hours
I fuck around, I miss you though, I promise
Bonnie and Clyde issues, guns around
No bozos in my circle, they get cut
We can't even get around, I got my hoodie on in public
House arrest in Florida, they always checked up on me
So when I was in the studio I said I was in Publix
If you could walk in my shoes, you could walk on water
Percocets like NyQuil, got my buying sawed-offs
Since I been in high school, I been feeling heartless
I swear I was like you, now look at me ballin'
10K on one fit, fly like I departed
Stay with that rocket, ooh, I go J. Harden
Can't tell if I got it, but I stay on it
And they stay frontin', but it ain't nothin'
'Cause I make money, talkin' big money
Mmh, if I go broke, stay away from me
Mmh, if I go broke, I'ma take money, yeah
I might go broke in my late hundreds
It's hard not to talk money 'cause I got money now
And these chains around my neck over two hundred thou
And Puma just gave me a budget, I should say, "Fuck it"
And give it to the schools 'cause they need it more than I need it now
I swear I paid my dues, I should speak up more though, I'm playin' quiet
Tryna keep it cool like the time I was in the studio with Future in the room
Sittin' next to my favorite rapper, actin' scared to say it to him
Used to bump "March Madness," poppin' Addys because of you
After you and Drizzy dropped, then I got in tune 
Drizzy, that's my broski, I appreciate you too, yeah
First time in the Garden, it was all because of you, yeah
I probably was OD-in' to do a song but I was new, yeah
I can't lie, oh, you was like my idol, ask my crew, yeah
Right when I thought viral was viral, Tekashi blew, yeah
And that's my nigga too, I fuck with you, I swear to God
Type of nigga keep that shit a hundred, cameras off
And I'm the type of nigga you might see in Saint Laurent
Different places, Cleveland, Miami, but I ain't LeBron
With different bitches, denims lookin' like they painted on
Listenin' to "D.T.B", yeah, that's our favorite song
Yeah, I don't trust bitches
Bitches just like me, that's why I don't trust bitches
This your favorite song
I don't love bitches
Fuck bitches, DTB, no, I don't trust bitches
This your favorite song
When you're home, all alone
Reminiscin' my Dior cologne
No going back, I really took your soul
I know, yeah
I woke up with the chills, oh, oh
Took a pill with my milk, oh, oh
Like it's not a big deal, oh, oh
Free all of my bros, whoa, oh
Free my nigga PeeWee, free my nigga Skills, now
Man, you gotta see me, see how I came up now
Used to wear the same shit, I ain't lookin' like no bum now
I'm a New York nigga, hangin' laces off my Uptowns
Grew up in the jungle where they rumblin' for dust now
Runnin' 'round the BX, RIP to Big Pun, now
Look, I said RIP to Big Pun
And I don't know why
I swear these niggas wanna take my life
And it's so hard
I feel like they wanna take my lifeLyrics From Snippet
I don't wanna
I don't wanna fight with you
I just wanna make love
If thats alright with you

Can't leave the country, they felons already
Fuck it at least they know better
Any nigga will tell 
I just seen niggas tell on their brothers
And them niggas was there for there for you when they were struggling
I just seen niggas stuck on their bitches will kiss and hug them right after she sucking dick
And you better watch out for niggas that watching your money
Watch who you get money with
And don't you go compete with your own gang
And don't you go be on no funny shit
Niggas want to tell on a whole gang, because they were jealous, oh, jealous

        Lyrics From Snippet
I don't wanna play with your emotions
You know imma' ride for you like the whip is stolen 
45 by my side all the time now 
Nigga's baby momma's calling me their Dada 
I know you ain't really crazy nigga calm down 
This choppa ain't got no safety go RaRa
 let me roll it
I wanted to fuck, you want to hold handsLyrics from Snippet
I don't wanna see no one wit' you, I don't see no one but you
If you was me I bet you would be fucking up too, I bet you can't walk in my shoes
You made me feel like I always had something to prove, I did a bunch of shit for you
I cut off bitches just for you, I copped Givenchy just for you
I got a show out in Miami, Should I cancel it for you?
It wouldn't be fair to you if I wasn't there for you, puttin' money over you
Do I really have to choose? Money or you?
I gotta admit it to you...
I don't need you baby, but if you down alright I want you baby
Don't stress me out at night, just let me love you
And let me live my life, let me be
But don't trust me baby, don't even trust myself
Don't try to change meIt's JoeFromYO
DLo on the beat
She tryna link up then eat up the line guys
Hit you up from a blindside, yeah
Bitches be sneaky, pull up with the Glock out
'Cause a nigga might pop out
My neck and my wrist, it's a million wide side
Got 'em lookin' so cockeyed
Fuck it 'cause niggas don't ever be outside
And we never ain't outside
I'm finna shoot better watch out
I got the chopper from Moscow
Pull up we shootin' your house down
Try me this shit can get hostile
I just got a new Rollie, it's iced out
All this water on my neck, I might drown
Set a trap and hope the feds don’t find out
Nigga try me, send his ass to iCloud
I had a bell and the stick on me 
Screamin' fuck you and your big homie 
I went to court with the CIG on me 
Bad bitches, nothin’ but some tens on me
Wet up your block, when you leave me a show
And I hope you get hit it like ten homies
I got a whole I family, they depend on me
I was at ten, couple tens on me
Used to be down and I was so broke
And I ran this shit up, used to sleep in the bando
They pass me the rock 'cause they know I got handle
Young niggas rich as a bitch with no manners
Look here, lil' bitch, you just look what you started
Pull up and shut down your party
And we like three of the hardest
Trap Manny with me, we went, got the Artist
I was fifteen when I got my first carbon
Shot my first nigga and that's when it started
We sippin' lean when we walk in the buildings
Pour up the drink and no fuckin' Bacardi
I'm in the Maybach, I'm closin' the curtains
I used to stand on the block, used to serve
I gave her forty racks inside a Birkin
I can't talk to the bitch if she ain't perfect
She tryna link up then eat up the line guys
Hit you up from a blindside, yeah
Bitches be sneaky, pull up with the Glock out

Stupid bitch tryna hit me up in line guys
But I'm watchin' my blindside
I'm ridin' the Maybach, the body is wide size
And I'm sippin' while I drive
I'm in the penthouse, it sit on a high rise
Shit, I barely get Wi-Fi
Bring the Perc' 10's and I'm tryna get high-high
Shit, my life is like Syfy
Boogie got his hoodie on like the grim reaper
And we ain't got no friends neither
In your city in the sprinter, yeah, it's a ten seater
Nigga we could've been deeper
But when I bring out the goons, they wanna end people
Yeah, you know them boys been eatin'
When they get in that mood, you better start tuckin' your jewels
It get hard to defend people
She tryna link up then eat up the line guys

We was never scared though, posted like a scarecrow
My pockets shoulda said rest in peace, I was dead broke
We was hungry, just tryna eat, but they said no
Steady pacin', life is a race and nobody said go
But fuck it, I ain't givin' up

Tellin' me they never hatin', when I know they probably wait to see me stumble
King of the jungle, I know they lyin', fakin'
Tellin' me to be patient but nigga I ain't waitin'
Try and stop me, they wanna pop me, but nigga I ain't bacon
I'm just sayin' they wanna cut me but they can't cut no deeper

And I'm looking for ZimmermanSana karşı iyi değil miydim?
Cardo'nun kanatları var
Evet, en azından sana karşı iyiydim
En azından sana karşı iyiydim
En azından sana karşı iyiydim
En azından sana karşı iyiydim
Siktiğimin sözlerini tutamıyorum
Yaşam tarzım kontrolden çıkıyor, yaşam tarzım gittikçe saçmalaşıyor
1 yıldan az sürede 1 milyon kazandım ve aptal bir bokun üzerinde mahvettim
Savannah sadece performansımı görmek istemişti
Ve aptal bir bok tarafından vuruldu
Kalktım ve boku telefonumda gördüm
Onlar vuranın kim olduğunu bilmiyorlardı
Asla bilemezsin, asla dokunulmaz hissetmeyeceksin
Ruhuna dokundum, seni çok huzurlu yaptım
Eğer gitmene izin verirsem, çok süphe içinde hissederdim
Kabul edilemez fakat hala bilmen gerek
Evet, bu siktiğimin sözlerini tutamıyorum
Siktiğimin sözlerini yapamıyorum, siktiğimin sözlerini yapamıyorum
Evet, yaşam tarzım yolunda, Tanrım
Hep Rollex kullanmak isterdim, şimdi yeni bir two-tone altın patek istiyorum
Evet, phillipe’se gitmemeliydik
Sabah gelene kadar köşede olmak zorundaydım
Bu sayede ben ve zenciler yemek yiyebilirdik
Kapıda ki ayağımı çektim
Onlar asla bana anahtarı vermediler, ben anahtarı çevirdim
Ben çocukken bile
Sokaklardaki adamdım, kızgın adamdım
Ben canavardım, tanrım
O kızın kalbine sahipti, ama kız bana vermeyi denedi
Lanet olsun,ama kız o siktiğimin sözünü tutamadı
Siktir, bir sürü parayla geliyorum, paralar da bir sürü bokla
Mo'ya söyledi,"stüdyoyu gittiğimiz her yere götür" ve bu da bir çok hit
Kliplerim yavaş çekimde,ışık söndüğün de, bütün elmaslerım parlar
Mavi yüzler hakkında bir şey, para muhabbetlerini severim
Bir çok 20'ler bunlar basit, zenci, siktir et, ben edepsizim
Ispiyoncu zencilerle dalga geçemezsin, eğer yakalanırsan, bir bok söyleme
Sen hiç benim gibi bir zenciyle karşılaştın mı? bahse girerim hiçbir şey demeyeceksin
Paçavra kıyafetlerden zenginliğe gittim
Bana gülmeyen suratlı orospuyla sex yaptım
En kötüsüyle yapmışım
Bu üzücü fakat aynı gün için de terslendim
Onları kötü bir şekilde aşağıladım
Kötü olmazdım eğer aynı şekilde aşağılanmasaydım
O yüzden beni aynı şekilde aşağıla,aynı şekilde , aynı şekilde
Sana karşı vahşiydim
Pesetmek ve bütün orospularımı kenara koymak zorundaydım
Yemin ederim ki eğer seni soğukta bıraktıysam
Içerisi daha soğuk olduğundandır
Buraya bak,yemin ederim ki beni bir kere yalnız bırakmaya çalıştıysan
Umarım bir fahişeye dönmemişsindir
Beni arayan zencilerin çoğu telefonuma bildirim gönderiyorlar
Çünkü çok para elde ettim
Ben tahtım ile tekim
Sen katlanacağım diyorsun ama zenci biliyoruz ki bu bir yalan
Biz olmadan önce bile
Para uzundu  ve biz onu mekanlarda dağıtırdık
Fahişeler şarkılarımı söylüyor
Biliyordum ordaydım, saatimi elmasla kapladığım
Zenciler önceden benden nefret ederdi şimdi daha çok ediyorlar
Ama şimdi bana ne söyleyeceklerini bilmiyorlar
Bunu ona yapacaktım, fakat onu kullanmak istemedim
Verilen mazeretleri tut, ne zaman gerçekten birleşeceğiz
Aptalca konuşsam bile, ona gerçek olanı söyleyeceğim
Dürüst olmasa bile, siktir et yine de sana karşı hala iyi olacağım
Evet, en azından sana karşı iyiydim
En azından sana karşı iyiydim
En azından sana karşı iyiydim
En azından sana karşı iyiydimLyrics from Leak

        Yeah
Wasn't I good to you?
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
Yeah
I can't make no fucking promises
Lifestyle getting out of control, lifestyle getting ludicrous
I made a milli' in less than a year and I blew that on stupid shit
Typed it in like, "How to make a milli'" I used to google it
Savannah just wanted to see me perform
And got hit over stupid shit
I woke up and saw the shit right on my phone
They don't know who the shooter is
You never know, never feel untouchable
I touched your soul, made you feel so comfortable
If I let you go, I would feel so skeptical
Unacceptable but I still gotta let you know
Yeah, that I can't make no fucking promises
I can't make no fucking promises, I can't make no fucking promises
Yeah, lifestyle on the road, sheesh
Used to always want a Rollie, now I want a new two-tone gold Patek
Yeah, we couldn't go to Phillipe's
I had to be on that corner until it was morning
So me and my niggas could eat
I be the one with the sauce, I never thought it was sweet
I got my foot in the door
They never gave me the key, I had to turn to a ki
Even when I was a boy
I was the man in the streets, I was the man with the heat
I was a beast, sheesh
He had her heart, but she tried to give it to me
Yeah, damn, but she can't keep no fucking promises
Shit, I'm coming with a lotta money, money comes with a lotta shit
Told Mo, "Bring the studio to everywhere we go" and that's a lotta hits
Slo-mo in my videos, when the lights out, all my diamonds hit
Something 'bout blue faces, I like money conversations
Whole lotta 20's that's basic, nigga, fuck it, I'm shameless
Can't fuck with a snitch nigga, if you get caught, don't say shit
Have you ever met another nigga like me? I bet you won't say shit
I went from rags to riches
I bagged the bitches that gave me the straight face
I hit the baddest bitches
It's sad but I had to curve 'em the same day
I treated them bad
I wouldn't be mad if I was to get treated the same-
So treat me the same way, same way, same way
I was a savage to you
I had to give up and put all my hoes to the side
I swear if I ever left you in the cold
It's 'cause it was colder inside
Look here, I swear if you ever try to leave me alone
I hope you don't turn to a thot
Most of the niggas that call me only hit my phone
Because I get money a lot
I be the one with the throne
You say you gon' take it but nigga we know that's a lie
Even before we was on
The money was long and we used to fuck up the spot
Bitches was singing my song
I knew I was on, right when I bust down on a watch
Niggas was hating before and they hate on me now
But don't know what to say to me now
I was gonna do it to her, but I don't really wanna use her
Keep giving excuses, when we really gonna link up?
Even if I sound stupid, I'ma say what's real to her
Even if she not truthful, fuck it I'ma still be good to you
Yeah, at least I was good to you, yeah
At least I was good to you, yeah
Wasn't I good to you? Yeah
At least I was good to you
At least I was good to-
Wasn't I good- ? Yeah
Wasn't I good to you?Yeah
What the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ayy
Gotta pray a lot niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Hold up, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ayy
Gotta pray a lot, niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy
Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ayy
If I feel a way then I'm gon' say it to your face, ayy
If I play the block, I'll goin' make 100K, ayy
Hold up, I'll goin make 100K, yeah
If they put a price on me, I'll double what they pay, yeah
They say they don't like me, give a fuck 'bout what they say, yeah
I could take your bitch and make you think about what you say, yeah
I'm gon' put her in a leg lock like MMA, yeah
I'm gon' let her give me head twice if she don't say shit
If she ever turn sherm on me then she basic
Couple bitches had to swerve on 'em, I updated
You pulled up with her, she ain't leave with who she came with
She deserve better, you's a bird, you's a wasteman
Fuck a umbrella, change weather in my spaceship
Diamonds dancing, I'm two-stepping with my bracelet
So, get the fuck up out my face
I'm just on my way to get this money and I'm late, okay
In the strip club throwing twenties like "I'll be okay"
100k a day, trap booming like an 808
Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ayy
Gotta pray a lot niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy
Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ayy
If I feel a way then I'm gon' say it to your face, ayy
If I play the block today
Talking shit don't ever get to me
When they see me now, they'd better have that same energy
In abandoned houses, in and out, it wasn't shit to me
When you see me now, don't try to act like you remember me
Then look at me now, bitch I'm drowning
And my hoodie Saint Laurent, it's a thousand
And we come straight out the Bronx so we wildin'
Shoutout BK, free Bobby and free Rowdy
Free my nigga V12, holla if you see 12
Febreze, believe me, it'll cover the weed smell
I probably got 3 mil', sitting in my email
So much on me, they second guessing what we sell
So much money on me, fuck it if it's dirty money
'Cause I earned it, you get murked if you come searchin' for me
When the police pulled me over, I had 30 on me
What the fuck I look like with less than 30 on me, nigga?
Yeah
Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ayy
Gotta pray a lot niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy
Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ayy
If I I feel a way then I'm gon' say it to your face, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, yeahI'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm-
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I'm with all my niggas, I don't go nowhere without 'em
If they don't let us in they might throw shots at the-
Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor's
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta
Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the 9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher
She looked at my wrist and she looked at a hundred thousand
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a-
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a- 
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
Yeah
Bitch I'm drownin', yeah

        Ness on the beat
Givenchy all over my body
She calling me Papi
I'm killing her Doggy style
Rottweilers in the lobby
Have you ever seen a doggy hold a 40 cal
Bitches that thought I was nobody talk about me
And they all wanna know me now
Niggas that thought I was nobody talked about me
But they calling me brodie now
Day one, don't mean they're A1
Nigga, you just got to hold it down
Nowadays, niggas try way way to hard to be my homie now
I was stuck in public housing, but now I can buy a few Rollies now
I was chilling by that 24 took off
They calling me Kobe now
Damn son, I'm the man son, and I'm handsome
With my bands up
Call me Bandsome, Phantom parked in the mansion
Lot of handguns, I just hope that you undеrstand us
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I ain't playing, boy I fuck with gorillas
Big Body with a couplе of killers
Gloves on I come in like its Thriller
All my jeans got a couple of zippers
I'm A Boogie if I wanted her I get her
If not then I'm fucking her sister
Rooftop disappear it go missing
Me and you could disappear and go missing 
We could hop in the coupe and go missing
Got the trunk in the front and the back got the engine
I ain't cuffing these hoes I'm resisting
Got no time to lay up, I just score in the system
Remember nights that my stomach was cringing
In my cell thinking how imma get out the system
I ain't tryna do life go in prison
Even though you alive, you ain't really living
Fuck that, tryin' man, I'm tryna get rich
Nigga spend my shot like an eclipse
Double cup full of a Kool, you know what I sip
Remeber back in the G going high for a nic
Now a days, in a day, I'm airin' to the zip
Try runnin' down on me, run up and get hit
It ain't bout a dollar, then that don't make no sense
Making ends meet until I get me an M
Pullup in that 6, it gotta come with an M
Hit the gas and be gone in the wind
Try taking my chain, I might catch an attempt
Chopper leave him curled up like a shrimp
Niggas better check-in when they come to the bridge
Or end up floating somewhere under a bridge
Niggas wave ridin', they don't know how to swim
New Givenchy drip, I just got it from Fifth, yeah

You mad, nigga, your adrenaline rushin', it feel like a bus, but I'm whippin' the Wraith
Sen çıldrımışsın zenci adrenalinin coşuyo, ambulans gibi hissettiriyo ama lüks arabalarla takılıyorum
Got my head to the ceiling, want me in my feelings, only got me feelin' a way
Kafamı tavana dayadım,kendimi duyguların içinde isityorum,sadece yoldaymışım hissi veriyo
I ain't sayin' I'm addicted, Adderall prescripted, fuck it 'cause I don't feel the pain
Bağımlı olduğumu söylemedim,Adderall şart,nedenini siktir et çünkü acıyı hissetmek istemiyorum
Let a nigga touch my chain, fuck it, nigga, kill him, fuck it, they can take me away
Bırak da bi zenci zincirime dokunsun ,siktir et,öldür onu,beni götürеbilirler
I got my dawgs in this bitch, I know they gon' shoot shit up
Bu sürtükle birliktе olan dostlarım var,biliyorum onlar ateş edip korkutacaklar
And my lil' brother turned to a drummer
Walked him outside, now he got the llama
Ve küçük kardeşim bir bateriste dönüştü ve  azraili onu yoklayacak,şimdi onda ılama var
I took that Maybach where the J's at
Maybachı aldım j s nerde
Tell my brothers ball a hundred summers
Kardeşlerime söyleyin 100 summers I sikerim

Yüz binlikleri prada pantalonuma koyduğumda
Got some little homies, got some prodigies
Biraz dost birkaç dahi var
And I spent five hundred on Prada tees
Ve prada kravtlara 500 lük harcıyorum
Made it out the projects, poppin' overseas
Shawty gave me sloppy toppy on the seat
Güzellik bana koltukta saksoyu çeker
I make some calls, you can't cop the fleet
Bikaç arama yaparım ,çetemi cezalandırmassın
Gotta be an antisocial gangster 'cause the feds watchin' my tweets
Federaller tweetlerimi izlediği için Antisosyal bir gangsta olmalısın
You mad, nigga, your adrenaline rushin', it feel like a bus, but I'm whippin' the Wraith
Got my head to the ceiling, want me in my feelings, only got me feelin' a way

Fuck it, I ran up the numbers
Siktir et onlarlala kapışıyorum
Piped up like a plumber
Sikim kalktı bir pornocu gibi
And sold all the bundles 
Ve tüm eroin paketleris satıldı
I paid off the debt to your honor
Şerefine olan borcumu ödedim
And went got some commas and commas and commas 
Ve gittim  paralarlave  paralarla ve paralarla binlikk
You let it get to your head, yeah, I remember when you was a runner 
Kafana sok ,senin ayak işlerini yaptığın zamanları biliyorum
I heard you got snatched by the feds, yeah, say you willin' to tell 'em whatever 
Federaller tarafından tutulduğunu duydum, evet, onlara ne olursa olsun  söyleyeceksin
I still be killin' in projects, even though I been runnin' them numbers up
Toplu konutlarda hala öldürüyorum,onlarla mücadele etmeme rağmen
They used to tell me I'm not next, I'm like look at me now, I'm in front of them
Bana eskiden sıradaki sensin derlerdi ,bana şimdi bir bak,karşılarında duruyorum
And I just hope you never set me up, my lifestyle too irregular
Ve uamrım ki beni asla tongaya getirmessin ,Hayatım çok kuralsız
And I don't know how I'ma trust again, I swear
Ve bilmiyorum sana nasıl güvenicem ,yeminle
Audemars might fuck up your eyes, yeah

Cayenne nin içinde hızlanmak isitiyorum

Çete ile Havuz partim var

These fuck niggas don't where the drop at 
They won't want us ridin' in the drophead
Rolls Royce phantom coupe
And he mad that my bitch got a Masi'
You mad, nigga, your adrenaline rushin', it feel like a bus, but I'm whippin' the Wraith
Got my head to the ceiling, want me in my feelings, only got me feelin' a way
I ain't sayin' I'm addicted, Adderall prescripted, fuck it 'cause I don't feel the pain
Let a nigga touch my chain, fuck it, nigga, kill him, fuck it, they can take me away
I got my dawgs in this bitch, I know they gon' shoot shit up
And my lil' brother turned to a drummer
Walked him outside, now he got the llama
I took the Maybach where the J's at
Tell my brothers ball a hundred summers
All my niggas know run up them numbers
Fuck it, run up them numbersLyrics From Snippet
Sexy, your sexy
Want you to be my bitch, not my bestie
Want you to be my bitch, not my bestie
Nigga touch me chain, nigga i want blood but i'm christian
I'm grimey because i'm a bitch, I might turn my back on my bitch..
Drugs are prescripted, I know it ain't safe but we love to fuck with mixes
Skeet all over your face, make you fall in love with my childrenLyrics From Snippet
I see no EVOL yeah
Blood on my shoes from my Lyrics From Snippet
If I was you, I was you
Just keep it a hundred thousand if i was you
If i was just chilling in Miami Beach
Take a trip down to Fontainebleau
They watching you flex and they really upset
They gone say they ain't proud of you
I'm rocking Jordans today...
I feel like checking my dm today
Its whatever your tryna do
She said she from michigan
And im from the X so you can't be my bitch again
If you come to my city again
 we can be friends again
Im talkin so serious
Sorry if i make you feel so delirious
