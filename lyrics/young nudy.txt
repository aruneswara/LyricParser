        I wanna put you in seven positions for seventy minutes you get it bae
You got a lot on your mind and you really look like you just really really really gay
You put a light squeeze on the ice cream when I twist in and dip it in
Unzipping them tight jeans...
Yessir
You just took a sip of apple juice
You drank
You just smoked a clip you shaking
You got on adidas
You got chocolate chips on your face
You got a gold bed
You stink, You're ugly
What the fuck?
Been with the rapping since I was a shorty
They always hating, they tryna report me
I got my bitch in the stu and she horny
She wanna fuck on me while I'm recording
I'm with the guys, I gotta be cordial, 
I’m with the guys, you better be cautious, 
I'm with the guys who making you nauseous, 
I'm with the guys, we all wearing fly shit
Sipping lean, that's why the beat dizzy
Fuck on his bitch and I'm toting my glizzy, 
A nigga got options cause I got a semi
It's right by kidney, My nigga i'm litty
I'm toting two virgils you know I got 50’s 
Hold on, Slow down
Told that nigga to sit down
I’m finna give his ass six rounds, 
I'm finna blow that bitch down
Nigga you talking behind my back, you lame 
You is a weirdo, we not the same
You can not rap nigga stay on the game
If I see his bitch then I'm running a train 
Choo-Choo
Nigga I'm the goat like Mewtwo
Go look at my shit on youtube
I'm finna sketch, finna doodle
Make a song while I’m cooking my noodles
Niggas was hating but fuck it, it's cool tho
Now I be hopping right out of the two door
You niggas pull up to work on a scooter, 
You niggas pull up to school on a scooter
Let me reel in myself emotionally
Im trying to be cool, It's just hard
I'm tired of suffering
I'm tired of suffering:
I’m a 90s baby know bout 80 bitch I know bout crack
I'm a young nigga keep a 30 everybody know bout that
Keep yo bitch on these fuckin drugs, hit yo hoe from the back
I don’t love her, I don’t wife yo hoe, all these hoes know bout that
I’m a crack pot, drug dealin, I’m gon sell that crack
I’m gon sell that crack
Whippin up nothin but glass
In the kitchen makin' nothin but crack, y’all don’t know bout that
First junky that hit that bitch damn near had a heart attack
:
I turned a one into a deuce
I turned a deuce into a four
I turned a four into a nine
Water whippin' bitch i make me some more
Young nigga really wanted some more
Glock 40 it hold 30 or more
Young nigga play you act like a hoe
Main thing, I’ma fuck on yo hoe
Play with me I’ma play with her throat
Play with the pot like i play with the scope
Pussy niggas wanna hate from the rope
One shot hit yo ass in the throat
A lot of guns and a whole lot of smoke
Yellow tape for you and yo folks
Country nigga talking bout he know dose
I don’t think he know about that dope
I just sold his ass a whole elbow
Yea the flower that i got from the store
Right there at the Texaco
32 on Bouldercrest Road
Young nigga know how the game go
I'ma slime everything that you own
:
:
Walked in looking like a chandelier
Hell nah nigga we don’t drink beer
