Ha
It's Gucci, it's Drop Top
Wizop, whoo
Yeah, ayy 
You get the bag and fumble it
I get the bag and flip it and tumble it 
Straight out the lot, three hundred cash 
And the car came with a blunt in it 
Lil' mama a thot, and she got ass 
And she gon' fuck up a bag 
Pull up to the spot, livin' too fast 
Droppin' the dope in the stash 
In Italy, got two foreign hoes, they DM me 
Drop the top when it's cold 
But you feel the heat 
Be real with me
Keep it 100, just be real with me 
Eat it up like it's a feast 
They say the dope on fleek 
Percocet pill on me 
Ice on my neck, baby, chill with me 
Them niggas that post in the back don't say nothin'
Them niggas will kill for me
Back ends I count in my sleep, on fleek
Hundred K spent on a Patek Phillippe 
Bitch, I'm a dog, eat my treat 
Hop out the frog and leap 
I put them bricks in the fender
My bitch, she walk around like she Kris Jenner 
I used to break in and enter
Then Takeoff runnin' like the game of temple 
It's simple, I play with her mental
Mama said she saw me on Jimmy Kimmel 
Count it up, 'cause I'm a money symbol
Walkin' with the racks, I'm lookin' crippled 
Fuck on that bitch then I tip her 
A nickel for me to take pictures 
Not from L.A. but I clip her 
Double my cup, pour a triple 
Fox on my body, no Vivica 
I'm not your average or typical 
Look at my wrist, and it's critical 
Hold it up, droppin' the temperature 
I get that bag on the regular 
I got a bag on my cellular 
Backin' up, baggin' up vegetables 
Bag of them cookies, it's medical 
Cocaine, codeine, etcetera 
Cocaine and lean, it's federal 
I take off, landin' on Nebula
As of now twenty M's on my schedule 
You get the bag and fumble it
I get the bag and flip it and tumble it 
Straight out the lot, three hundred cash 
And the car came with a blunt in it 
Lil' mama a thot, and she got ass 
And she gon' fuck up a bag 
Pull up to the spot, livin' too fast 
Droppin' the dope in the stash 
In Italy, got two foreign hoes, they DM me 
Drop the top when it's cold 
But you feel the heat 
Be real with me
Keep it 100, just be real with me 
Eat it up like it's a feast 
They say the dope on fleek 
I know that these niggas gettin' sick of me 
These chains on my neck cost a mil' a piece 
I don't even like to freestyle for free
I put in the key and I ride the beat
I won't even come out the house for free
I pay a nigga to drive for me 
JAY-Z couldn't even co-sign for me
I do what I want 'cause I'm signed to me 
I get the, I get the, I get the bag
They get the bag, have to cut it in half 
Stop the comparin', y'all makin' me laugh
Need the rehab, I'm addicted to cash
Convertible Wop, convertible top
My dope got a vertical, look at it hop
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, and it jump out the pot 
Came out of jail and went straight to the top
Take it easy, baby, middle of summer, I'm freezin', baby 
Don't leave me, baby
Just drop to your knees and please me, baby 
I'm fascinated, two bitches so fine that I masturbated 
Congratulations, she brain me so good that I graduated 
They had to hate it
I don't fuck with them niggas, they plastic, baby 
A trapper, baby, I rap but I own all my masters, baby
It's tragic, baby, I pull up and fuck up the traffic, baby 
A savage, baby
I'm killin' these niggas, closed casket, baby 
You get the bag and fumble it
I get the bag and flip it and tumble it 
Straight out the lot, 300 cash 
And the car came with a blunt in it 
Lil' mama a thot, and she got ass

Pull up to the spot, livin' too fast 
Droppin' the dope in the stash 
In Italy, got two foreign hoes, they DM me 
Drop the top when it's cold 
But you feel the heat 
Be real with me

Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, ho, pull your panties up
'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philippe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high

But I'm both right now
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a lil' boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
SouthsideLifestyle on camera 
Hundred thousand dollar chandelier 
They tried to turn me to an animal

My new bitch gon' pull me a new bitch
Then pull me a new bitch

Off like a lay-up , I don't got time to lay up
Met my accountant at Ruth's Chris, she told me that I'm way up

Ran me up a hunned M's and then I put my bay up 
Way out in the hills, I just sign the deal

I'm hearin' shooters loadin' pistols while I'm brushin' my teeth 
I get so many death threats, it's getting normal to me
But I bend, don't break, I don't ask, just take
Black gloves, black tape and I don't play nor pray 
Wake up and take a piss, I hear 'em sharpening knives
Main focus every day is make it out here alive 
Take a shower in my boots and go to sleep in my shoes
Last night, I had a dream some killers ran in my room 
Trying to be patient, but nigga, I can't wait 
Only chance to kill my enemies and beat my case 
So when they ask me how I feel about 'em, I can't say
You either with me or against me or you in my way 
I got a pack of hungry wolves and if I don't feed 'em
Then they might turn on me, feel like I don't need 'em
I keep the best pedigree, but hell, I don't breed 'em 
It's a lot of people scared of me and I can't blame 'em
They call me crazy so much, I think I'm starting to believe 'em
I did some things to some people that was downright evil
Is it karma coming back to me? So much drama
My own mama turned her back on me and that's my mama 
I lost three people close to me in one summer
Ten years later, still don't know shot up my Hummer 
But I bend I don't break, I don't ask I take 
Black gloves and black tape, nigga, it's my first day

Sittin’ down I still stand out
Tall nigga with jewelry on
Like Christmas lights on a damn house
It’s me, and I’m cool with it
You don’t know what to do with yourself
When I do it, I’m doing it fresh
Born to do it, so I do it to death
Calm in the steps, walking my dawgs
We don’t get along, I’m tellin’ ‘em fetch
Hit ‘em like “PA!” Hit ‘em like “PA!”
Shoot up the spot and I’m leavin’ like “Ah!”
Okay, you know I started from scratch
I got to the strip club just to relax
I get a flat tire, I buy a new car
You know what time it is, check the Rolex
If you keep whining, baby, you gon’ lose me
Better choose me, baby, come choose me
So fine that I let the girl use me
But I don’t ever get used up, usually 
Baby use, me – baby, use me
Baby use, me – baby, you can use me

Hah
It's Gucci
Hah
I was piss poor, sleeping on the dirt floor
And we couldn't pay the rent so it's a notice on the door
The neighbors been noticed so what I'ma front for?
Using pennies for the bus like what I'ma stunt for?
Mama workin' like a dog but we still broke
We lighting candles in the house 'cause the lights off
The best thing that ever happened, I got kicked out
Bought me a Chevy, got a grill, now I'm gold-mouthed
I lost my daddy last year, I couldn't even cry
'Cause it's so hard to shed a tear, he didn't even try
The only person in the world I could fully trust
Was my older brother Vic, that's just how it was
Top in the trunk, this for Bankroll and Slim Dunk
I miss that girl Beasley, she was a real one
I had an artist that I treated like my own son
Gave him the shirt off my back and my own gun
R.I.P. to Shawty Lo, Mister Don Don
It's been rainin' so long, when the sun comin'?
I'm drop top but put the top up when the storm comin'
Sometimes I think about my past, it make me start tripping
I was gifted with a talent that was God-given
But I was so hard-headed I would not listen
Sometimes I sit and I reflect about that cold prison
And doin' pull-ups with a nigga got a life sentence
They gave my nigga Grant life, he only gained on me
Five years later, how we in the same room?
You go to jail, that's when you see who really love you
I don't think nobody love me like my auntie Jean do
R.I.P my auntie Jean and uncle Goat too
How you gon' judge me? You don't know what I been through
I think these killers need a hug, I need a hug too
You send a slug, I'll send a slug, you know how thugs do
But I forgive, I been forgiven, I hold grudges too
I'm just a work in progress, I'm not even through
But I forgive, I been forgiven, I hold grudges too
I'm just a work in progress, I'm not even through
Wop
Hah
WooI know God can't be mad at me
Because all the blessing he gave me!
Riding around with my top down I’m looking up at the galaxy 
A lot of girls can’t stand me, They don’t really understand me
Can’t get half of my Phantom, Can’t get half of my mansion
Lost my homie to gunfire, Nigga part of my empire
Ever since that day I’ve been riding late like a vampire
People say I’m a addict, got a lot of bad habits 
I love smoking that broccoli, and I love stacking that cabbage
Shout out to my jeweler, Damn it’s such a good jeweler
Shout out to my shooter, Damn he’s such a good shooter
Every car that I ride, Clean from bumper to bumper
Every time that I slide, Throw my top in the dumpster
I’m OG, yous a youngster, Got more guns then contra
More chains than Busta, and more hoes then Usher
It’s Gucci Mane and Drumma, So that means more commas
I’m hands on like a laptop, Get your cap popped this summer 
Sometimes I, I feel good
I be in the hood, I just ride by
Sometimes I, I feel bad
I be in the hood, Might do a drive-by
Sometimes I, I feel good
I be in the hood, I just ride by
Sometimes I, I be in the hood
And I’m feeling bad, Might do a drive-by
Future got it bad, I’m a drug addict
Woke up seen a UFO, I’m a street fanatic
Money out the roof, I had it in the attic
Flyest nigga on Earth, Astronaut status
Astronomical I’m phenomenal
Money doing flips, I’m talking summersaults
I catch it for a summer, Aggravated assault
Winter time niggas come out with 20 dimes
Feel like I’m on a shroom, All this money in this room
Friday night lights, Chain still swinging
I’m a rock star, and I’m gang banging
Skulls everywhere, Spikes everywhere
Bloodhound for that money, Catch me anywhere
I went to space and left some niggas
I don’t fucking care
I should have went to Yale, The way I move a bail
Death before dishonor, I’ll never tell
Sometimes I, I feel good
I be in the hood, I just ride by
Sometimes I, I feel bad
I be in the hood, Might do a drive-by
Sometimes I, I feel good
I be in the hood, I just ride by
Sometimes I, I be in the hood
And I’m feeling bad, Might do a drive-by
Thank you all for coming out
God bless

A lot of cliques don't get along here
Bricksquad my nig, we rock our own gear 
I'm on the grass, sitting on the lawn chair

Rose gold on my bottom six
Half a mill on foreign whips
I'm in the wheel with a foreign bitch
I'm on the bra strap, and she on this dick
Just bow down, you lame
Your diamonds look strange
I'm grinding like Wayne
When he on that skateboard, I'm saying
Nigga your new girl's my old bitch
My old bitch your new girl
Young lil rich Philly nigga
Them hoes tell me I'm too thorough

Young nigga fresh like Easter
Blood dripping on my sneakers
Straight drop, I stick that

Honorable C-Note
Fluorescent lamps in my crib, providing light for my seeds
I'm a get money marine, I sent coke in submarines
Irrigation machines, hydraulic water machines
My money counting machine sound like a sewing machine
Cash machine on the dresser, machine gun with the compressor
Dope presser machine, I'm re-rocking everything 
Claim I'm laundering money but where the washing machine?
They know my trap house pump out quarters like a slot machine
In a futuristic whip look like a time machine
Old school dropped a lil' one fine machine
Making chips off coke and soda like a vending machine
Dog food with the quinoa in my blending machine
Sip so much Codeine and Sprite I need a soda machine
So I can sit it next to my joint rolling machine
And it's placed parallel to the Carbon 15
With the scope, monkey nuts, and the infrared beam
The machine don't make the man, the man make the machine
So many try to sabotage, can't stop the regime
Call me Wop the puppet master, I'm just pulling the strings
Screaming please don't look me puppet like American Me
Take a tour with me, a down south American G
Tryna flood the dirty south, East Atlantian streets
With this high grade uncut Colombian tea
Yeah I got it for cheap but you ain't get it from me
Got the high grade uncut Colombian tea
Yeah I got it for cheap but you can't get it for free

100 grand in all twenties, they said that I couldn't
50 grand to my bitch just cause her ex was looking
Red bottom boss, I call the yayo caucasian
Choppers sleep on the couch ready for home invasions
These pussies watching my Snap, they know that I'm strapped
On the road to the riches bitches, I'm running my laps

Need a hundred mill', fuck a record deal
Because a couple millions just not enough
Sell your momma a zip of dust

Making money's my hobby, flipping bricks is my passion
Home girl in the lobby, "Is you suckin' dick?" I'm just asking
I ain't mean to be rude boo, but you know I'm that dude, true
More birds than Atlanta Zoo, going in like a curfew
I lost my mind, and my train of thought, and my top all at the same time
If you sendin' them birds across the country, then we probably got the same grind
I'm an OG like my daddy, I'm a hustler like my momma
I'mma stack my bread all winter so I can ball out all summer
Got foreign choppas, Osama, smoke presidential, Obama

Known for toting guns and it's what I'm on probation for
Had a murder charge, but they ain't found me guilty though
Keep my head on a swivel, 'cause I robbed a couple folks
And you can call me anything, but you can't call me broke, though
Was damn near 300 pounds, but I lost the weight, though
300 pounds of mid-grade, I took it 'cross the state, though
Got a bunch of tattoos, don't ask my why I got them, though
Got a lot of loved ones, but they ain't here today, though
Really miss my homeboy, he in a early grave, though

Niggas keep on trying me, I think they feelin' brave, though
People say they cloned me because I changed my ways, though
I fly the dope in on a drone for the pesos
All about the bucks bro, but this ain't Tampa Bay, though
I'm a livin' legend, I do magic with the Draco

Gucci super cutthroat, but I was born broke though
Didn't have a pot to piss, so I wanted to throw it out, so
Niggas talk sideways, I hit him in his mouth though
Who you think you talking to? I had to stomp your mouth, bro
Baby got a pretty face but I just want the mouth though
You ain't come to suck me up, then what you in the house for?
Brand new Air Max and they ain't even out though
Drippin' sauce excessively and it ain't even called for
If the jewelry ain't blindin' me, then what it even about for?
Niggas want to sign to me, but I can't even vouch for
Back to back with Ralo, and we ain't even deep though
How yo clique compare to mines and y'all ain't even street though?

Same time that Dr. Dre said "G Thang"
Damn what another nigga said 'bout me
Why these niggas still worry 'bout me
Buyin' ?? mane on the D-train when the bricks came
Damn I act a fool in the kitchen with my wrist game
Ice on my neck, got a chick and a Vette
And I'm ballin' like a player for the motherfuckin' Jets, mane
Take it to the streets, want a war with a G
Live at the gun range like my name Chief Keef

Coulda lost my sanity, my brain been fried
It's so hard to understand when it's God's plan
And it's not in my hands but in God's hands
Free my nigga Putang and free Papa Joe
And every soldier ten toes who ain't never told

Way baby girl throw it back, old man might catch heart attack
Gucci Mane now hardly there, smack it like I'm mad at that
Sweaty sex, so passionate, oral sex, she mastered that
Pornographic poses like she posin' for the Internet
One hour not finished yet, never been a minute man
Always been a business man, got her catchin' feelings, man

Talkin’ that shit, now you shot in the head
Brick Squad niggas don’t shoot in the leg
Shouts to our fallen, I ball till I fall, and
The neighbors don’t talk ‘cause the neighbors are scared
A white girl, a black girl, a hell of a mix
Rollin’ up kush while they suckin’ my dick
On my team, it’s a tag-team
All my niggas get money
If you get tired, then tag in, then me and your freak’ll start fuckin'
Got two choppers, it’s a tag team
Four bad bitches and it’s all to me
Had to break into like ten houses to ride on these 9x17s
Oops, my fault, that’s your team’s line
I ain’t have time, I was grindin’ real hard
People goin’ crazy, and my mama goin’ crazy but belive it or not, bitch, I gotta thank the Lord
Ballin’ so hard when I came out of jail
Now I'mma get a scene now when the doors up

Like a preschooler, in my garage playing switcharoo 
I park the red one, put the yellow front of the blue 
I had the county blues, now every day I'm counting the blues 
No lean in Mountain Dews, Guwop, I'm so proud of you
Accountants count it, two stacks so tall, got a mountain view 
My house so big, this bitch mistook it for the Fontainebleau 
First time I copped the Deuce, said, "Guwop, I'm so proud of you" 
Guwop still Trap God and they quote me more than Dr. Seuss 
I'm way richer than when I got out three years ago 
I freestyle, don't even write, don't even think no more 
Put the lean down, I don't want it, I don't drink no more 
You ain't my friend, you ain't my round, man, we can't link no more
Ran out of places to tattoo, can't get no ink no more 
Fresh off parole, and I can't go back to the clink no more 
I had the county blues, now every day, I'm countin' the blues 
No lean in Mountain Dews, Guwop, I'm so proud of you 
New clothing line, call it Delantic 
My pinky ring sunk the Titanic 
She say I'm fine, she threw her panties 
The coldest nigga on the planet 
Coupe dropped the top, I call her Janet 
Them boys fell off, it's like they vanished 
Extendo tucked, this bitch gigantic 
I up the strap, them niggas panic 
I'm way richer than when I got out three years ago 
I freestyle, don't even write, don't even think no more 
Put the lean down, I don't want it, I don't drink no more 
You ain't my friend, you ain't my round, man, we can't link no more
Ran out of places to tattoo, can't get no ink no more 
Fresh off parole, and I can't go back to the clink no more 
I had the county blues, now every day, I'm countin' the blues 
No lean in Mountain Dews, Guwop, I'm so proud of you 
Guwop, I'm so proud of you
No lean in Mountain Dews, Guwop, I'm so proud of youYou know I've been searchin' for someone
I've been lookin', hah, for the perfect one
Who could share that special love with me
Mrs. Perfect
And your eyes have that glow
She had that glow though
Could it be?
Could it be your face I see on my computer screen
J. White, I need a beat, I can go off on, ooh
Uh, yeah
Go
I was in the jail thinking 'bout my problems
Like all the niggas, when I get out, I'ma rob 'em 
Shit was hard, up and down, it was '09 
Lookin' through this magazine, she was so fine
Pretty brown, black bitch, what a draft pick
Hot yellow thick chick with an accent 
I told her, "I ain't ever seen another cuter" 
Good brain, she don't even need a tutor 
Fuck a shooter, I'll shoot a nigga's shooter 
Long money, I don't even need a ruler 
A big dawg, I ain't ever been a poodle 
So much ice on my bitch, she need a cooler 
And I disturb the peace like Luda' 
Been droppin' low like you be doin' on that computer
You want a long distance love, I want computer love 
So drop it low and back it back like a computer does 
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop 
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop 
Ooh, when we both logged on, I didn't wanna turn off
That's that computer love 
Hit you up on the laptop 
I told you meet me at the last spot
You went with me, fell in love
Didn't take long for you to gain my trust, no
With all that I've been through, you make it simple
I never thought I would meet an angel
Until I met you, until I met you 
I'ma put you on the rocks 
Nobody fuckin' with the Wops 
Baby give me all that she got
Share it with me, we gon' throw it all in the pot 
This the type of love more than physical 
When a king get a queen, he invincible 
Fought the system every level, it was critical 
Fuck the feds, state, civil, and municipals 
Even then, through computers I was kissin' you 
Remember through the computer, I would visit you 
Daydreamin' 'bout us fuckin' in your living room 
Doin' push ups 'cause I know you 'bout to visit soon 
I'm from the 6, I grew up in the worst trap 
I'm way too rich, bae, to fall for a thirst trap 
Plus I know the grass ain't greener on the other side 
'Cause my house so big, I rarely see the other side 
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop 
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop 
Ooh, when we both logged on, I didn't wanna turn off
That's that computer love

She think her pussy diamond but I don't even want it
Call it perfect timing, I don't have no opponents
It ain't no competition, 'cause they don't really want it
A bitch'll slit her wrist just so she can be my sidepiece
She wanna stand beside me, I just threw up a nine piece
If she thick as a horse I might buy that bitch a Porsche
If she mean nothing to me, Wizop I'm worth a fortune
I do it with no effort like I don't really want it
He say he worth a mil but I got a million on me

Her teeth whiter than a peppermint
I buy her a maid, this and that so therefore she ain't coming back
Babygirl chasing her a sack
Young Thugger Young Thugger, Young Stack is my brother
I fuck her, I love her, but I cannot cuff her
I pull up on donuts, they take all my orders
That lean is my drank and that pussy my supper
I like my bitch brown like dumped in Coca Cola
Her ass keep clapping, Magnolia Magnolia
She walk down that runway, she coming she coming
Ain't talkin' no gun but she don't got no tummy
Got bricks like a mummy

I'm riding in a mansion but I don't think I'm fancy
But I cut the blinker on and my diamonds dancing
Once upon a time, a little while ago
There was a nigga in a 'Rari with a pretty yellow ho
Got my head held up cause I think I'm handsome
But the media portraying me as Charles Manson
And I could have bought a Phantom rode here four deeper
But I'd rather pull up solo in the yellow two-seater

Screaming out "Who wants some Anna?"
Made a million off my words, they in love with my Country Grammar
That's the antenna, but your rapping careers got static in it
I'm a walking meal ticket, just wait a minute

Nigga, fuck it Yeah, this the life I'm livin'Listen to this track, bitch!
I’m my best friend, and I’m my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me unless I let them, is you feeling me?
And misery loves company and I had my share of misery
No mystery, my infamy got me in hip hop history
First 2Pac died, then Biggie died, and that greatly impacted me
Then history repeated itself through me and I made history
So I don’t turn around no more, I look at whats in front of me
I’m focused on the future 'cause yesterday is history
A hard head makes a soft ass
Guess your Ma didn't teach ya that
Pick a spot to beef with me and that spot I will meet you at
Well let me check my schedule
I’m free Tuesday three weeks from now
You bring your crew I bring my crew
Just pick a time and side of town
Zone 6 is my stomping ground
But I guess you know that by now
But everywhere you go you hear me
That's why you're upset right now
Bought a Phantom and a Lamb' but I’m in my 'Vette right now
I raped the game without a rubber, bank accounts are pregnant now
That day they tried to murder me, a day I can’t forget about
And I don't wish no death on homie
Just want him to hear me out
Think about the past and all the many things we talked about
Think of all the people influenced by what comes out our mouth
I’m my best friend, and I’m my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me unless I let them, is you feeling me?
And misery loves company and I had my share of misery
No mystery, my infamy got me in hip hop history
First 2Pac died, then Biggie died, and that greatly impacted me
Then history repeated itself through me and I made history
So I don’t turn around no more, I look at whats in front of me
I’m focused on the future 'cause yesterday is history
I am not the perfect person
May don’t spit the perfect verses
I wouldn’t hurt a girl on purpose 'cause I feel they don’t deserve it
I admit my words can hurt, I dissed Tiny she didn’t deserve it
Our song didn’t interpret it right and I’m sorry for it
T.I. many times encouraged, told me face the game with courage
Clay gave me some great advice and still today I thankful for it
Me, Jeezy, and T.I share one thing in common: all are poets
Role model to young people tho at times man we still ignore it
And y’all gon owe respect to me and I don’t like apologies
Just diss me 'til you satisfied
I swear it doesn’t bother me
Sticks and stones will break my bones and bullets won't reflect off me
But words and insults only show the world how y'all respectin' me
I’m my best friend, and I’m my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me unless I let them, is you feeling me?
And misery loves company and I had my share of misery
No mystery, my infamy got me in hip hop history
First 2Pac died, then Biggie died, and that greatly impacted me
Then history repeated itself through me and I made history
So I don’t turn around no more, I look at whats in front of me
I’m focused on the future 'cause yesterday is history
All my homies ain’t my homies
Half friends no longer want me
I'm still hungry as I was when I did my first live performance
Things I got I know they want it
Things I done, they haven’t done it
Though they say that they my friends
I know that these niggas opponents
We can joke and laugh and party
But I know their smiles are phony
But I still pray that the Lord give 'em all the things they wanted
All the money in the world can’t get the joy I’m felling, homie
Like the third day with a woman like you and not for your money
You can help someone and love someone but still they'll turn and burn you
So I warn you in advance, watch out cause so called friends will con you
Think MJG said it best man will I ever know
Who my friends through thick and thin, cause so called friends will turn to foes
I’m my best friend, and I’m my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me unless I let them, is you feeling me?
And misery loves company and I had my share of misery
No mystery, my infamy got me in hip hop history
First 2Pac died, then Biggie died, and that greatly impacted me
Then history repeated itself through me and I made history
So I don’t turn around no more, I look at whats in front of me
I’m focused on the future 'cause yesterday is historyTwisting fingers in the club, I'm a young nigga

Pants sagging, flag hanging, I'm a young nigga 
Yeah, most my niggas rob, they don't got a job
I got a couple young niggas that’ll take the charge

Where you from, nigga, this one's for the young niggas
Ray Charles vision, screaming where's the competition

Gucci said I'm going hard, Flocka on this shit
Old-school swag, got these hoes on my dick
I'm a lotto pick, I'm like which girl to get

My daughter 4 months, bricks in her pamper
I'm a road master, I love Tampa
You say you from the streets, then I gotta stamp ya

If money through with you then you ain't gonna make it
The streets will give it to you and the streets will take it

I think we make a pair, she like em from the trap
I got her in the chair she think she in the lear
The way I'm switchin' gears, got her takin' off her heels
I'm Mr. Get Her There, take your underwear, you fuckin
With a boss no need for fuckin with a square
I light the weed up, and hit it two times
Smoke is so good I hit it few times
If I hit her once I hit her two times
If I did it once I can do two times
Oh I got a joint burnin here real slow
Wanna slide to my crib lets go I
Show u my double balcony put ur head in my
Lap rite before u start to make out wit me
Crib in L.A I flew her to the south with me
You niggas wanna be players? Well I can show you how to be
I got my salary up now all them bitches say hi to me
I'm smoking loud and these niggas just trying to be as high as me
Another causality I kill every beat, I'm smokin on celery
Only fuck with papers a gang of Taylors on every feet
I don't fuck with them haters cause niggas hate but we never speak
Yo bitch want me to save her u betta tame her of get a leash
Mutha-fucker
I light the weed up and hit it two times
Smoke is so good I hit it a few times
If I hit her once I hit her two times
If I did it once I can do two times

Metro, Wizop
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm 'gon shoot you
I put eight mill' in my crib to inspire ya
When you worth like twenty mill', the kids admire ya
When your rap sheet look like mine, no one will hire ya
But when you sign yourself like I did, they can't fire ya
You want your club so loud then put me on the flier 
I'm on fire like Richard Pryor, my price gettin' higher
How you gon' take my title, drivin' a car without a title?
I'm whippin' through rush hour Charlotte traffic in a Spyder
Slide up on ya bitch like a race car driver
Dive off in that pussy like a deep sea diver
Niggas from my hood know me from cheap, cheap powder
But niggas on your block say you's a real weak coward
High five, low five
I left them niggas hangin', they get no five
Gucci Mane, they say that I got nine lives
Six Flags Over Georgia, I got nine rides
High five, low five
I left them bitches hangin', they get no five
Gucci Mane, they say that I got nine lives
Come go to Gucci World, cause I got nine rides
Fuck yo jam of the week, I put grams on the street
So much money, gave metro a hundred grand for the beat 
So much ice around my bezel you can't see, the Patek
I'm Felipe, in Felipe's, with a freak, she petite
From the beach, to the skreet, from the skreet, to the suite
Put my bone in her mouth, told her bon appétit
I done sold so many keys they should deport me to Belize
Cause I'm shining on these niggas like a desert with no trees
From the hat on my head to the shoes on my feet
Every garment on my body, man, it come from overseas
In them 'partments I was raised I sold like 50,000 P's
You want Gucci on your song, that's at least a hundred G's
Wop
High five, low five
I left them niggas hangin' they get no five
Gucci Mane, they say that I got nine lives
Six Flags Over Georgia, I got nine rides

I'm tryna figure which chick I'ma see today 
Picked up a young girl, looked like Lisa Raye 
When I seen her in the club, said I gots to get her 
'Cause she look like she might be Trina sister 
Got a girl that look just like Lauryn Hill 
Took her to the crib 'cause she know what it is 
Love her mama, but I can't stand her daddy, though 
But she got more ass than Jacki-O 
Got a brown-skinned girl like Foxy Brown 
Bought a quarter-pound just to blow it down 
Tattoos all over like Eve or somethin' 
Long hair, but it must be weave or somethin' 
Gotta surprise, so I bought her new furniture 
'Cause she pretty in the face like Monica 
I really dig the girl
So I gave her a ticket to Gucci World 
Go 'head , go 'head

I got that fire red thong and the bra to match 
I'm a real boss bitch and I'm hard to catch
Mac Bre-Z, pimpin' ain't easy, nigga 
You can leave me 'cause I don't really need ya, nigga 
I got a Chevy and you hear me 'fore ya see me, nigga 
'Cause my mama showed The Mac how to treat a nigga
And I'm a top notch bitch that talk shit, but I take none 
Hair stay fixed, jump fresh with my nails done 
My bracelet make niggas sick, so you already know
That when I step up in the club, I'll be rockin' stilettos, ho 
I'm a jazzy girl, a straight classy girl 
And you'll never hear a nigga say I'm nasty, girl 
And you'll never meet a girl that'll shine like me 
'Cause I'm with the Gucci Mane and I'm so icy 
Go 'head , go 'head 
Go 'head , go 'head

Them niggas jealous, say you ain't got time for that 
All that shake, can a nigga get some fries with that? 
Too much ass, I ain't got no place to hide it at 
Hair blonde for a minute 'til she dyed it black 
In the club with her girls, everybody pretty 
Say she used to dance at Magic City 
Go, girl , to the flo', girl 
Shake it real slow like a pro, girl 
Hit the 'dro, girl , 'cause it's your world 
Dance one time, then get some more girls 
Gucci in the club, two rubber band banks 
Smokin' bubba kush and the shit just stanks 
Six girls dancin' at the same time

Act so , I should order some cargo
European auto, Instagram model
Drankin' out the bottle, heard she like to swallow
Gucci Mane a model, snakes all on my collar
Brand new Winnebago, lay low with the yayo
Yellow bone chicano, her brother call me Gato
These kicks ain't one day old, one rock then they retro
On your marks, get set, go, I'm racin' with a peso
Rainbow with the crayons, they red, blue, green and yellow
If you hang out with narcos, then I can be your partner
I live by the G-code, my paper work proper

I deliver bundles, I'll take over your city 
Chopper fully-auto, I'll smoke you like some midgie
Bullets big as potholes, they'll merk you while I'm pissin'
CEO, I'm honcho, got twenty-five assistants
My bricks came with a barcode, but I don't sign to get it
Don't fuck no more you broke ho, give her to my assistance
That wig she got on so old, gave her two stacks to fix it
I'm a desperado, free all the desperados
Twenty years been back home, he still got his bravado
My homeboy from Michoacán, tequilla out the bottle
You ain't on what Gucci on, a hundred million dollars

I take the good with the bad, and the bad with the good
The plug sent the goods, so I had to flood the hood
The plug sent the bag, then I offed that too
That made me a bigger asset to the plug
But tell me how you feel when your plug tell on ya
Your partner in crime, own thugs tell on ya
Talking 20 years, 30 years, 50 years
In the cell feeling drunk like you drunk 80 beers
Homicide though, genocide when I ride
When we die, only God know where the bullets fly
In my Hummer truck, bullets coming through my car door
I got contract killers staying at my condo
Got a hole up your folk cause they sure ain't bluffin'
Gotta vest up cause I sure ain't ducking
Standing in the cold on the corner, Flat Shoals
Sold his soul to the devil for a Mac-11
100 bricks of pure coke, white like heaven
My Mexican, Catholic connect doing confession
Sitting in the pen, son just turned seven
I progress then regress and this shit is getting depressing
But I count my stash 'fore I count my blessings
And I load my weapon 'fore I eat my breakfast
The skreets keep talking and the snitches keep telling
Your whole life can change in a motherfucking second
Out the cage in a rage like I escaped out the zoo
They playing games with me when they know that I'm a fool
Set it off like Queen Latifah, give me the loot or I'ma shoot
You nincompoops so rude-a-poo, you tuti-fruit, you through
I'm an animal, a cannibal, they say I'm on the loose
Animal, a cannibal, they say I'm on the loose
Gucci Mane La Flare, you prolly seen me on the news
Out the cage in a rage like I escaped out the zoo
I might manic, I go in a panic, don't see nothing but red
Off my meds, I can't sleep cause I hear voices in my head
This lil devil on my left shoulder say "shoot him in the dreads"
While an angel on the right whisper "just shoot him in the leg"
I admit that I might need some help, I guess I made a step
Man they think I need a shrink cause I fear God but don't fear death
I'm so selfish, I bought 80 pints to drink 'em by myself
A swimming pool full of drank, I dive in like I'm Michael Phelps
Louis glasses, Ferragamo belt, I'm Gucci Mane XL
YSL with the new Gazelles that match my blue Chevelle
Bitches laughing like I'm Dave Chappelle cause I stay fresh as hell
Zone 6, Zone 6. You don't like it? Kill yourself
Out the cage in a rage like I escaped out the zoo
They playing games with me when they know that I'm a fool
Set it off like Queen Latifah, give me the loot or I'ma shoot
You nincompoops, so rude-a-poo, you tuti-fruit, you through
I'm an animal, a cannibal, they say I'm on the loose
Animal, a cannibal, they say I'm on the loose
Gucci Mane La Flare, you prolly seen me on the news
Out the cage in a rage like I escaped out the zooI'm obnoxious, I'm flowing crazy, I need to stop this
Don't knock this, you niggas lazy ya'll need to watch this
Preposterous if you can fathom how you can block this
My phantom was seen on Candler, you ride the transit
No options you niggas can't act like ya'll forgot this
I'm tired but switch ya flow up, it's so monotonous
It's my metropolis, I'll drop a 12 on ya so colossus
My swag plus my drop top yellow jag why they gossip
I'm the nigga upload your twitter, bitch I'm the topic
Profess it but Gucci didn't graduate from college
Your girlfriend says my ear rings are erotic
My lambo doors open upward they're robotic
It's Gucci
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
Birds in the living room, it's like Atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks, crocs, and gators for my shoes
Monkey niggas in my hood, I'm living in the zoo
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too
I'm a tiger in the bedroom, ask your baby boo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo 
Drop beam, off set things, color ice cream
White dreams, she can fuck me, that's a pipe dream
X-O, poppin' x-pills so exciting
My ex chick and ex homeboy uninvited
Cases of Ace of Spade, bitch getcha wasted
The waitress, I made her reload it like the Matrix
I lean laid with a bad bitch Black and Asian
On 20, headed to Buckhead, I'm racing baby
But take that fake jewelry off, that shit is fugazi
You think that you're hotter than the kid you're mistaken
Real and you niggas really really good at fakin'
So trill, I'mma keep it real, I'm back to the basics
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
Birds in the living room, it's like Atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks, crocs, and gators for my shoes
Monkey niggas in my hood, I'm living in the zoo
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too
I'm a tiger in the bedroom, ask your baby boo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo 
Heads up, my partner stashin' bricks up on his roof top
Whole key, half a key, quarter key
Gucci got more quarters than a motherfuckin' juke box
Pop-pop hear the Glock cock, and I gotta Colt 45 like Billy D
Semi automatic that I keep up in the attic and a shank that shape like Tennessee 
I cut ya, I cut ya to the white meat
And my partner pushin' more crack than a bike seat
I smoke the best, I get my dro from California
Get high and go to sleep you couldn't wake me from a coma
I might wake up if these rappers got beef I smell the aroma
But these niggas ain't got no heart not even if they had a donor
I roam the streets, so who the fuck is you?
Southside, Collipark, king of the jungle
My name is Ludacris, living in Atlanta zoo
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
Birds in the living room, it's like Atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks, crocs, and gators for my shoes
Monkey niggas in my hood, I'm living in the zoo
Birds in the living room and the kitchen too
I'm a tiger in the bedroom, ask your baby boo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too
But my gun can stop an elephant just like Atlanta zoo What's happening?

Stop that track to tell my children that I'm proud of them
Making rockstars out of trap boys
And if we never talk again, still got your back boy
This here is bigger than the game, deeper than rap, boy
Just ask around in East Atlanta, I'm the landlord
Fuck a contract, I'd rather shake your hand boy
Yeah I'm your CEO but I'm your biggest fan boy
Said I'm the best A&R that's in the business 
But there's an AR-15 in my bentley

Guwop, proud poppa, went and got you your first chopper
Show stopper, globe trotter, all I get is more dollars
Gucci got more money than all these rappers
Guwop got more money than all these trappers
I can take a dope boy and make him go platinum
But how a drug dealer from East Atlanta go platinum?
Master P, '93, mixed with a lil Eazy-E
Dancing in the video like Puff cause I got plenty G's
Family, you sign with me

I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird

Geeked up, she can't even talk
Damn, it's all my fault
Got me nervous 'cause she took a molly
She can't even walk
High as fuck, we can't even fuck
Throwed up on my Chucks
Just my luck that I caught a slut
Can't even mother
Fell asleep and woke up
With a model when you came
And she shake like a Coke bottle
Baby, what's your name?
Reminiscent, got me thinkin'
Damn, Guwop, I'm off the chain
Fucked so many famous bitches
But I'm scared to name they names
There's so many drugs I lost my mind
But I'm not ashamed
I grew up sellin' cocaine
In love with Mary Jane
Pay attention, this non-fiction
I couldn't even make it up
Drinkin' lean like I'm Pimp
One day, I might not wake up
A description of a young black man
Trappin' with a pistol
Wanna kill just like Tony did
When Manny fucked his sister
Monkey nuts on a Glock .40
I can go gorilla
So I'll point, he said 12 comin'
I done peeped the signal
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words
Maybach Music
My Bentley ridin' on Timbalands

Burnin' weed in the Benjamin
Really high on my adrenaline
40 points, 10 assists
Game over, hit or miss
Mary J, they reminisce
Bitch niggas been on the list
One stack and the guns clap
Run the label like I run the trap
All sauce like I'm on the Perc'
Biggest boss with the warmest verse
Ladies stunned when I'm on the scene
Biggest guns, glowin' Bs
Homies had to kill for your charm
I gave the chain back to your mom
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words

Hustlers love me, all the haters hate me
They brothers wanna fight me, they sisters wanna date me
I tell her bust it baby, you could be my bust it baby
But stay in your place, I need my space: don't suffocate me 
Back black approach us, clack clack take gats out the holsters
Cops in black the patrol us, treat us like rats and roaches
But the blue Benz, Got the blue lamps
And your wifey, well we use her for her food stamps
Ain't no big deal, but she keep the fridge filled
Eggs scrambled, cheese grilled, cold juice the grits kill!
Don't forget veal, Italiano, Gallardo

W-I-Z-O-P, Wizop
Hmm, start over
I'm the T-R-A-P-G-O-D
In the A with an FNH on me

Eight hunnid got a nigga whole safe on me
And I'm marching with the bands, FAMU on me
It's a battle of the bands in the VIP
And she say she go to Clark but she dance at Tease
I dare anybody here to put their hands on me
Put the stick up, kids want to kidnap me
Got a SIG on me, are you kidding me?
A little freak lied and tried to put a kid on me
And my own homeboys called the pigs on me
But my faith got stronger and my money grew longer
Sold all my artists now, Gucci Mane a fucking loner
I'm a part-time​ rapper, I'm a full time owner
Breaking rules and bending corners, crack your head with a Corona
Wop!
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces

I got a FNH on side of me
Case my enemies feel they want to ride on me
'Bout to throw up in this club, all this Ace inside of me
Bad bitch in front of me, these weak hoes can't front on me
Ugly hoes can't sell pussy, rich niggas can't fuck for free
Barely standing in VIP, we run off in luxury
Throwing money ain't nothing to me
I'm just giving these broke hoes something to see
2Pac, "All Eyez On Me," 2 Chainz, yeah, "Feds Watching" me
2 Live Crew, Gucci two times, hit one too many bitch and I might be
Haters talking don't worry me, all they do is encourage me
I'm a worldwide executive, neighborhood celebrity
And ain't nothing in this world gon' stop me from getting currency
These bad bitches cherish me, lil' niggas look up to me
Put my AP and my Rollie on when they bury me
Scared of me, you better be, tell me who ain't heard of me
I just offed another hundred piece, bought a watch for eighty G
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces
When it all falls apart, we pick up the pieces
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces

My life is a jugg, my momma, she jugg

Rest in peace to Lante, he died making the jugg
Free my nigga Tay, he made sure, the whole hood good
I met my nigga Gucci Mane, I was making the jugg
They gave me jugger of the year cause I jugg so good
You can't jugg, jugg-man, I cut off your hand

I woke up in Juggland, what a great feeling
House full of Mexicans, nothing but drug dealing
Mi casa su casa Vato!, that's a jugg house

No bother cook powder brotha
We mix work like Spinderella
Black brick, white brick, salt and pepper
Yellow Maz and mozzarella
Shook house push three tons a day
While Molly sayin' who wanna get, we on the street but on the beat
Ran off on him I used my feet, Atlanta Hawks, Miami Heat
These Christian Lubs cost thirty-three
That's thirteen times your twenty-three
I still can cook the dope, remember the shit just like my A-B-C's
A-B-C, nigga, 1-2-3 - that 3-2-1 with a M-16
Billion everyday, everyday's a jugg
Juggin' everyday, gotta meet my plug
Hit the trap up, make sure my work is good
Run off with that work, get left in the woods
Finessin' you out your work, get robbed in my hood
Drivin' real dirty tryna make a couple juggs
30's and F-Ns all under my hood
Got my money all in my pocket, you reach for it I'm poppin'
Ballin' like those stuntin, shooters with me, they thirsty

Your bitch want me, can't afford it
Kill a nigga for my fortune

Hmm, this is what your bitch look like
When you make two hundred thousand dollars cash one night
This is what your wrist look like
When you sold so many bricks that your fit turn white
That shit that you can step on twice
If you've never been a snitch this what your rep look like
And this is what your house look like
When you built it from the ground, paid that ten mil price, ayy
And this is what a king look like
Got a queen on your team, this what the ring look like 
This is what a dream look like
If you're hating tell me what your self esteem look like
Ex-dealer but I left that life

Pretty please get them broke niggas way from me 
I don't want no bitch to fuck with me for free 
You know a rich nigga can't fuck no hoe for free 
I just made five hundred thousand in my sleep 
Money comin', I think it's in love with me 
I'm in the club throwin' money on the freaks 
It ain't 'bout money then no need for us to speak 
Long pipes, big rims, baby that's my life
When I pull up to the club better stash your wife
Hear a lot of haters talkin', they ain't 'bout that life
2017, nigga I done boost the price
Two shows one day, I done switched the ice
Gettin' head on a PJ, it's an all night flight
Call Forbes, tell them niggas what that list look like
'Cause if Guwop ain't on that bitch, then that list not right
I dropped the top so I could show her what the sky look like
Besides the nigga drivin' there's not a star in sight
I just might pull up, pop a wheelie on an all-chrome bike
Bought a diamond grill from my dog, told him to bark, don't bite
Guwop how much you pay for that Patek Phillipe? 
Pretty please get them broke niggas way from me 
I don't want no bitch to fuck with me for free

I was born broke but now I'm successful, I'm special When I first started back in 1995
I wasn't moving keys, I was buying 1.5's
I started coming up, junkies recognized my face
Paid a quarter million dollars just to beat a murder case
They used to run up on me be like, "Gucci, what you know?"
I tell them, "Get this glass, and get the fuck away from me ho!"
And everywhere I go, it became an instant cut
Cause they knew had them 20's and them big fat monkey nuts
Can't be scared of the dark when you come from Mountain Park
Shooting dice and playing cards, selling blow all at the park
Had a crush on your sister, but I used to serve your mama
Breaking 50s down to dimes was my job for the summer
And my job for the winter cooking bricks all in the kitchen
Junkies dead at the car wash cause I heard that they was snitching
Dope jumping out the gym, man it helped me buy my Timbs
Dope fiend Willie used to finger fuck my rims
Smokers didn't know my name so they used to call me Black
If you beep me for a 20, bet ya I'mma call you back
She on the dope man dick cause I'm a nigga with a sack
I'm the hustler of the year, and I know that for a fact
Price so low that they call me thrift store
Standing at the store and I'm selling yayo
Bought a brick yesterday, got a 4-way to go
On the 5-way, everything gotta go
50 on the table, 100 on the floor
Middle of the summer, bruh I'mma make it snow
Like a Chia Pet, my money gon' grow
Still serving niggas through my burglar bars door
Jordace Jeans and a little afro
8-Ball jacket and a pair of Stan Smiths
I don't deal credit, that's how niggas get killed
And if you gotta tip, then your car getting peeled
17 going to the 5-5-9
Like a blind man, I don't see no lying
13 when a nigga did his first crime
18 when a nigga bought his first 9
If I'm lying, I'm flying, and I show ain't flying
Cooking up dope cause the J's keep buying
Robbers do lurk and I know they trying
Try Gucci Mane and you gon' be dying
Let me take you back in time
Let Gucci Mane refresh your mind
I'm a dope boy, stay on my grind
A good plug is so hard to findIf you need somebody say "Yeah yeah"
And if she love somebody, say "Hell yeah"
I can't even lie, baby girl you super cool
And I got a crush on you just like first day of school
Every time I bought some shoes, I bought your ass some shoes
Every time I bought some Trues, you got a pair of Trues
And you left me by myself, now girl I'm so confused
Tell me why you do the things, you do the things you do
I like the way you walking when you walk, the way you move
Ain't no secret 'bout it baby, that's what made me choose
One girl ain't enough for me but fuck that shit, I'm straightenin' up
Them bitches know shit 'bout me, them hoes just wanna break us up
Come on girl, let's fall in love cause I'm so tired of being tough
This might be beginners luck and I don't wanna fuck it up
I'mma get your hair fixed baby just so I can mess it up
Grab that skirt when you get off of work so we can dress it up
I'mma be here thick and thin and God gon' keep on testing us
I said I wouldn't do it again but I just keep on messin' up
If you need somebody, say "Yeah yeah"

I pour a deuce, he half a pint
His blunt big as Godzilla's fingers 
1017 compulsive drinkers
If you cross that line, then your ass in danger
All I hang around is bangers 
I'm a gangsta', rollin' gangsta
Drive a Murciélago, dippin' blunts on camera 
Got a fist full of weed and she swallowin' my seed
But don't call her right now, 'cause the bitch can't answer
Got a double cup full of breast cancer 
I'm dropping my top like a dancer 
These niggas play king, 'cause they king of the castle
But I'm the new king of Atlanta 
Every time you see me, I'm a stoner 
Every time I see her, I'ma bone her 
Every time you see me, I'm a stoner

These niggas don't really want problems 
I come through your set with that carbon
Your children won't have them no father 
You know Young Thug's not gonna argue 
Got 500 rounds, I shoot longer 
I come out my shirt, these bitches know I'm tatted
Tattoo artist charged with arson 
Got one strapped to my knee 
I spend racks on that lean 
I know I'm your bitch's dream 
She got a big cat, no kitty 
Young Thugga get high as a ceiling 
I'm the reason she tell you: “No feelings” 
I know that you mad at her, she just wanna grab on us
And her teeth white like Alka Seltzer Plus 
I know she put me somewhere in her will 
She want my pickle, you know we make deals 
I pay her electric bill, eel
I need that lean, where is Phil? 
I want that lean, I need that lean 
Promethazine, and that Codeine
That's Easter pink, that's Easter pink 
If I got none, I don't have no dreams 
Every time you see me, I'm a stoner

Old heads tripping cause they asking me to front on them
Come short on my one time, and I fuck with them young'uns
All balls, no brains; niggas know I'm ignorant
Understand and get zeroed when put in that predicament
The cars ride up and down the avenue in daytime
Nighttime the same thing -- niggas finna pay mine
Duck off with my motherfucking dope, you got some long nuts
I burn niggas' hoods down, I shoot up they dope cuts
Niggas call me Scarface cause I gave them a reason to
All you get is one chance and then I come get even, fool
Moving them grams, and I ain't thinking bout Grammys
Got so hot in Atlanta, I had to move to Miami
Going honey baked H.A.M., got my trap house whamming
Just ran up on the plug, I brought the food to the family
We say hello to drugs, we don't say no to drugs
Like No Limit C-Murder, making moves with the dubs
Like I'm moving them birds, I got em for sale
Just like Revenge of the Nerds, I got a roomful of squares
The Feds looking at me -- get some glasses, my nigga
They say I make it hot -- I make it happen, my nigga

I'm 'bout them racks like Venus , but I don't play no tennis 
My smile done brought me millions , so shoutout to my dentist 
You lightweight, get your weight up , and stay out Gucci business 
There's sharks out here, don't get ate up , I'm not really friendly 
You haters get your hate up , you ants couldn't even pinch me 
I own the team I play for , so you could never bench me

They ridin' 'round looking for people to rob 
I reminisce about the day I got robbed 
Ain't ashamed to say I got robbed 
It's a beautiful day, someone gon' get robbed 
They ridin' 'round looking for people to rob

So if I'm crazy, then it ain't my fault
I reminisce about the day I got robbed 
Ain't ashamed to say I got robbed 
It's a beautiful day, someone gon' get robbed 
They ridin' 'round looking for people to rob

I remember when I hit my first lick 
Door came off with the first kick 
I had a chick named Angel so thick
She watched me come up from a crumb to a brick
I know that karma is a bitch, real shit 
But I don't rob one nigga, I rob cliques
The niggas I came up with got no sense 
Break in your house, ask them they don't know shit 
They snatch you up and make you call your folks

So conceited that if she ain't worth talking to then I'm not speaking
I'm so single, ay let's mingle
Can I buy you some champagne?
And my sex game gladiator
Tell me, are you entertained?
I'm an entertainer, baby, but my name ain't Cedric
I got cheddar and etcetera, so stop the rhetoric
But enough about me, baby
Sweetie, tell 'bout yourself
Are you married or divorced?
Don't gotta tell me, that's your choice
I like your voice, I like your swagg
So let nature take its course
Maybe in the future, gorgeous, I can buy your ass a Porsche 
Don't be shy, you and I
Me and you can be as one
I can't lie, won't deny
Every time with you is fun
In Dubai, London, Paris, baby, we can watch the sun
Set and rise or just lay back on the beach and watch the sky
She's been sent to me, lent to me
I feel she is God's gift to me
It's Gucci Mane on the mic
While Zay control the symphony
No twisting it, she switching it
But she not all promiscuous
It's obvious she's marvelous
And wants to be a part of this
I give her 1,000%, but this that 50/50 shit
I'm wealthy and I'm healthy
So cut off that boy you kicking with

Her ex-boyfriend is past tense
I talk to her, I listen to her
Text her then she text me
I rap to her, she walks to me
And damn her walk is sexy
Our last night was so good
I think about her next day
More butts than 4 ashtrays
She told me "boy, you crazy"
Burning all my candles and lighting all my incense
I'm giving her my imprint

She said I’m ten times richer than her last man
I get like 50 thousand dollars on the back in
But fuck that, shop with me you know I got them bags in

Handled my business, I swear that I hustled relentless
Bipolar from all of the killings 
Dope I was whippin', Ma tried to whip me 
She gave me a fifty for Christmas , I flipped it 
Still can't forget it, wearin' my brother's clothes I couldn't fit in 
We still got evicted 
Car was so raggedy, it was embarrassin'
It was impairin', I'm blamin' my parents
Rode on Macleans before the McLaren 
I had them starin' all down Maynard Terrace 
Did it myself, ain't no blemish on my rep 
You can come see for yourself 
Watch where you step, mumblin' under your breath
I'll hold a grudge 'til the death

Remember them days  I was stuck in the creek 
I had somewhere to sleep, but I didn't have a bed 
Jumped off the porch, I wasn't going for shit 
Had to tackle the block just to get me some bread 
I was the man of the house, had to figure shit out
Every time Pops went to the feds 
Had a deuce-five with no clip, I was bustin' that bitch

Blood or crip, give a damn, I hit one
If you don't have a gun then you better go get one
One of them nights when I don't wanna fight
Put your hands on me and I'm ending your life
Sit to my left 'cause you know that ain't right
Call me Tyron 'cause you know that ain't right
I'm the type of nigga that get in a fight by the end of the night
They be reading my rights
I got the right to shoot your ass on sight, I got the right to put an end to your life
If they rob you once, they'll rob you twice

Backdoor nigga, leave 'em sick, bird flu 
Sell 'em in the tooth, next flick buy it cool
You saying fuck me, pussy nigga, no, fuck you 
I'm still selling nigga on the blocks with rocks 
Rule number one: don't fuck with the cops 
Fifty for a show, eighty-thousand for the watch 
I'm a real game spitter, shawty slicker than a fox 
With a phone call, boy, I can get you hit 
My niggas hold pistols like they legit 
Send them killer at your ass, better hope they miss
You ain't 'bout that life, you just popping shit
I see through the mist all the snakes in the grass 
Dropped out of school, still above my class 
Real right now, even realer in my past 
You don't like what I become, shorty kiss my ass
I'm my own boss, that's why these niggas mad 
Phantom ghost, paid it all cash, that's why they mad
Haha, squad, squad, squad, Flocka
On a night like this, on a night like this 
On a night like this , man, a nigga get killed on a night like this

Because I'm rich as fuck
No petitioner my peninsula
Imma finish her perpendicular
Whats a pencil for?

Get the rental car
I'm not into her
Talking shit to her
Strapped with a suit like a minister
I'm sinister, grab your sister dismember her
Dropping damage on screamin fuck the law
Smoking out the jar
Hating on me ain't gone get you very far
And my doors ajar, fucked your mom
Woke up in a jar
If I fucked her raw, coulda been ya pa'
Shining like a star
You a fraud
Made the crowd applaud
Gotta thank the lord
For my boy, brick squad
Money over broads
Mob shit mob shit
Get a nigga wild quick
All my niggas hittin licks
All my bitches sell bricks
Mob shit Mob shit
Get a nigga robbed quick
All my niggas hittin licks
All my bitches sell bricks
You nigga leaving with the ones
I can't indulge in that
The bitch try to hug me I won't hug her back
I can walk through this bitch for like 35 racks
Promoter say he never seen a club so packed
I got racks on racks I got tatts on tatts
Think I took steroids when you check my stats
A 20million dollar bitch when I met my match
Rolling stone where my homies lay I laid my hat
Fuck a home got a ??? with 15 straps
15 people dealing gotta sell this crack
Cold hard as the ??? that is on my lap
A weak link in the chain holding too much slackHe's so hood, he's so damn hood
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
Come help me mow yo lawn, mama, turn you up into a soldier
Head to the dreams, and your pretty legs on my shoulders
So don't lie to me I know you're scared of me
You ain't gotta be, cuz I'll have yo back as long as you stay on top of me
First I let her drive me , then I make her ride me 
She change her hair like every day like she miss Dennis Rodman
Say paying wit yo waist, shit, she can overcharge
Still rough around the edges, but money's not a problem
Take it to the hood, move out the hood, but I park the booth, got a pocketbook
Then I call the jeweler, bring the cooler, make it look like Gucci look 
Shawty got a mean swag, I wanna fuck with her
She don't need no lame nigga
She need a thug nigga
I ain't gotta worry about nothing
He's makin' trouble, always give me something
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
Down, keep it so right, and he do it good
I'm too hood for my own good
But we can ball to the mall down, it's all good
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
Crazy guy, but too hood for his own good
She know I like to smoke, love to gamble
I'm in my hood sittin' low in my Lambo 
And we can be a duo, a tandem
Come through Atlanta in back to back Phantom
Her mama like he ain't got no manners
But her mama like "damn, Gucci, handosme"
It's a date night, yeah I got my cake right
The diamonds in the air, flashin' brighter, that's some brake lights
No I'm not a trouble maker, I just make it double take 
Shawty staring at me, but it's something make her hesitate
Maybe it's my reputation, maybe it's my entourage
I'm straight out the hood, but ain't no need to try to camouflage
She ain't gotta worry 
I hold it down, she too much for you suckers
She's hanging off in jewelry all on her
And all the girls want him, so you can tell them nothin
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
He's so hood, he's too hood for his own good
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
Crazy guy, but too hood for his own good
Keep it til' you die, but you can't be sick
Start rootin' for it, can't put it down like this
Find them in the , find them in the 6
Find them in the air, somewhere in the bricks
Keep it til' you die, but you can't be sick
Start rootin' for it, can't put it down like this
Find them in the room, find them in the bay
Find them in New York, find them in L.AI got a pocket full of dead people
Evil voices in my head tellin' me go get this bread

And I love sellin' cake pies
It's a bad bitch in my bed and she got that stupid head
Got me Versace, shop, shawty, catch me walkin' out of 5ths
With a lit Glock 40 and a couple extra clips
Lenox Mall in the closet, all my hoes exotic
And ain't that shit ironic that my doors go up, robotic?
I can walk the shit and I can talk the shit
I can talk the shit cause I got it
It's Gucci Mane, I'm a walkin' lick
Got dead people in my pocket
Fallin' off in Follie's, got a bag full of the mollies
A half a mil' off profit, and my Muller got her jockin'
I got a pocket full of dead people
Evil voices in my head tellin' me go get this bread
Got a pocket full of dead people
Evil voices in my head tellin' me to get this bread

I've been livin' like a king all week
I'm a peasant at the end of every day
I've been chillin' with my niggas in the streets
Livin' like a vagabond, wild, free, run away
Reminiscin' 'bout them bored summer days
Blowin' haze on the east side of Atlanta
Makin' moves on the shawty, a Hispania
We don't speak the same language so excuse me if I stammer
I understand you wanna pick up  the hammer
And build up your own, she see her brother climbin' the ladder
It's your time, yeah it's somethin' that you figure
I mean you can do it too but you can't be a bitch ass nigga
Get up off your ass, find a fuckin' craft
Make bread, get it back, give it back times 2
Who are you? Look in the mirror
Don't give a fuck what they think, you're the one, you're the truth
Got the juice, got the juice, got the juice, got the juice
Mothafucka you the man like an 8th grade Jew
You can chew through any zebra ass in the zoo
Any nigga tryna act hard as some leather boots, fuck them
And anyone tryna step on you, fire burnin'
Nigga learnin', stay concernin' bout your paper
Now and later ain't really good time
For a nigga 'bout his business on Wood Crest Manor
I got a pocket full of dead people
Evil voices in my head tellin' me go get this bread
Got a pocket full of dead people
Evil voices in my head tellin' me to get this bread

Your album came out, I rated it "worst". Response: I hated it
Boyz In The Hood, got juice and rock jewelry
Cars "Fast And Furious", shout out to my boy Ludacris
Supafly, High School Higher Than an Eagle eye

Trafficking like Bailey, bricks coming across the border line
Bust a brick, he tell her: "Sniff", then she say that: "It’s party time"
It’s frightening and scary so they say I've got a horror mind
Gucci Mane not Stephen King but my car crazy like Christine
Rolls - Mary's baby born young and broke in 1980

I needed folks, they left me dead, they kicked me, I was down 
Picked myself up off the ground, the blue cheese bailed me out 
My bank roll is on gout right now, so sick, can't leave the house 
Some leeches tried to ride my wave, but all of them wiped out 
My house so big I got lost, couldn't even find my way around

Dick rock hard, it's up to something
Work on me like Doc McStuffins

Her ex was a minute man
Two minutes, already done
Gucci Mane, I'm super rich
Bitch gotta be super thick
She pulled up, took off the trench
Nothin' on but some Louboutins
Beatin' it up, I'm talkin' shit
Bottom bitch, that's Gato bitch
All this dick, it got to fit
She gargled it and swallowed it
Slapped that ass, I left a print
She's lovin' it, it's obvious
Cocaine sex, I brought a brick
To numb out her esophagus
Shawty got a face like a model
And a frame like a Coke bottle

Late night kissing and touching
Waterfall, she so gushy
Beat it from the side, she bustin'

I remember recordin' in Zay' mama basement
Way, way, way before he ever had a placement 
Dead bodies in the bando, we called it a vacant 
Smokin', drinkin', sellin' dope but I was on probation 
Turned into a killer soon as I left my Cecilia 
I don't think they feel ya 'til the ghetto try to kill ya' 
Free my niggas in the system, motherfuck the system
If you a snitch, fuck you and who snitchin' with ya 
Loan money walk, let the lady take her picture 
Not every day the bitch see a million dollar nigga 
Hired killers with me now, I can't be a victim 
Choppa close by all the time, I'm buckin' the system
Diamonds precious, but nothin's more precious than wisdom 
The fresh is in the buildin', bless the ghetto-children 
Fronted me to pack, I ain't pound 'em back, I'm buckin'
Been known to buck the system, call the plug and told 'em, "Fuck 'em"
Pockets swole for parole, I feel is an injustice
For me to be broke and strugglin', I can't be out hustlin' 
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin'
I'm buckin', I'm buckin', I'm buckin' the system

Hundred round discharge, writin' on the clipboard
Put you in the coffin, I bought a new fit for it
Bite a nigga apple , MacBook laptop
Droptop, MAC-11, ridin' with the strap out
Got my own blueprint, guess I got it mapped out
Just was on Carolina, standin' in the trap house
Said I wouldn't be shit, think I didn't hear about it
Now a nigga clip cost bigger than your real house
I get on a helicopter blindfold to Mexico
You pull up to meet a middle man at Texaco
Breadwinner safeguard, run off on who?
You gotta send the money 'fore the load come through
Nigga Peewee League, pay with peewee cheese
I be overseas, I'm in Medellín with it
If you takin' my lick, I got felonies, nigga

Shot up my truck in East Atlanta
Want to set me up
Bbecause I tricked this nigga in Savannah
They put some money on my head
I had to move to Alabama
Started poppin' with my cousin
Mixing 'caine with Arm & Hammer
Somebody blooded my face badly
My last visit to the slammer
But they put me in that hole
Because I beat him like a hammer
The shooter shot my nigga Juice
A couple times over by Gresham
Wish I was there just to help him
He pushed on, so I respect him
Before the fortune and the fame
Deep in the game, me and my gang
Behind my rights to getting my record
They tried to murk me for my chain
Two tear drops under my eye
Because I wish some days I could cry
But to lose my self-respect
My nigga, I would rather die. Gucci!

Successfully keeping my cool

Don’t you think we handsome?True story
I used to hate Christmas
For real
On the first day of Christmas, my true love sent to me
A half of a brick, told me feed my family
I took it to the hood, then I dropped it in the sink 
Then I whipped it into a whole thing
Jumped off the porch early, man it was '93
I had old hoes on my dick when I was 13 
On the second day of Christmas, I bought an MC
Supersport and I set it on G’s
Wopped so many niggas had to paint that bitch green
I'm the Grinch that stole Christmas, nigga ask about me
On the third day of Christmas, my old plug sent to me
Ten milk jugs full of pills and like eighty bales of weed
On the fourth day, said, "Fuck that shit," went on a spree
I got niggas still want payback for shit did in '03
It’s vibe, what the fuck you want a fifth and on the sixth
On the seventh day of Christmas, got a new drum for the stick 
Shit funny now
Ain't funny then, yeah
Fuck it
On the eighth day of Christmas, I got into a beef 
Ninth day of Christmas, they beggin' me for peace 
Tenth day of Christmas, they callin' up police 
Niggas try to stop it, but they started it with me
Rentals called the house, they gon' terminate the lease 
Eleventh day of Christmas, put our shit out on the streets 
Twelfth day of Christmas, got my momma losin' sleep
It might be Christmas to you, but just another day to me
I hate Christmas1017 Dreamteam
Eating them percocetes like they was baked beans
I just gotta find out who got clean lean
And gas weed and Miley C
Peewee Longway with me that's my blood brother
Two pints of P's on us so we mud brothers
My life's a gangsta movie man I love colors
I'm in a red Bentley Brookland it's just me and Thugga
They say I'm getting skinny but all of my blunts stuffed
Ain't nuthin' skinny but them skinnies on my bentley truck
This molly really got me thow'd up in a Mulsanne backseat
Pow'd up two three's of the codeine
And feel im bout to OD
I'm in a rari but I'm runnin from the police
A carbon 15 on me and an ounce of OG
These niggas say they know Gu-wop but they don't know me
Ten G's of molly on me so i brought sand to the beach
I'm in a Ghost same color dope
Feel like I just came here on a banana boat
Come to my store, knock on my door
Soon as I get rid of them I got plenty more
Like Curtis Blow I got to blow
Like Bruce Leroy I got to glow
I do a show like I'm selling dope
I rep for the hood it's a dope show
Me and big Gu-wop servin them bricks of du-wop
Them drummers south bricks to d-block
They bookin' those shows for re-rock
Money four door so now I'm re-routin
Looking at a real dope boy with cleeves out
Lebron James shooter trekkin what the heat brought
Real dope boy finnessing with the sheet rock
Feeling like Wayne put it on mamacita
Hit the block break it down serve James Ether
Fuck a thought with drop with the egg beater
Pull up in a drop top with a damn nina
C-Note say we not done counting 20's
Me and Wop in a Bentley flying down 20
Pourin' mud so dark think we sippin' henny
Got a bitch so bad call her dream of Jeannie
Dope show doing shows like I'm sellin' dope
I'm counting 300,000 now while she snorting coke
She mix her coke with heroine then she call it speed ballin'
I mix my cookin' with OG I hear that weed callin'
I'm on the phone slurring my words because the lean talking
Sipping champagne shoppin' for jeans I'm at Neiman Marcus
Trying on Giuseppes with a FN with a beam on it
Smelling like I just smoked a half a pound of green homey
The Trus got me looking lean homey
They say the Robins looking mean homey
But I ain't sticky cut some lean on it
They say I'm picky bout' my weed homey
These niggas trick u with the lean I buy PT's only
These niggas killin' what they eat homey
They'll treat you like a piece of meat homey
So don't get butchered in the street homey

Lambo engine in the rear and I'm switching gears
Y'all suckers can't fuck wit this young nigga here
Diamonds on my neck colder than a case of beer
So when I fall off in the club all the bitches cheer
M6 convertible my top can disappear
Just bought a house in Cali pool parties all through the year
Temp fade stupid waves I don't wear a beard
They say that Gucci stay fresh but that nigga weird
I shop at Fifth Plaza, lil buddy he shop at Sears
Diamonds solitaire so big it damn near broke my ears
Girl you riding wit La Flare so what you got to fear?
2010 no more Rolls-Royces so I'm just coppin Lears
Jazze Pha, Gucci no they didn't expect this
It ain't no secret run up on me you'll regret it
I'm like a ball player focused on my next hit
And I hit homeruns I don't know how to bunt, bitch
And this that Cali kush you need to pass the blunt, bitch
I'm sorry that I cuss you baby girl you're gorgeous
Psych you're not gorgeous but your ass is enormous
And if you never call me I'll be rich regardless
Picture perfect flow this verse here is a portrait
I got three mansions but I'm from Sun Valley apartments
Bouldercrest, Flat Shoals and Gresham is where I started
You wanna find me bitch just keeping riding down MorelandJ. White, I need the beat I can go off on
You changed on me, Mr. Wop
You're not the same Gucci Mane from the block
And you're so mean to the meanest
And your bling is the cleanest
And your chains must be worth a lot
You're not the same to me, Mr. Wop
With all the planes and the rings and the watch
You're the worst and you know it
You got cash and you blow it
And your things must be worth a lot
I don't like Gucci Mane, shawty changed on me
He ain't the same, there's somethin' about him, there's somethin' strange to me
Maybe the money or the clothes or the jewels he rock
He don't just wear the watch, he abuse the wok
So outlandish man, that they can't stand the man
I'm a living urban legend just like Candyman
Nose candy man, I served it hand to hand
Sniper rifle like a soldier in Afghanistan
I let my money and my car do all the talking 
I'm the Grinch, I'll put an artist in a coffin 
Fuck a dog, I'll let my gat do all the barking
Know you a bitch, but you a pussy, you's a softy
You changed on me, Mr. Wop
You're not the same Gucci Mane from the block
And you're so mean to the meanest
And your bling is the cleanest
And your chains must be worth a lot
You're not the same to me, Mr. Wop
With all the planes and the rings and the watch
You're the worst and you know it
You got cash and you blow it
And your things must be worth a lot
When you hit a lick I'll be the fence 
I'll loan you money when you in a pinch 
You gotta pay me back really quick 
Gotta charge ya interest, nigga, I'm the Grinch 
Had a murder charge but they couldn't convict 
If the glove don't fit you must acquit 
Got a Jewish lawyer runnin' my defense
Let me out before the gavel hit the bench
I'm the Grinch that made ya eat that other bitch
Mistletoe on my dick, I made 'em kiss
These broke niggas mad 'cause they on the bench 
I'm on the courtside, ballin' like Swish 
You changed on me, Mr. Wop
You're not the same Gucci Mane from the block 
And you're so mean to the meanest
And your bling is the cleanest
And your chains must be worth a lot 
You're not the same to me, Mr. Wop
With all the planes and the rings and the watch
You're the worst and you know it
You got cash and you blow it
And your things must be worth a lot 
2020, no 20's

Wordplay
A nigga so fly that I should have been a pilot
I know a nigga rap but I could have been a stylist
Feel like a jeweler 'cause I rock so many diamonds 
Could never run for president, my past too violent
Fam so broke that I had to start grindin'
Why I'm lookin' bummy? Everybody else shinin'
Turned into a burglar and did a couple break-ins
Started as a corner boy, then turned into a kingpin
Walkin' in Magic lookin' like I were El Chapo
Hot damn Gucci, that's a cold-blooded Hublot
I can't even fuck with one hoe, I need two
And you ain't gotta call hoe, I don't need you
Jumpin' out a car with no roof in a suit hoe
What type of nigga do the shit that I do hoe?
Started as a group, but I'm so dope I went solo
Get your ass knocked off and call it free promo
Chopper make a nigga back crack like Romo
Gucci go hard on a bitch, no homo
Pull up in an 18-wheeler, me dolo
Feelin' like Sosa was born to move yayo
Life's about taking risks
I told my baby pray for me, I'm tryna be all I can be
Put my pants on just like you, so why you envy me?
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm tryna live out my dreams, if I offend you, pardon me
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm just tryna see all that I can see
Never mind me, I'm tryna be all I can be
Ay, they wanna know, how does it feel to be a star?
How's it feel to ride around the house for your car?
How does it feel to not have to sell that raw?
I'm told 'em I'm way more paranoid 'cause now they hate me more
They say, "Rock, how does it feel to be last of a dying breed?"
You pump life into these streets, they were in dying need
Off that real shit, that softest, that uncut, that raw
That shit that they jam to everyday when they jump up
The law, the word, they meet me in the AM
My voice I bring the gate in, in the evenings, still beatin' me
Hit the club still playing, still playing when they leavin'
It feels good, they believe me
They receive me, I am how they perceive me
I put my soul into these lyrics, listen, you will hear it
Backseat Mulsanne, Drop Top and the Dawn
Where would the streets be without the Trap God and the don?
Life's about taking risks
I told my baby pray for me, I'm tryna be all I can be
Put my pants on just like you, so why you envy me?
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm tryna live out my dreams, if I offend you, pardon me
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm just tryna see all that I can see
Never mind me, I'm tryna be all I can be
Fuck your CEO and tell 'em King Gucci said that
Cause I ain't never ever hit a lick and brought the bread back
That's your CEO? We used to gamble for his contract

Standin' in the trap, catchin' J's in my wavecap
Cappin' 'bout none of these niggas rappin' 'bout a fake trap
Call Ghostbusters 'cause these niggas sellin' ghost crack
Point 'em to the kitchen and the nigga need a roll 
Put me in the kitchen and I might just bring a whole back
Put a hole in a nigga head, tell him "hold that"
This that eggbeater music, get it out the bowl rap
This that wife beater music, sell it while it wet rap
You a dick rider and I never will respect that
Came out, took my set back, I know they didn't expect that
Gucci worth eight figures, but he tryna stretch that
My partner turned informer on me, I never woulda guessed that
Life's about taking risks
I told my baby pray for me, I'm tryna be all I can be
Put my pants on just like you, so why you envy me?
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm tryna live out my dreams, if I offend you, pardon me

If I fuck with ya, I'm making you straight drop
If I don't know ya, I'ma give ya rerock
Got a bando in Boston

Thought about a charm cause I felt like splurging
Showed my jeweler love then he made the chain perfect
Man, I'm one take perfect, VVS diamond chains, don't they look pretty

It's Gucci, Shawty Red nigga
Let's go
A bitch I can't catch is something I've never seen 
A bitch I can't catch I will never see 
She come around me, she won't wanna leave 
Her game so good, have her onto me
You niggas spilled the drops but drops I never see
My dope so clean, make your nose bleed
The feel so strong, make you breach a tear
The smoke so strong, higher down the tree
I'm a Success story, take a look at my journey
In a trap house full of niggas, tryna get them some money
Remix, fix fake bails, pills and dummies
RIP my uncle Sunny and my homeboy Lonny
I trick so many people, should go church on Sunday
But I would be a hypocrite because the work come Monday
I grew up so fucked up, that's I'm oh so cunning
And I can honestly tell you niggas that I'm so dishonest
Let's give a shout out to the ducks, in the world I punish
You think Gucci give a fuck, you got one thing coming
If you's a buster, me and you have nothing in common
Trap house, stash house, all I rap bout money
It's Gucci
A bitch I can't catch is something I've never seen 
A bitch I can't catch I will never see 
She come around me, she won't wanna leave 
Her game so good, have her onto me
You niggas spilled the drops but drops I never see
My dope so clean, make your nose bleed
The pill so strong, make you grit your teeth
The smoke so strong, higher than the tree
Futuristic wrist watch if you rollie tic toc
Then it's not a rollie, hold your rollie it to the tip top
Six shot, big shot, top down but tits out
Rolls Royce, drop top, call Alfred Hitchcock
I miss Big, I miss Pac
She walked out, she bitched out
She suck the dick non-stop
I think I hit the jackpot
She act out, she ashed out
We ranned out, you're handout
Rappers say they stand out
But yet they got they hand out
If trap music ain't hip-hop
Then Gucci Mane ain't hip-hop
Humble county grow houses then we have a great crop
Hard in the paint trap but nigga I can blake out
They shorted me 300, But I served his ass a shake ounce
A bitch I can't catch is something I've never seen 
A bitch I can't catch I will never see 
She come around me, she won't wanna leave 
Her game so good, have her onto me
You niggas spilled the drops but drops I never see
My dope so clean, make your nose bleed
The feel so strong, make you breach a tear
The smoke so strong, higher down the treeZaytoven on the track
Zay-tiggy! Gucci, Gucci
So Icy Entertainment
Let's go
They call me Chef Boy RG, but hold that thought
It's a Kodak moment, how I hold that fork
Got a hurricane wrist game tornado turns dog
Pockets Piggly Wiggly, caine Kermit the Frog dawg
Early in the mornin, I ain't even yawnin
Cookin up a cake, like I'm doin a performance
When it come to flossin, I ain't even talkin
Diamonds on my donk* got my Chevy moonwalkin
Ten bricks on my Bart Simpson, just look
My watch, thirty-five pounds of kush
My ring, thirty-six O's my nig'
My bracelet, five hundred pounds of mid'
A Gucci wrapped tour bus, y'all hoes follow us
Party pack of pills man, hoes gonna swallow us
Naturally a loner, but love my kid
Mix the soda with the cola, I can buy me a friend
New swag somethin like Trap House times 10
E'ry nig' around me bust heads, YA DIG?~!
Iced out grill, I can't buy that bullshit
I'm with some street shit, like the reverend in the pulpit
Like the boy Rip Ham I got a real good J
One gram for the eighty, that's a real good play
Got them Vince Carter quarters, add soda and water
I'm not athletic, but I'mma straight baller
The Spud Webb ticket, with the Larry Bird yay
And it's jumpin from the free throw like MJ
See my 'Vette pass by, like a Steve Nash pass
Stay loyal like the fans of the Utah Jazz
Like Dr. J shorts, my work real tight
You got that Atlanta Hawks yay, it won't get right
 Catch me on the rebound, like Bo Outlaw
I'mma Mikey Vick it, whip it, cook it southpaw
Thirty-six ho-zoes, tried to make the endzone
Make a Joe Horn move, and use my cell phone
Always scramblin in the pot, just like Steve Young
Five for the Keyshawn, seven for the Deion
Gucci on fire like mojo crack pot
Fell over a chump, right back like crack rock
Money stupid dumb, just like Cold Blood
Just like Young Hot, I show no love
Mines is gettin like Cheeba, mines like Fat
And my trap roll hard, just like Shawty Black
I'mma country ass nigga, just like Ace
Gotta fetish, for the stones, just like UGK
My dough like bruh, yours like G
And my patience very short, just like Courtney C
Angie B, Russell P, but it's yo' choice
My girl Angel pussy deep, like Slick Man voice
Like Redd oh-three, man I got bread
My pocket on swoll like HP fo'head
I'mma money go getter, so I'm like gettin {?}
Gotta a hundred hoes jockin, just like throwback
Ay man, Street Entertainment
So Icy Entertainment
We present the Trap-A-Thon
That's a money makin marathon
Cause Gucci Mane I'm a trapaholic
I'm addicted to the trap, you feel me?
I'm in Zone 6 central right now
Chillin in the traphouse

I feel like a motherfuckin waffle house chef right now
GEAH! Gucci Mane, Laflare man
So Icy Entertainment, goneI'm so motherfuckin' turned up right now
Someone please turn Gucci Mane down
Brick Squad thugged out, we don't give a fuck
We hit the club, shoot the club, tear the club up
So you should hit the floor. Get low and shut up
Hit the floor, get low and shut the fuck up
You's a bitch, you's a snitch, you a motherfuckin' scrub
I pulled up in a 4-door Porsche, set-trippin'
3 young dreadhead niggas riding with me
I don't think they like me and I don't like em neither
But if they move wrong, I'll red up their white beater
I do it for the hood, I do it like no equal
I do it for the red, black, yellow, white people
I just bought a K, just the other day
And I don't play with grown men: I don't like to play
I'm so motherfuckin' turned up right now
Niggas hang on me, I don't give a fuck right now
Well you niggas keep on trying like the little engine that could
You think you can, you think you could, I think you pussies should
Call me Gucci Flocka Flame, I dun changed my name
Call me Frenchie Mane La Flare, Gucc' the Kid..it's all the same
I be running, gunning, stunting with 100 killers riding
You snitching, bitching, tattle-telling, scared to stand beside me
I just bought another house just to house my goons
So Icey Entertainment, boy, we just like a platoon
The colors in my chain remind me of a cartoon
I'll murk your boy in March, they didn't find that boy til June
I wish they found him August so that's like "too much too soon"
His face was swoll and puffy, bout the color of a prune
Brick Squad Movement and, no, you're not apart of it
Me, Waka and Wu, Juice and Frenchie Mane started it
Iced out bar got me ballin' like the Lakers
Homicide around the corner. Where you, in Jamaica?
My volume on max, you boys better run
I'm a Nigga With an Attitude holding on the gun
17 niggas, I left 16 hit
Last nigga hit the corner, got his whole head split
Told you you're a goner, I'mma leave you dead quick
I'm like Wu the Kid, thugged out, we don't give a fuck
Let your soul meet the sole of the bottom of my Chucks
Black car, black tint with the baby tags
Stay low to the floor, my midget out the bagYou niggas know how much I made on i-20
Your baby daddy broke, I bury him in all twenties
I had mad when I was up going like nine cubits
You know Gucci had that shit for six fifty
In 1995, I ain’t have a pretty penny
2005 man, I had that nigga ugly milli
The most hated in the game
Nigga ask 50
I went broke
I ain’t never had 160
Sometimes I do a show they say they wanna shop with me
So when I think about it I wish I had a truck with me
I might just call a nigga bluff
And see if he fuck with me
My star status niggas can’t get enough muggie
My own status can’t touch me
No you can’t touch me
Got a hundred nigga rush
Hundred nigga rush
Not a rush with them all with me
Rush them all with me
Dare a nigga fucking touch me
Dare a nigga touch me
Got a hundred Russian nigga
And they say the wanna rush up
Drinking Vodka with a Russian bitch
You know I wanna fuck
Tell her never say a dope again
Never say a dope again
Whippin dope
I’m whippin dope  and not a junkers rushing in
Hit around the city with a hundred in my pope bag
Dropping half a pound a cash
With the bitch cause she too bad
Rush into the room
Getting head
And the drop head
She ate the little left
And told me it can win a price tag
Rich, I ain’t wealthy
Just a nigga with a big bag
If you ain’t work for million dollars
I don’t want to chit chat
Your baby momma eat a nigga dead
Like a kit cat
Kicking up a never bitch
Never get to chill back
You kill that nigga for me
I will make you a rich man
Kick spice on my kicks
Like I can;t find a falcon
Before I got in the game
I was selling cherry girl
Put her into texting
Put her number in the trash canIt’s the East Atlanta summer so y'all don’t trip
I can wrap a brick up like a Christmas gift
Me and that white girl got a relationship
I got 50 mil zanny, you can take this piff

She don't want to be bothered
You callin' like a father
You actin' like a toddler

Amigo friends might recommend the whole enchilada
Your girlfriend is a quitter
You should spit or you saliva
I'm Gucci Mane the mobster
Not a jocker, not a blogger
Gucci let's get 'em
Got that AR chopper
Come through the front door
Left them at the doctor
Now we up a hundred more bands, that's proper
No need for a preacher
Pray to me, I'll be your father
Hide the young ones cause I'm coming for your daughter
If you ain't selling pussy, I ain't gon' bother
Got a pornstar, a ho, and a model
In the club we do big shit
Pop a hundred bottles
We gettin' hoes wet
They gon' need goggles
They said get that gas
So I'm on that full throttle
If I had a dick, than I'd tell that bitch to swallow
Thirty in my clip and I'm letting out hallows

Shit gets real]
Now that I'm finally free
I'm bouta throw it today
I take my life in my hands
Cause I'm a grown-ass man
Now that I'm finally free
I was lost, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now I see
Super high, can't touch the ground
Life tested me, but God blessin' me
Every 16 bars is a testimony
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa
Had to find myself, then remind myself
Fuck up, I'm grown, I got to blame myself
Streets taught me everything, I trained myself
Dead wrong so long, didn't know nothin' else
They wanna lock my crew up like ???
Think every man ??? and amuse himself
Glad as well, but I'm mad as hell
Because my best friend probably gon' die in jail
Ain't no lie to tell, probably cry like hell
If I dwell on it, cause he got 80 years
I'm going hard, you see I might as well
Cause I got a hard head like my daddy had
And my daddy's dead
I bet my great great great great grandpa had a real crazy swag
So I stand today, then get down to pray
The second is now and my mind is made
I got a point to prove, and a son to raise
Can't let him make mistakes that his daddy made
Squash the beef I'm free of that
This crazy song, they ain't feelin' that
I guess they wanna see us kill each other
If I'm dead, who the fuck gonna help my mother
I done struggled and hustled too hard for this
I done rob stealed killed, ain't proud of that
Smoke weed, took pills and sold powder packs
I'm a soldier but you stand, where the cowards at?
Man your homeboy gone where the flowers at
All the money in the world can't bring that back
If I had one wish, wish mom and dad could
Come down now and see me rap
But she see me now, and I believe in that
On the strength of that I ain't goin' back
So I put my whole family on my back
Lost so much time, can't pay that back
I was lost, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now I see
Super high, can't touch the ground
Life tested me, but God blessin' me
Every 16 bars is a testimony
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa
Had to find myself, then remind myself
Fuck up, I'm grown, I got to blame myself
It's Gucci
 x2
I was lost, but now I'm found
Don't you ?? then keep me down
See my life go round and round
I say I straightened up my act
And I ain't never goin' back
Now that I' m finally free 
You'll never take me away 
Took everything that I have 
???????????
Now that I'm finally free 
I'm bouta throw it today

My front yard still look like a car show
Mansion so big, kids playing Where's Waldo
Where's Waldo, Gucci where's Waldo?
I jumped out my Vette, to jump in my Gallardo
That new Gallardo? That stanky new Gallardo?
That baby blue Gallardo, cuz I'm so far from Harpo
Harpo beat me, baby girl beast me
Pulled up, hit the horn twice like beep beep
She remind me of a ????
These jeans ain't cheap, and the kicks aren't either
Either way, I'm a ride illegal
I'm higher than an eagle on ether
I'm higher than a falcon on California reefer
Got money like a Falcon, no Dan Reeva
Humongous bracelet, rings like I'm Jordan
I'm not 23, but not far from it
She flyer than an airplane
On my private jet mane
I'm not talking air train
Flyer than a ??

A young snotty nose sleeping on my granddaddy floor
Is this a crack house, 'cause junkies keep walking through the door
Plus my stomach having chest problems for going to steal out the store
And if my school lunch wasn't free I wouldn't have nothing to eat
So many cousins at my house, I didn't have nowhere to sleep
Didn't notice I was poor till I walked down the street
Rather have holes in my shoes than have no shoes on my feet
My family tree filled of alcoholics, nigga, gangstas and theives
Had to learn how to fight before you learn how to read
Wish my grandma was still living, miss my sister Charlese
'Cause she the only one I know kept it realer than me

Throw back Percocets and pour up Wock', we call that powered up 
Put four holes up in that big boy's back, call him an Audi truck
Get shot up in your face for cursin', nigga, better not shout at us
Better know you chasin' death, talkin' 'bout you comin' after us
They say, "30, you done lost it, poured up in the water bottle" 
Strapped up with a Judge on me, I got the biggest revolver 
Heard my new opp was a problem, popped out with that problem-solver

After school snack syrup and fo' pieces of bread
Granddaddy why yo' eyes so God damn red?
"Got a real soft ass and a hard-ass head
Better mind your fuckin manners boy," that's what he said
I moved to East Atlanta at the age of 9

Family callin' for him, lookin', think they need to let go
Hope they got insurance for him, probably need gecko
Drop my nuts, don't push my test
Throw your foot on they neck, protect your threshold

I'll get 'em knocked off, sit back, use my dental floss

Why you wanna put me on standby?
I can't lie, girl you're hotter than a campfire
We can stay up all night like vampires
Complement each other like burgers and french fries
In the last minute I done thought about you ten times
Fine on the out but she pretty on the inside
And every since she left it's like my heart died
Baby I think you can bring out Gucci's other side
She said, "How you don't you trust me, you did a homicide?"
Then said, "I got a boyfriend who I can't put aside
Even though the grass so much greener on the other side."
And every man like what he can't have
It's funny but I came back
Baby girl so bad, diss me but I ain't mad
Why you wanna tease me?
You should wanna squeeze me
Homie ain't the kid, baby he could never be me
How you wanna go and act anti-social
Bet your man don't know you like I know you, so true
Maybe one day babe you gon get your mind right
And if you looking for me you can find me in Atlanta
Once upon a time a long time ago
I had a bitch but she felt she had to let me go
Called me and then she came by and said, "Shit
Yeah you got talent but I'm a bad bitch."
But now when I see her shorty whole swag switched
I walk right by her like she don't exist
Her car broke down and it can't get fixed
Her swag broke down and her bag counterfeit
That's not Gucci, baby that's floochy
Remember 2000 you was acting all booshie
9 years later and you're best friend choosing
I scooped her in my phantom and I took her to the movies
Gucci don't gotta act anti
Told her she can have me when she want,that's when she fantasized
Told her I can't talk to her cause I got that man pride
Ever since I left baby girl told me her heart died 
Excuse me if I sound a little crazy
But just wanna be good to my baby
Cause he been holding me down
And putting it down
He give me everything I don't need no one around
But you're saying you can give it to me better
Get me hot like it's July and I'm rocking a sweater
Just for hitting the road
Would you women let go
Say you got 20/20
Her man's 2004
Maybe I'll give you a try
And keep it low
I could let you ride
Something like a test drive
See baby I ain't so antiWhat's he thinkin'? I mean that nigga buggin'
And got the nerve to be covin
And knowing you ain't in his budget
I give you cars so you can dust 'em
I give you furs so you can fluff 'em
And when you learn you ain't touchin'
Get what you want girl know I ain't fussin'
You can have it all
Oooh ooh oooh ooh
You can have it all
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I say put amazing karats on it, it is no comparison
I come home every night
And take you out to eat on Saturdays
Your ex boyfriend was not a baller he was get n by barely
Hilarious
Apparently lil homie like some parody
I put amazing karats on you
You should see the clarity
We'll copartner a daughter
In the future she'll inherit it
I cannot stop starin' at you
I mean that's a draw
See to get by you in church and we'll donate things to charity
Acknowledge me and I could help you study with geography
Psychology
Finance n economics and my biology
No stoppin' me
Let's shake that ....,
Let's buy some property
It's lonely at the top
So why don't you come and get on top of me
It's Gucci
What's he thinkin'? I mean that nigga buggin'
And got the nerve to be covin
And knowing you ain't in his budget
I give you cars so you can dust 'em
I give you furs so you can fluff 'em
And when you learn you ain't touchin'
I'll give you anything to keep you blushin'
You can have it all

All my bricks are flippable, so extra grams are tippable

I'm whippin dope excessively, I pick my trap selectively
He peekin' in the kitchen, so I feel he disrespectin' me
I'm pushin' man, but sellin' dope has always been my legacy
Seven apartments, double my garment, all the junkies beggin' me
Pills and pints and ecstasy, I need a secretarity
Damn, I said it wrong, but fuck it, I'm a celebrity
I'm re-rockin' squares, a hundred thousand profit regularly
So let me get this straight, I'm tryna hear this shit you tellin' me
You can't price this dope I'm sellin' unless you dumb niggas that's mailin' me

If being filthy rich is a crime
I guess I'm guilty bitch

These suckas talking nonsense

Cause I don't have a conscience
I'm strapped like Bronson
Brick Squad, Trap House, beat bunking
I'm wild like Tarzan
I'm swinging through the Zone 6
In Ferraris. It's on again
I go to win, strap-for-strap
I go rap for rap, I rep the trap
Refuse the death but game to slap
My phone is tapped
I'm off the wall and off the scale
Came out of jail like
A bat out of hell
I refuse to pay up, gotta salute the myth
Got Clientele, I might as well
I'm moving weight from state-to-state
I gots to get my aconchelet
I know the feds be watching me
But there ain't no way they stopping me
Drop a pack off to my lawyer
Take these charges, overturn em
Roll the kush in my trial papers
And burn em - I'm not going
The fork in it and my Glock showing
If it don't shine then it's not glowing
Ain't mine if it's not foreign

One day timothy broke in a truck, quarter million bucks
What the fuck, crazy luck, now he think he rich as fuck
They hit the mall bought it all jordans, bellies, pellet jackies
Six slugs in his grill, all the hoes throwing pussy at him
Little did he know that that dough came from Black & Joe
Joe from down on Coasta Ave and all he did was slang the snow
So Joe sent Black with scraps and goons to catch him at his momma home
Rang the bell, then 'ventually put two shots in his momma dome

And he catches Black straight in his back he on his knees
Joe was bussin' like a fuckin Russian he barely escaped
But his right hand man is bleeding to death in his face
Tim's gone, he back at the spot, holding on his scrap
And he know that ain't nothing he can do to bring her back
Now big Joe don't give a fuck no more, he can't even love no more
He took 40 g's up out his stack, and set kill tim and his crew
Now Timothy is laying low, that quarter mill's not here no more
His momma she not here no more, and Black will never breath fo sho'

He can't run away from this, he don't got no where to go
Plus the police looking for em' they was watching Black and Joe

Snowflakes out here finna go

Put so much hand on your head, it’ll make your neck hurt
And when it come to moving packs, man I’m a expert

A knucklehead little boy, my grandma say I need church

And my bank account pregnant from my right hand
And my crew get wasted like a Rock glass

Still get paid on the first and the third
Splurge with an urge, goons on the go
Waiting on Gucci Mane just to give them the word
First 48, I killt  the parking lot
Big blunts of kush I spark a lot
Offset forgs, they sticking out
Park that bitch in the 6 a lot
Hundreds in my pocket, they falling out

Wish my gran' could see me now
Big Kid say he want to be me now
Tell the truth, I wanna be me too
Want a fly on the wall with a bird's eye view
My whole life should've been pay-per-view
Rock solid, make good profit
But I wish I had like ten pockets
Thugged out, then plugged in
I think I got like ten socketsI did a show in Macon, said that I couldn't go in there
Pulled up with ten Memphis killas with pistols everywhere
Probation violation shit, must had to stay in there
But if they knew about my life I'd get electric chair

Tell her the truth you got shot in the tooth
No sippin', no drippin' like I wanted to poop
What did you do? What did you do?
Why on the sudden I'm one of the 2?
Half over million I feed on my belly
You run up while you got shot in the kidney
They shot you ,nigga
They shot you in the headPicture me
Put a frame on me, nigga
Cookin' plenty deep
I got them bails, and don't call unless you want more than three

Ain't scared of shit, nigga, you can buy this shit from me
Have you seen pics of me recently?

Ain't scared of shit, nigga, you can buy this shit from me
Sayin' somethin', I'mma lay someone

But I'mma ride around with my drum
You can send some, but I'mma send some
But the ones I'mma send gon' hit somethin'
If you hit one,  you might get some
If you don't hit none, you don't get shit
Picture me as a Watcher, nigga

Oh Lord shes the preacher's daughter

Come blow the candles out baby
Ok, ok, ok, Animal ok, ok, Glamorous ok, ok
She's the preacher's daughter, but I'm a ghetto star, ok
She ain't going nowhere because I just beat her raw, ok
Hooked her on the first shot, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, ok
I let her play Khloe, I just play Lamar, ok
She just hit my cell  cause she done left her bra, ok
I, I, I got her on quavo
Got her with her shorts off, looking at her vajayo
Driving with my fingers crossed hoping I don't go to hell
I, I, I got her rolling
I, I got her losing focus
She like a devil with her red dress
I wanna get her in my incents
And plus I was just too fresh
She was flirting getting too fresh
She the preacher daughter on the alter
But, I spoil her like her father
I school her like a toddler
She with Gucci, so don't bother
I go harder and grind harder
I ride hard as she loving my persona
The aroma, a Kush ammonia
It's what she smells and I can't keep my hands off her 
Red plus she bowlegged her cherry no pit, yea
Caught on the six yep for later on the six, yea
One thing I can say about her, shawty takes the stick, yea
She was greener then a motherfucker now I got her talking slick
She get it from her momma, all in the hips
I love walking behind her, so I can see her twist
I think I hit her kidneys the last time I ripped
I felt kind of bad though, so I left her a tip
Her Becky on steroids, that's little momma gift
She don't like to drink it strong though, so I just let her sip
4 o'clock in the morning, that liquor had me stiff
But that's my little baby she know how to make a gripUh

Blowing Mary Jane

Riding round in a Rari, jumped off in a vet
Man the rap game hurting, heard that its a joke
Pull up in the U-Haul with 2 thousand pints
Pouring up the lean yeah I'm pouring up the act

I suggest you invest in a nigga with some clout
I suggest that you put a rich nigga off in yo mouth
You know I’m ice cold
Ice cold 
I’m so cold when it comes to hoes
Think my heart is made of coal
If you ask my mama though, she’ll say my heart is made of gold
But my Rollie made of gold and my heart been turned to stone
And my boss a rolling stone and where he lay his head home
Baby girl I’m freezing, take me out the freezer
If you don’t believe me I can make you a believer
My motor had a heart attack, my truck, it had a seizure
All this gold around my neck, they think I come from Egypt
Gucci Mane got stupid grown so you can fire that weed up
Go on and call yo hairdresser cause I’ma fuck yo weave up
Diamond rings all on my fingers, I look like a preacher
Losers keepers, you can keep her, I just wanna freak her
Coldhearted, I got mo' money than a gold artist
They say rapping make you money, I keep buying mo' 'raris
Strangers talk when they walk by me then they say sorry
And if a nigga touch me, shut down the whole damn party
Drinking Rosé out the bottle, like a ice cold vodka
They say you bought her the D but you just start balling
I used to run up on the scene but I got no degree, shawty
Niggas don’t gotta fuck with me long as these bitches keep calling
I’m a stone cold killer, load my shot Glock 40
You got a problem 'fore you walk, don’t be no dead man walking
Tried to be a humble nigga but my bread started talking
Tried to tell my dogs to stop but them choppas start barking
I say what the fuck I wanna say like my nigga Charles Barkley
How you gon' play ball with niggas when you niggas not balling?
Tried to sneak me in the joint, had to stomp 'em to the floor
I ain’t goin' back no more cause it’s so ice cold in the holeAlbum Art:

She wants to sleep with me - Gucci needs two or three
I keep you icy  I have you super fresh 
I know you like me; you like the way I dress
Baby in love with me, I'm in like with her
Gave me some head, I spent one night with her
Keep a college girl past her curfew
Say she like me and she like her too
Get a bitch, suck a dick, what she gon' do?

Tell your girlfriend and your best friend too
You can bring the whole dorm, they can have some fun too

Kinda heard she was thorough but the shit ain't true
I give the bitch the world but she don't know what to do
Parasuco outfits, icy fresh hairdos

1470, on top of Sun Valley
Where a young nigga jumped off and started trapping

Fucking with them double crossing bitches from the valley
Mountain Park apartments, everybody capping
Don't go to Triangle 'cause you might just get your ass kicked
Bottom of the hill shooting hoops, Sun Valley

Zay
Legends
Zaytoven 
Killers at the hospital to finish the job 
Just the simple fact you still alive, it must your God 
Here's a lil' story 'bout this dude I knew named Todd 
Lil' trappin'-ass nigga that I met Mount Park 
I saw the devil and didn't even have no pitchfork 
If you scared, go to church and please don't jump off the porch 
I ain't box in the MMA but it's a blood thirsty sport
In the street we hold court until we end up in court 
A crash dummy on the crash course, no chance to abort 
Even when I didn't have money I couldn't afford to be scared 
I went to school with serial killers, if I lie, take my breath
I grew up with lil' Todd, he got hits on his belt 
Well-known for murkin', sold the plug some hoes 
Rolled the red carpet out when he hit the door 
He a legend, known for pressin', think his presence a blessin'
Yes, he allegedly kidnapped a couple eses from Texas 
Nigga reckless, been in the cell, ain't the one to be tested 
My suggestion if you see him, better head for the exit
Yeah he'll eat a nigga breakfast then he'll come back for seconds
He get it how he live, how he live, he get it 
Soft white devil, watch me turn it to hard 
Guwoped up coke tore the family apart 
This not a blackboard, but it look like chalk 
Trap God, I make miracles with my grey fork 
East Atlanta, Georgia this is not New York 
Certain situations make the rabbi eat pork 
Lil' Todd told a yapper, they say it's my fault 
All I do is brag and floss what the dope man bought 
Lil' Todd at your house with a gun to your spouse
Hogtied on the couch, duct tape, can't talk 
Two weeks later heard he got his head blowed off
End of game, ruined another tryna play 8-ball
Fuck the messenger who told me, his gossipin' ass 
I got garbage bag money, I throw my roof in the trash 
I got bipolar money, I got crazy cash 
Had them delusions of grandeur about my crazy past, it's Wop

From the blunt guts, smokers on the porch
With the bong full of bud And the kegs pumped up
Yeah that’s right, cocaine got these boys scratching they head like a head of lice
Bad luck on the floor with a bitch when I thought I had a hit, but instead it was a dike
So I gave her just what Gucci mane tried to get you to take
Soon as it set in, she came in with a twin and let off the breaks
I got this party started, ready for the mike like a starving artist

Half of these niggas don't like me 
Got me grabbing for my gun, got me going on the run
Got blood all on my Nikes 
A lot of the hoes be striking 
Some of these hoes be trifling 
Got a nigga in the trunk jumping out with the pump
And you came to the hotel icey 
Bring a dog to the fight, bet the dog gon' bite
I'll end a nigga life with a gun or a knife 
I'll take a nigga girl, I'll fuck a nigga wife
If you do it in the dark, then it's coming to light 
Got the plug pulling up to the park with the white 
On the Crest with a vest and a tech and a check
Don't do it the best, but I'll do it to the death
Don't need you to do it, I'll do it myself
I called my chick and said "I need some more of that" 
The way she put it on me, at a loss for words 
I called my plug and said "I need some more of that" 
A thousand pounds of herb and plus a lot of purp
I'm sipping lean, I'm 'bout to pour some more of that 
I think I need about a thousand pints of syrup 
You make me mad, then I'ma fuck your ho for that 
I got your bitch with me, I know your feelings hurt
Your bitch is with me and your bitch is a flirt 
Limpin' with pimpin' I know that it hurt
Took off her dress and I took her to dinner
Then took off my shirt and she took off her skirt
Smoking on purp and I ball out the vert
Hating on Gucci is making it worse 
Your dick in the dirt and my goons on alert
And I wonder if this nigga can fill up a church 
All of my niggas still fuck with the work
Fucking with Gucci's a gift and a curse 
Fell on her dress then I fell on her breast
If I'm feeling like that, then I fill up her purse 
Play with me, nigga, you ride in a hearse
Pay me and pull up, these choppers will burst
Hit in the head and I know that it hurt
Dead on arrival no need of a nurse 
You think that it's funny, you owe me some money
You niggas gon' pay me my cash by the first
Fuck with my cheese and these 40s'll burst
Got a hole for you niggas real deep in the earth
I'm fucking your bitch, but she sucking me first 
Roll me a blunt and I pour me some purp
Gucci the boss and your life has a cost
Play with my money, I blow up your house
I called my chick and said "I need some more of that" 
The way she put it on me, at a loss for words 
I called my plug and said "I need some more of that" 
A thousand pounds of herb and plus a lot of purp
I'm sipping lean, I'm 'bout to pour some more of that 
I think I need about a thousand pints of syrup 
You make me mad, then I'ma fuck your ho for that

Well shoot the house apart
Shit, burn it down and call it justice
So holla at the bustas if you looking for a sucker
They  and the body 
Gucci!
Cocaine white as dairy
Provided by Dirty Harry
I bet you call me dirty when I spun this for the Marys
The pounds got me married to my negro for the cabbage
I'm living lavish, gambling houses look like Caesar's Palace
Gucci!
Driving to the hole, I'll pull up on your for the J
I'm dirty when I play, I might cross over for a Tre
Gucci going postal, coast to coast about my mail
I break you playing CeeLo, then I buy your drawers- Chapelle
I'm higher than Stone Mountain and my penguin like a fountain
My boy down in the park will leave your heart somewhere, not pounding
Gucci gamble!
I keep a pocket full of hundreds like I'm finna gamble
Three hundred-fifty in my duffel, finna buy a Lambo
Your life in fucking shambles
You'll try me? That's a gamble
An AR-15 in case a nigga want to gamble
I keep a pocket full of hundreds like I'm finna gamble
Three hundred-fifty in my duffel, 'bout to cop a Lambo
Your life ain't worth the shambles
You'll try me? That's a gamble
AR-15 in case a nigga want to gamble
Nigga try fluids!
My chickens rap Jewish
All white beads and the light shine blue-ish
Money, money money. I'm making love to it
A thousands pounds of mid. You know I'm gonna move it
Snowing in the summer. Raining in the club
Fuck, I'm off to get your diamonds, I just spent a fucking load
Drop a grand in six seconds. Tell a bitch to bounce
She'll find out there I bought a ward that's thicker than a house
My closet like the Gucci store
I am such a Gucci whore
Gucci glasses, Gucci bag, I gotta go and get some more
I'm gonna roll the dice and hope that I don't crap out
Can't through my hand in, I'm too low down
We can reconvene at a place that's more serene
In Athens I'm a God. In Alabama I'm the king
In Georgia I'm the boss. In Las Vegas I'm a baller
And he's a ballerina, dodging bullets like a dodger
Shout out to the bloggers. I know I'm a problem
I'm strapped like Super Contra, so tell the fucking robbers
I'm inky tatted-crazy, diamonds blinking out my pinkie
I'm inky in the water, guess that's why the hoes' so kinky
You rinky, dinky, stinky record labels are beneath me
Now you being nasty. Dissing when you cannot beat me
I'm still undefeated, and that's an honest statement
But I speak it and I preach it, so fuck all of you leechesMy idea is to take my career to the next level. I am planning to take my music to a higher level and use the attention and influence to sell movies, books, clothing and be a living testimony to all people showing that you can start from humble beginnings and transcend to something greater
It feels great to see my plan take root and begin to blossom even though I’m physically incarcerated but spiritually and mentally I’m free as ever. I enjoy working out molding my body and I look forward to changing my diet for the better because I realize to get to the status I crave I must make a life-change which is permanent not a quick-fix
I can see myself now at the top of my game, me and my beautiful lady walking the red carpet at the best parties and getting flooded with accolades at the award shows and setting trends that will be copied around the world. This is not a dream though this is a plan that I will affect directly. I know that by me stayin sober, praying and fasting and stepping up to the plate to the father, and man I am destined to be I will impact my family and the entire universe for the betterEveryday is precious
Make everyday count
Its Wop
Like my nigga Scooter say
Count up! Turn up!
Stand up
Its East Atlantas finest nigga
Its Guwop, turn up
Lets go!

Long back is what be turnin, money I'm gon' be earnin 
 and someone finally return it
You niggas wanna beat me like my cheer and appearance 
You come up to my paper route, then pass interference
Now cash interference, I shine just like my earrings 
It's fifty K today, twelve bars, I'll feed ya appearance
My stick up, it cost more than what you make in a year, man
Don't near man, theres no one near man, you're like a cheer man

Don't try me like I'm a pussy another tin man
I reckon I bust boots so you can call it all

And what that means is I'm takin' all credentials

I'm like the airport, all identification will be checked
Drama!
Look, uh, feelin sorry for the runner up
I'm still away gettin money when the sun is up
And they keep sayin how they need me to deliver
Cause they hate it when the rookie starters can't put the numbers up
Maann, haters so pasé, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day, nigga
And it's just me and my money, ya'll don't even get to play when ya'll are leading by twenty
Yeah, I infiltrated the game, I was hesitant at first and feared what it would change
Now I'm high of the success and faded off of the fame
But still I managed to keep all of my opinions the same
Man, I am So Far Gone, bitch I'm outta here
Hotter than santa inside rockin nauta wear
I want it all man, I never learned how to share
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires
Wow, I swear I'm killin shit, I'm killin shit
Shoutout to the niggas I just made a couple million with
Yeah, from the beginning to the end

You niggas keep gettin cramps in the race, don't pass out, baby!
Look for me in the rafters!
Mike bigger baby, it's bigger baby, Gucci, Louis, Prada
Don Dada, I am hot as the Sahara
What I spit in my saliva is a flow hotter than lava
When I grab a microphone, I flame on like Waka Flocka
Got a thirty-eight revolver that I call my problem-solver
I ain't worried bout no rappers, they just talk, they just holler
When that fire hit their ass, they don't walk, they 
Like a pimp, I pop my collar, act a prospect of tomorrow
Naw said life a bitch, so I'm a break her for some dollars
I will never be a sipper, sorry suckers stuck to 
I will murder ever verse I ever versed to get the guala
I am cursed since I first dispersed a dime bag of guaca in exchange for a dollar
Ay, to all you other rappers out there
If I'm not eatin with ya, and you have an opinion about me
Always remember how insignificant your opinion is to the world
Whether you like, or dislike me, tomorrow's coming
So with that said, get on your grind, because it's about time, bitch!Yeah I fell off for a minute but I’m right back balling
I’m a big ass nigga but got this little sharp on it
I got my wine with me nigga but I ain’t from New Orleans
You know them young niggas will kill you for them brand new Jordans
I fucked the gamblers house up, I want to buy one, bought it
Little bad bitch went and bought me that brand new Audi
They call me thigh pad shawty, got the real high prices
Keep a pocket rocket, make your ass come out of the closet
I got the squares in, niggas smelling like nail polish
My stack seven feet tall like Rasheed Wallace
These niggas say that they some killers but they act like hoes
I got a heart so I'm kill you and send your grandma roses
You better play with your children, you better play with your children
Cause you ain’t got to tell me, I can see you’re in your feelings

Not off no rap check but trapping in them buildings
From all this lean I sip I done spent about a million
And I don’t beef with kids nigga, go play with your children
Working with the work man, just like a gym do
Niggas try to rob me, thank god I had my pistol
Some guy calling me, he talking bout how rent due

Me and my niggas we like brothers, talkin bout hustle down for each otha
We ain’t tussle touch or tongue wrestle wit a nigga, we gone buss em off da muhfuckin muscle
You see can't catch meeee, gucci mane ain’t runnin and i heard dey got pounds of weed

Got a team of cut throat niggas bout kickin doors clean off, when dey get dat word from me
Nigga please and my clique see 1 brick a piece den you gone get burnt to da third degree
Gotta two-twenty-three shootin bullets on da dot, a nigga finna get found by da birds and trees
Get ya ass dropped down on, by a nigga wit grill sayin get down on yo hands and knees
Give a fuck what anotha nigga got, who he shot, just long as da nigga don’t fuck wit me
Ain’t neva been a nigga trickin bucks just to fuck, cuz a slut catch a real nigga nut for free
Catch me on da streets of da southeast, gold grill and a million dolla mouthpiece
Deres a lot of hatin shit said about me, cuz I’m ridin twenty threes on a grand prix
Bitch check my family tree, ain’t nun but G’s, ain’t no pussy nigga finna handle me
You can try and see, I bet you D-I-E, cuz love bussin shots out randomly
Have you lookin at da eyes of a dead body, grab a choppa come back shoot errbody
Give a fuck what ya homeboi say about it, ain’t a muhfuckin secret I’m dead rowdy
I remember when I first start trappin, talkin sun valley tryna make shit happen
Sellin reefa dude, tryna make a lil loot, you can ask D and coop cuz dey seen me in action
Me and my niggas we like brothers, talkin bout hustle down for each otha
We ain’t tussle touch or tongue wrestle wit a nigga, we gone buss em off da muhfuckin muscle
First we lost smiley den we lost dre, den we lost twon den we lost ayon
Now my boy von doin time for a murder charge, shit lookin bad so I gotta pray for em
Where we come from niggas die young, a nigga truly blessed if he turn 21
Ill neva turn my back on my niggas from da crest, and I put da momma and my unborn son
Crest where I’m from, dats real tung, straight up out da slum, and my word is my bond
I rob wit my gun and I con wit my tongue, if a nigga still breathin den da job ain’t done
Everything we serve A-1, still sellin jays straight drop dat make dey mouth feel numb
Still throwin big barbeques at da park, if u ain’t from my hood den yo ass can't come
Me and my niggas we like brothers, talkin bout hustle down for each otha
We ain’t tussle touch or tongue wrestle wit a nigga, we gone buss em off da muhfuckin muscle
Nigga gotta hustle nigga gotta struggle, makin power moves gotta use a lil muscle
Gotta keep a tool, you a fool, if you think dat da straight drop crew ain’t gone mothafuckin buss you
Tight like brothas, talkin bout hustle, if we don’t know you den we sho don’t trust you
Just might touch ya, cuz we feel like fuck ya, deres a lot of niggas getting killed on custer

I might go out and play
Drop top Porsche and it's grey
I'm disgusting with these diamonds need to work on my manners
Mixed matched outfits three different designers
Man my pinky ring so bright you can see it from China
And I ain't even have to tell you that the kid is a grinder

Don’t need no clowns in my circle, this is not a circus
I keep on doin’ what I’m doin’, what I’m doin’ workin’
They say the watch on my wrist is picture perfect
They say the way I hold the pot is picture perfect
I left the lot and dropped the top cuz tops they make me nervous
I got the game, all I got, my life and my verses
And all that sneaky bitch shit, it came to the surface
Just to wake up it’s a blessed day
But I’m boomin’ cage like everyday
Gonna muscle down I put my hustle down
I gone makin’ money like several ways
Got a traphouse in the neighborhood
Get my grass cut by seven J’s
Flashback, yellow Lamborghini
I pulled up to the figure eight
Got a book man, I’m the coupe man
Get the S-scrolls, I’m extra paid
I pulled up in that Rolls Royce
All the pussy niggas had nothin’ to say
Cockroaches in the industry
I think it’s time for me to fumigate
Asenzi committed when I get through those pretty J’s
Might buy a pain, I might crack a seal
Then pour for my ace of spades
Might buy a pound and then break it down
Then smoke a pound in the VIP
I get money, you ain’t gettin’ money, is that the reason you mad at me?
Got fifty bags of that Cali gas
And it's all free if you find a seed
If you ain’t get no money, nigga, what’s yo purpose?
Don’t need no clowns in my circle, this is not a circus
I keep on doin’ what I’m doin’, what I’m doin’ workin’
They say the watch on my wrist is picture perfect
They say the way I hold the pot is picture perfect
I left the lot and dropped the top cuz tops they make me nervous
I got the game, all I got, my life and my verses
And all that sneaky bitch shit, it came to the surface
I hope she get so wet I get a backstroke
And fuck a nigga, what the fuck you think these scraps fo'?
Yeah, I be ballin’, and I ain’t talkin’ ball back
Big money, start talkin’ lil money fall back
Show me where them brawls at, show me where the mall at
Chill with the shit, bitch, show me where the staul at
Look at all this work, I don’t think that I can move it all
Look at all this dope, I don’t think that I can sell it all
Yeah, I’m tellin’ ya, big cookin’ work in the kitchen, I’m smellin’ ya
Shout out to the east cuz I be there on the regular
Yeah, we call em squares but their shapes are rectangular

So you could watch the show chillin' at your crib
And weeks turn to months, and months turn to years
But I be smoking dro, Ima fuck some hoes

Thinkin' bout me like I'm down the street

Pull up in South Beach blowing on trees
Whipping down the street like I'm riding on D's
A new ferrari flying down Peachtree
Girl I might roll ya window down Gucci Mane please
Make sure 2010 I'm free,fall off in the booth like 1017
Before I'm through fire jumping out the roof but we dont need water please bring more weed
Niggas can't win now they wanna switch teams, can't entertain that by no means
You wanna get on nigga chase your dreams,stop chasing me down like a dope fiend
Starting off my day with an M-16, shit ain't been the same since I turned 16
My whole life changed, now it's so icy

Ex-cell mate gotta 35 piece, won't be released till 2033

Question of the day: What car are you gonna drive today?
Money's not a problem, I'm booked up 'till the month of May
Million dollar man, call me Gucci Dibiase
Every week, come to the mall, rein'-up Versace
So if you hatin' on Gucci Mane, gon' and get in line
No matter what you drivin', don't park your car next to mine
And if you can't see all these diamonds, then you colorblind

Smoke so much kush that I need a 'dro card
Sell so much coke that I got a snow award
Hit the car lot like "Fuck that shit, give me two of these"
Then, dropped the top late night to feel the summer breeze
I got her sellin' blow for me, no time
It's like I stuck my dick in a gold mine
Red bottom shoes, and they match the red Chevy
I'm the quarterback, I might just throw a Hail Mary

Show my ass like I got my pants down
All my fans say that I'm the man, hands down
Diamonds dancin' on my hand, do the James Brown
Smokin' kush straight out the pound, I need to change towns
'Rari crawlin' down the street like a centipede
Ballin' like I'm in the league, but I'm not in the league
Got Jamaicans, and they cut that weed down by the tree
Fuck who it profit if that shit don't profit me
26's got the donk lookin' like it got hydraulics
So, if you ain't talkin' money, nigga, change the topic

Woke up in the morning and start bustin swishas
They ask me how it taste, I say it taste delicious
Early in the morning and I'm drinkin liquor
They ask me how I feel, I said I feel terrific
Woke up in the morning, had to make decisions
Jet, Beamer, Vette, Bentley or the fuckin Benzes
I don't know which one to pick and that shit feels terrific
May your next move be your best move
Make your best move be the right, mane

My car collection is critical
Yea I'm sorry, I'm like Stevie Wonder

Sorry I've been so disrespectful

Industry port is too political
Pull up in my car, not typical
I'm a business man with a business plan
Used to whip it in the park for the extra bands
Stir stir stir for the extra grams

Take the grinds on my hand and I make a fan
Take the bands off my hand then I make you dance
Got a cover and a plug like a avalanche
Swag so sick call it everlast

Got no friends, I got no sense

Yea these horsemen so get this junction
All red Rari, it's a pumpkin

All my hoes sell blow for me
All my hoes on go for me
Never gon get caught hopefully
Get caught burned out instantly
All money I ever seen, put me in position I never been
Countin up that 50 green, my truck rollin like 50 blings
And I don't pay er money, I just buy er clothes

Hit the break, urt skrt rims dancin'
A stock Porsche Carrera, I'mma paint it orange
It might be hood, but it's still foreign
I might be rollin' on one of them thangs
A candy painted six, sittin' on them thangs 
Hummer truck or drop top, I got choices
Rims all white, same color forces
Lamb so low, it's like it's snorklin'
My very freaky girl and it's insides are gorgeous
My Rims are dancing like a go-go dancer
One's goin' forward and one's goin' backwards
Put your fingers down there'll chop your damn hands up
Gave my rims a tip because they're real good dancers
A Black ass nigga in a old school classic
I pulled up to club Gucci Mama doin' the pool palace
And now they doin' the snake and cabbage patchey
Sittin' on davins, watch me spin backwards
My rims are strippers and they dancin' nasty
If you wanna pair, then you know you gotta cash-in
You need a motor run, a new transmission
Homeboy, you're trippin', your car game, is slippin'
This card right here, it doesn't have a limit
Gucci is a trapstar; how did Gucci get it?
A drop Ferrari and it sure ain't rented
Ask me where I bought it from, where other niggas can't get it
My Rims are dancing like a go-go dancer

Be jealous if she leave, uh 
But you deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby

And I can't hold you back, baby
Damn, I think I love her, but I don't really know her good
Know I wanna fuck her, but really thinking if I should
How can I believe her? I don't even believe myself
Tell me how to trust her, I can't even trust myself
And I can't live alone, at the end of the day, can't fuck myself
I told her I'm confused and she told me to go fuck myself
Now I'm alone in this world, nothing left but me
But I was born all alone, so I guess that's how it's meant to be
But she was sent to me, and I didn't recognize
And I blame it on my pride on the fact I'm sittin' in silence
Eyes redder than a rose, heart bluer than a violet
My heart broke and I'm heartless and ain't no need to hide it
Gucci
I know that I need her 
But don't know how to treat her 
But you deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
You deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby

I think I love her I don't know
I like her a lot, but she loco
She crazy, swagged out

In and out of town all the time
She in and out my mind all the time
I can't lie baby girl stupid fine
But I'm out the tush got that stupid grind
She loves me now or she loves me not
Treat me cold or she treat me hot
Caramel, but not apricot
Got one chance, won't miss the shot
I know she special, yeah, a lot
I know someone might take ma spot
Can't lie, it may hurt a lot
But uh, she need a man or not 
I know that I need her

But you deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
You deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby

Be jealous if she leave, uh

This nigga think he really got a freak, but mind is 'Do the fool'
We get to the room, I let him rub, I let him get a lil' touch
I told him hold up stop, let me go to the bathroom freshen up
I went out the bathroom window, met with Gucci, Glock in purse
Kicked in the do', shot him in his head, took his cheese and left him murked

Hang wit the thug boys, nicknamed the Goon Squad

And that was yesterday, I’m ballin’ like a Patriot
I give her dirt, you say you’re drinking ‘cause I paid for it
But I’m so rich, bitch, that it ain’t really cost me shit
They let the boss in this bitch, I’m spillin’ sauce ’n' shit
I’m Mr. Forbes list bitch, I got a costly dick
Your baby momma in the booth suckin’ sausages
I’m gettin’ my dick sucked in my office sippin’ coffee, bitch 
She got a lot, she gettin’ paid
Bust it open, watch her work the stage
Slidin’ down the pole like she’s finna for the fire
You smoke her out, I get the bitch higher
Hotties clappin’ that ass for cash
Bitch nigga I’m throwin’ bags
Poppin’ bottles, throwin’ dollars
Gin down the throat, make that bitch swallow
Make her twerk while I’m puffin' purp'
She gon’ make your pockets hurt
Dance so freaky, I like it raw
But Juciy J ain’t Dirt McGirt
This look like the Player’s Club
Plus they all be showing love
VIP with the ratchet bitches
Shakin’ ass, off the drugs 
They love me in the club
‘cause they know I’m tippin’
She might leave with a coupe
That’s just how I’m feelin’

First I let her drive it, then I let her ride me
I charged a nigga $40,000 just to stand beside me
 Now that’s a stupid check
Gave 40 to Tity Boi and now I got that stupid pack
On I-20 wit duffle bags, yeah, I shock a bitch 
Two million dollars cash money, damn, man, that’s ludicrous
I love to ball wit bougie broads, it’s big Gucci, yeah I’m a dog

Smoking thrax in the back with your girl, what you say about that
If you ever run up, get your wig pushed back
In the club on the trap, it’s a fact, what you say about that
Popped so many bottles, I should be a bartender
So much cash on me that I should be a money lender
Moved so many pounds, they think that I’m a bodybuilder
What I spent last night, I could’ve bought an Audi, nigga
Bet a hundred chickens I don’t get no recognition
But fuck some recognition, I just want them hundred chickens
Slapped the top of my new girl like I’m an Indian
My only wish is that them bricks go back to ten again
Wake up, couldn’t cake up, got a king size in my kitchen
Bad bitch, no make-up, neighbors minding their business
In the roof, long face up, in six days or you missing
Don’t pay up, won’t wake up, and leave you sleeping with the fishes
It’s a well known fact that I keep big straps
Got them things in my bookbag and I’ma bust back
When lil’ mama seen my watch, baby had a heart attack
Got a Ziploc full of mollies, I call it the party pack
I’m my own fan, I’ma meet myself, so much money, got to treat myself
Call me old school , put rims on then I called it a day
Heard that Gucci Mane and them getting money, got ten cars but the show want twenty
Rims so big but the top so skinny, stand next to me, yeah it’ll cost you twenty
Mind your business, don’t cost you any, hold on, wait one goddamn minute
Gucci Mane came in a drop top Bentley, switched up, came in a hard top Benzi
Cool as a fool but sure ain’t friendly, worth more than a pool with no goddamn diamonds
Won’t stop rapping ‘til a nigga start shining,  still trapping so a nigga still grindingMy inside ostrich, outside candy

Rims pimped out what the fuck I need Xzibit for?
Change lanes then change hues, from light green to donk blue
Yeah the paint chameleon so they swagger and they change too
Shine harder, grind harder, Air Ones look like tap water
Chrome wheels look like silver quarters and my see-through top like bathwater 
26 inches and the rims look like pickle juice

Jumped in the hot tob, shawty off the bentley coupe

Yeah, I'm Gucci Mane La'Flare, Call me Delta Airlines 'cause I'm sittin' in the air

Million dollars worth of notes already done counted it

Rims cut the eyes

I push weight, but Gucci don't exercise
I get extra from whippin' up extra pies
I’m in the hood like the mayor round election time
It's a suggestion, don't park your car next to mine
I’ma start when the light hit, I’m 'posed to shine
Your flow is garbage, they let me out just in time
They got a section, but none of the hoes are fine
They need to exit, don't let the grind pass you by
I run laps around lames with my shoes untied
I jump the line, walk in, and watch the crowd divide
Still stuck outside, that's the ugly side
Looked medusa in the eye and medusa died
This is top secret shit, classified
Don't blame me, Swizz was the mastermind
Can't breathe, can't breathe, Toni Braxton time
I got my chain moonwalkin', Michael Jackson time
I keep on buying ice like I lost my mind
This bloodline of mine is supposed to shine
My pocket on swole, my rims on chrome
When I hit the club, everything goes
Bottles in the air, put your lighters in the air
But when I'm in here, I don’t really care
'Cause I ride on em, I style on em

Yeah I know, that’s the way you like it, huh, yeah
That’s the way you love me, huh? It’s alive, it’s alive

I'm an East Atlanta rider
You gon' fuck around and get ya whole clique tied up
My brain fried; I'm on the skull of the Impala
I'm high on kush, it's 'bout my money mixed with power
So keep it brief
Nigga, two hundred thousand in the fleece
Pistols, two hundred twenty on the dash
System, I pull off it look like a flash
Picture, cheeeeeese!
I got the 24's, those 74 for 2's
When you was on the stage, Gucci was on the news
But bitch don't pity me, I look like Mr. T
I pimp like Soulja Slim, but I think I'm Eazy-E
It's Gucci
Patty cake, patty cake, I hop around with pancakes

I'm from Clayon County, Riverdale so I'm supposed to give 'em hell

You too late, I'll be damned you take this dinner off our plate
Dirty Birds, Dirty Birds, twenty-one gun salute and got killed
It's Bankhead Brick Squad out in U.K., these niggas ain't fuckin with me
Mob up off that run day, SK's, AK's
Throwaways I let that triple up like {?} triple beam we crackin

Hard from the start; I ain't never been no fuckin lame
Here I go with Waka Flocka, here I go with Gucci Mane
One of a kind - that Memphis 10 runnin through my bloodstream
Ghetto superstar - man them hood bitches love me
Cup full of that ol' purple drank, pullin on some of that stanky dank
Pocket full of Benny Frank and bitch, what the fuck you thank?
45 hollowheads in my stout, yellow purt{?}
I hope one of these ol' bitch bitch-ass niggas don't cross that line and get hurt
Money what we came to get, money what we represent
You ain't talkin 'bout shit if you ain't talkin 'bout gettin it
Hard hustle never fold, forever I will be cold
Forever I will be big Ball, mouth full of goldTell 'em what you drinkin'

Got a girl at the blaze, snort a ounce a day
She want a Amaretto cocktail but boy get straight
Baby say she want a party, I brought a cake
Told her clean the plate, she can't feel her face
In the club, you can spot us from a mile away
Diamonds in the rain look like Alize
Diamonds in my chain look like Ocean Spray
And the stones ain't cloudy, I make it rain

A nigga just front me 10 keys
I’mma run up on a nigga on feet
Gotta get back on my feet
Choppa knock a nigga off of his feet
Jump a nigga, stomp his ass with my feet
Red bottoms on the bottom of my cleats
The only nigga in a Phantom on feets
Touch me and you’ll be 6 feet deep
Feet!
Bougie ass club, they let a crook in this bitch
Take a deuce to a fo', I put my foot in this shit!
They say that Gucci Mane be flexin' unbelievable price
And I know that life is priceless, but I pay for your life
I think I’m Dirty Harry, nigga, when I got that .45
And I can never respect a man that can’t look me in my eyes
Just as stupid as these rappers if you believe the lies
You bring a knife to a gunfight, yo' ass wanna die!
I’m not a rapper, I’m a trapper in a rapper disguise
I put the feets on ya, leave a Reebok print on ya eye
I put the feets on the plug, cause his price is too high
I’m showin' my feet, Louis flip flops, I’m way in Dubai 
Apply pressure, got they neck, I got my foot on it
V12 car, got my foot on it
Gucci cleats, on my feet
Gooc and me, we run the streets
Walk it like I talk it, play it how I got it
Ain’t a phony bone on me homie, bitch you can X-ray my toes
Good in e'er hood, we run the town
A Thousand niggas throwin' up B’s, 10 toes down
I ain’t jump off the porch, I leaped in the streets
Real street cats always land on they feet
Born a standup guy, that’s all I ever knew
You can tell a rich nigga just look at his shoes!
Tarantino!
