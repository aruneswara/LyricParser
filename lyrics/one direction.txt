I might never be your knight in shining armor
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight
When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now
I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time
When I first saw you, from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now
And if you like cameras flashing every time we go out, oh yeah
And if you're looking for someone
To write your breakup songs about
Baby, I'm perfect
Baby, we're perfect
If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right nowI've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul, and baby, you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah

I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen 
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life 
Written on these walls are the colours that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning, now
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holding on so tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life 
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life 
And I been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you
Is like chasing the clouds
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen

You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh, oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful
So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Keep getting the feeling you wanna leave this all behind
Thought we were going strong
I thought we were holding on
Aren't we?
No, they don't teach you this in school
Now my heart's breaking and I don't know what to do
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Aren't we?
You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever
All of the rumours, all of the fights
But we always find a way to make it out alive
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Aren't we?
You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever
Minibars, expensive cars
Hotel rooms, and new tattoos
The good champagne and private planes
But they don't mean anything
'Cause the truth is out, I realize
That without you here, life is just a lie
This is not the end, this is not the end
We can make it, you know it, you know
You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

We can live forever
Baby don't you know, baby don't you know
We can live foreverGoing out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you
Going out tonight, changes into something red, her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby, it will never change, baby
It will never change, me and youYour hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind it was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes
When you smile, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I’ll love them endlessly
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
Maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things
You never love yourself half as much as I love you
And you'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh
And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh it's you, it's you they add up to
And I'm in love with you and all these little things
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you they add up to
I'm in love with you, and all your little thingsIf I could fly
I'd be coming right back home to you
I think I might give up everything
Just ask me to
Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now, I'm completely defenseless
For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only
I've got scars
Even though they can't always be seen
And pain gets hard
But now you're here and I don't feel a thing
Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now, I'm completely defenseless
For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only

I've been going out of my mind
Know that I'm just wasting time, and I
Hope that you don't run from me

For your eyes onlyDown to Earth
Keep on falling when I know it hurts
Going faster than a million miles an hour
Tryna catch my breath some way, somehow
Down to Earth
It's like I'm frozen, but the world still turns
Stuck in motion, and the wheels keep spinning 'round
Moving in reverse with no way out
And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you
How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity
Eyes can't shine
Unless there's something burning bright behind
Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine
I feel myself running out of time
And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you
How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity

How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay

If I tried, I know it would feel like Infinity 
Infinity , Infinity, yeah
InfinityI got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both
We made a start, be it a false one I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
We took a chance, God knows we've tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink, oh love
Let's split the night wide open
And we'll see everything we can
Living love in slow motion, motion, motion
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
When we were eighteen
Oh Lord, when we were eighteen
Kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteenI figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
They never tried like us
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
'Cause you and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end 
Nothing can come between you and I 
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us 
No, nothing can come between you and I
You and I
Oh, you and I
Oh, you and I
We could make it if we try, you and I
Oh, you and IRemember the day we were giving up
When you told me I didn't give you enough
And all of your friends were saying I'd be leaving you
She's lying in bed with my t-shirt on

Don't let me go, don't let me go
Say what you're feeling and say it now
'Cause I got the feeling you're walking out
And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing ya
The consequences of falling out
Are something I’m having nightmares about
And these are the reasons I'm crying out to be with ya
Please believe me, don't you see

All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M

Won't you stay 'til the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations

I'm like a boat on the water
You're the raise on the waves that calm my mind, oh, every time
But I know in my heart
You're not a constant star
And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for you
Fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for you
Fool's gold
I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty, and I can't see two feet in front of me
And I know in my heart
You're just a moving part
And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet, falling for you
Fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met

Fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling for you
Fool's goldStained coffee cup
Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough
Sweet, where you lay
Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case
Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun, I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious, I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control
Taste, on my tongue
I don't want to wash away the night before
In the heat, where you lay
I could stay right here and burn in it all day
Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun, I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious, I just can't get enough of you

I'm watching her dance, dress is catching the light
In her eyes there's no lies, no lies
There's no question, she's not in a disguise
With no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you, too close now
Through the wire, through the wire
What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down
But you've got stars, they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now
Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching you like this, imagining you're mine
It's too late, it's too late, am I too late?
Tell me now, am I running out of time?
With no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you, too close now

Whatever chains are holding you back
Holding you back, don't let 'em tie you down
Whatever change is holding you back
Holding you back, tell me you believe in that
What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms

It's impossible to know if after this we can still be friends, yeah
I know you're saying you don't wanna hurt me, well maybe you should show a little mercy
The way you look, I know you didn't come to apologise
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, why you wearing that to walk out of my life?
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, even though it's over you should stay tonight

If tomorrow you won't be mine, won't you give it to me one last time?
Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye
Unforgettable together, held the whole world in our hands
Unexplainable, a love that only we could understand, yeah
I know there's nothing I can do to change it, but is there something that can be negotiated?
My heart's already breaking, baby, go on twist the knife

One more taste of your lips just to bring me back
To the places we've been and the nights we've had
Because if this is it then at least we could end it right

She belongs to meA week ago you said to me
"Do you believe I'll never be too far?"
If you're lost, just look for me
You'll find me in the region of the summer stars
The fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye
Means we've already won
A necessity for apologies between you and me
Baby, there is none
We had some good times, didn't we?
We had some good tricks up our sleeve
Goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end, I'll see your face again
You will find me, yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind, walking in the wind
Yesterday, I went out
To celebrate the birthday of a friend
But as we raised our glasses up to make a toast
I realised you were missing
We had some good times, didn't we?
We wore our hearts out on our sleeve
Goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end, I'll see your face again
You will find me, yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind, walking in the wind
I know we'll be alright, child
Just close your eyes and see
I'll be by your side
Any time you're needing me, oh yeah
You will find me, yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind, walking in the wind
Walking in the windI told her that I loved her, was not sure if she heard
The roof was pretty windy and she didn't say a word
Party dying downstairs, had nothing left to do
Just me, her and the moon
I said you're on fire, babe
Then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure
All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
At the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
She said the night was over, I said it's forever
20 minutes later, wound up in the hospital
The priest thinks it's the devil, my mum thinks it's the flu
But, girl, it's only you
I said you're on fire, babe
Then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure
All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
When the sun goes down I
Know that you and me and everything will be alright
And when the city's sleeping
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming
All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
At the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
You're the one that I want at the end of the daySaw your body language and I know how you're feeling
You look like the kind of girl who's tired of speaking
Standing with somebody
But he doesn't know what you like
You caught my attention, you were looking at me first
All that I can see is you waking up in my t-shirt
If you're not hooked to anything
Right now, I can be your vice
All you need to know is
You can call me when you're lonely
When you can't sleep, I'll be your temporary fix
You control me, even if it's just tonight
You can call me when you feel like
I'm your good time, I'll be your temporary fix
You can own me, and we'll call this what you like
Let me be your good night
The night is on your lips and I feel like I'm locked in
There's a million lights, I don't care if they're watching
Your body's saying everything
I don't have to read your mind
Feel you on my neck while I'm calling a taxi
Climbing over me while I climb in the backseat
Now we're taking off
Now we're taking it off tonight
All you need to know is
You can call me when you're lonely
When you can't sleep, I'll be your temporary fix
You control me, even if it's just tonight
You can call me when you feel like
I'm your good time, I'll be your temporary fix
You can own me, and we'll call this what you like
Let me be your good night
We can roll in the darkness
Let me touch you where your heart is
And if you're feeling the weakness
Well I told you, baby, that you can call me
I'll be your temporary fix, you can call me
You can call me when you're lonely
When you can't sleep, I'll be your temporary fix
You control me, even if it's just tonight
You can call me when you feel like
I'm your good time, I'll be your temporary fix
You can own me, and we'll call this what you like
Let me be your good nightSaid I’d never leave her 'cause her hands fit like my t-shirt
Tongue tied over three words, cursed
Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips
Now she’s feeling so low since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo
And it’s no joke to me
So can we do it all over again?
If you’re pretending from the start like this with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again
Again we take the same road
Two days in the same clothes
And I know just what she’ll say if I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell that your heart isn’t in it or with it
Tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we’re together or apart
We can both remove the masks and admit we regret it from the start
If you’re pretending from the start like this with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again
You’ll never know how to make it on your own
And you’ll never show weakness for letting go
I guess it's still hard if the seed's sown
But do you really want to be alone?
If you’re pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again
If you’re pretending from the start like this with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over againPeople say we shouldn’t be together
Too young to know about forever
But I say they don’t know
What they talk talk talking about
'Cause this love is only getting stronger
So I don’t wanna wait any longer
I just wanna tell the world that you're mine girl,
Oh
They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the I love you’s
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all nights
They don’t know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they don’t know about, they don’t know about us
Just one touch and I was a believer
Every kiss it gets a little sweeter
It’s getting better
Keeps getting better all the time girl
They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the I love you’s
But I bet you if they only knew 
They would just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all nights
They don’t know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they don’t know about, they don’t know about us
They don’t know how special you are
They don’t know what you’ve done to my heart
They can say anything they want
'Cause they don’t know about us
They don’t know what we do best
That’s between me and you, our little secret
But I wanna tell 'em
I wanna tell the world that you're mine girl
They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the I love you’s
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all nights
They don’t know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they don’t know about, they don’t know about us
They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the I love you’s
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all nights 
They don’t know I've waited all my life 
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they don’t know about, they don’t know about us
They don’t know about usMaybe it's the way she walked
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards
Just like she already owned it
I said, "Can you give it back to me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes
Said her name was Georgia Rose
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth 
But she kissed me like she meant it
I said, "Can I take you home with me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes
You know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me
And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced, how we danced

How we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
We danced, we danced
And it goes something like this
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her

I think it went oh, oh, oh

Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never gonna get away?
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But I fear I'm getting used to being held by you
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, look what you've done now
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, you got me tied down
Baby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 
Who's this man that's holding your hand and talking 'bout your eyes? 
Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind 
I know they'll be coming to find me soon 
But my Stockholm Syndrome is in your room
Yeah, I fell for you
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, look what you've done now
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, you got me tied down
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 
All my life I've been on my own 
I used the light to guide me home 
But now together we're alone 
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go
Baby, look what you've done
Baby, look what you've done to me
Baby, look what you've done now
Baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 
Baby, look what you've done to me 
Baby, you got me tied down

One as beautiful as you are sweet
With just a hint of pain for the feeling that I get when you are gone
I wanna write you a song
I wanna lend you my coat
One that's as soft as your cheek
So when the world is cold you will have a hiding place you can go
I wanna lend you my coat
Everything I need I get from you
And giving back is all I wanna do
I wanna build you a boat
One as strong as you are free
So any time you think that your heart is gonna sink, you know it won't
I wanna build you a boat
Everything I need I get from you
And giving back is all I wanna do
Everything I need I get from you
And giving back is all I wanna do
I wanna write you a song
One to make your heart remember me
So any time I'm gone, you can listen to my voice and sing along
I wanna write you a song
I wanna write you a songStraight off the plane to a new hotel
Just touched down, you could never tell
Big house party with a crowded kitchen
People talk shh but we don't listen
Tell me that I'm wrong, but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh whoa
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh
Baby, you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh, oh, oh
Anywhere we go
Never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it
5 foot something with the skinny jeans
Don't look back, baby, follow me
I don't know where I'm going but I'm finding my way
Same old shh but a different day
Tell me that I'm wrong, but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee

But when I'm looking at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep making me weak
Yeah, frozen, and can't breathe
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing
Now I'm climbing the walls
But you don't notice at all
That I'm going out of my mind
All day and all night
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to know your name
And I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead

Oh, I wish I could be more like you

Do you wish you could be more like me?
Oh, I wish I could be more like you
Oh, I wish I could be more, I could be more, I could be more

Backseat of my car, in the back of my head
I come alive when I hear your voice
It's a beautiful sound, it's a beautiful noise

Wanna stay up and party the weekend away and not know when to quit
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth and go over the edge
Wanna wake up with you and say, "Baby, let's do it all over again"
Lips so good I forget my name
I swear I could give you everything
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it
I just can't get too much of you, baby
It's never, it's never enough
Never enough
It's never enough
Never enough
Come on, come on
Wanna pull an all nighter and get into something we'll never forget
Wanna stay up and party the weekend away and not know when to quit

Come on, come on
Come on, come onMy hands, your hands, tied up like two ships
Drifting, weightless, waves try to break it
I'd do anything to save it
Why is it so hard to say it?
My heart, your heart, sit tight like bookends
Pages between us written with no end
So many words we're not saying
Don't wanna wait 'til it's gone
You make me strong
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?
That you make me strong?
Think of how much love that's been wasted
People always trying to escape it
Move on to stop their heart breaking
But there's nothing I'm running from
You make me strong
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?
So, baby, hold on to my heart, yeah
Need you to keep me from falling apart
I'll always hold on
'Cause you make me strong
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?
That you make me strong?
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?Counted all my mistakes and there's only one
Standing out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go
So I built you a house from a broken home
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
It took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go?
Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
Is at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is running in circles of you and me
Anyone in between is the enemy
Shadows come with the pain that you're running from
Love was something you never heard enough
Yeah, it took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Are you sleeping baby by yourself
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go?
Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me where you go when you feel afraid
Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me, will you ever love me again, love me again?
]
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Are you sleeping baby by yourself
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go? Tell me where you're hiding out
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go? Tell me 'cause I'm 10 feet down
Where do broken hearts go? Come on baby, come and get me out
Come on baby, come and get me out
Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go?Make a little conversation, so long I've been waiting
To let go of myself and feel alive
So many nights I thought it over, told myself I kind of liked her
But there was something missing in her eyes
I was stumbling
Looking in the dark  with an empty heart
But you say you feel the same
Could we ever be enough?  Baby, we could be enough
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way, I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home
So hot that I couldn't take it, wanna wake up and see your face
And remember how good it was being here last night
Still high with a little feeling, I see the smile as it starts to creep in
It was there, I saw it in your eyes
I was stumbling
Looking in the dark  with an empty heart
But you say you feel the same
Could we ever be enough?  Baby, we could be enough
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way, I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home
I'll make this feel like home
Baby, we could be enough
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way, I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like homeI hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you
I feel the waves getting started
It's a rush inside I can't control
Your eyes keep pulling me in
And I know, I know, I know
Your friends all talk about me
They say I got no chance at all
But your fire is burning deep
In my soul, my soul, my soul
I ain't up for debating
Ain't in it for the taking
You got the whole world shaking
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I try to take them down
We can run and hide, ain't going down without a fight
I hear them calling for you, I hear them calling
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart, they come straight for your heart
I hear them calling for you, I hear them calling for you
I keep on holding tight now
'Cause your body's telling me don't let go
We're gonna be starting up trouble
I know, I know, I know
Just bringing my demons out
More than ever now
Your beauty could start a war
As you walk in the door
I ain't up for debating
Ain't in it for the taking
We got the whole world shaking
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I try to take them down
We can run and hide, ain't going down without a fight
I hear them calling for you, I hear them calling
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart, they come straight for your heart

You've been sleeping with my sweater
And that you can't stop missing me
Bet my friend's been telling you I'm not doing much better
Because I'm missing half of me
And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to
Only half a blue sky
Kinda there but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man at best
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you
Forget all we said that night
No, it doesn't even matter
'Cause we both got split in two
If you could spare an hour or so
We'll go for lunch down by the river
We can really talk it through
And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to
Only half a blue sky
Kinda there but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man at best
With half an arrow in my chest
'Cause I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you
Half a heart without you
I'm half a heart without you
Though I try to get you out of my head
The truth is, I got lost without you
And since then, I've been waking up to
Only half a blue sky 
Kinda there but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man at best 
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you
Without you, without you, half a heart without you
Without you, without you
I'm half a heart without youHey girl, I'm waiting on you, I'm waiting on you

Something deep inside me, I can't give up
I think I'm gonna lose my mind
I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck
Yeah, I roll and I roll 'til I’m out of luck
I'm feeling something deep inside
Hotter than a jet stream burning up
I got a feeling deep inside
It's taking, it's taking, all I've got
Yeah, it's taking, it's taking, all I've got
'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
It's been so long, it's been so long, maybe we're fireproof

I think I'm gonna win this time
Riding on the wind and I won't give up
I think I'm gonna win this time

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do

And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
(It's been so long, it's been so long, maybe we're fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do)We made a fire, went down in the flames
We sailed an ocean and drowned in the waves
Built a cathedral, but we never prayed
We had it all, yeah and we walked away
Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you but I struggle 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm falling
It's a long way down
It's a long way down from here
We had a mountain, but took it for granted
We had a spaceship, but we couldn't land it
We found an island, but we got stranded
We had it all yeah, who could've planned it?
Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you, but I'm struggling 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm falling
It's a long way down from here
Such a long way down from here
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
Such a long way down
It's a long way down
It's a long way downBetter than words, more than a feeling
Crazy in love, dancing on the ceiling
Every time we touch, I'm all shook up
You make me wanna, how deep is your love? God only knows, baby

Wanna go back there every night
Just can't lie, was the best time of my life
Lying on the beach as the sun blew out
Playing this guitar by the fire too loud
Oh my, my, they could never shut us down
I used to think that I was better alone
Why did I ever wanna let you go?
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea
The words you whispered, I will always believe
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
We were together, summer '09
Wanna roll back like pressing rewind
You were mine and we never said goodbye
I used to think that I was better alone 
Why did I ever wanna let you go? 
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea
The words you whispered I will always believe

What you do to me when you hold his hand
We were meant to be, but a twist of fate
Made it so we had to walk away
'Cause we're on fire
We are on fire, we're on fire now
Yeah, we're on fire
We are on fire, we're on fire now 
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave, so c'mon
Baby, be with me so happily
It's four A.M. and I know that you're with him
I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin
And if he feels my traces in your hair
Sorry, love, but I don't really care

We are on fire, we're on fire now
Yeah, we're on fire

As it takes just to save a saviour, oh, woah, woah, woah
Now, she floats through the room on a big balloon
Some say she’s such a fake, that her love is made up, no, no, no, no
Let’s have another toast to the girl almighty
Let’s pray we stay young, stay made of lightning

I hear voices singing songs in the street and I know
That we won't be going home
For so long, for so long, but I know
That I won't be on my own
Yeah, I love this feeling and
Right now, I wish you were here with me
'Cause right now, everything is new to me
You know I can't fight the feeling
And every night, I feel it
Right now, I wish you were here with me
Late night spaces with all our friends, you and me, yeah
Love these faces, just like how it used to be
And we won't be going home
For so long, for so long, but I know
I won't be on my own, on my own, I'm feeling like

Right now, I wish you were here with meOoh
I’m broken, do you hear me?
I’m blinded 'cause you are everything I see
I’m dancing alone, I’m praying
That your heart will just turn around
And as I walk up to your door
My head turns to face the floor
'Cause I can’t look you in the eyes and say
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won’t feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don’t feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
Can love you more than this
If I’m louder, would you see me?
Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me?
'Cause we are the same, you save me
When you leave, it’s gone again
And then I see you on the street
In his arms, I get weak
My body fails, I’m on my knees, praying
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won’t feel right
'cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don’t feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
Yeah
I’ve never had the words to say
But now I’m asking you to stay for a little while inside my arms
And as you close your eyes tonight
I pray that you will see the light
That’s shining from the stars above

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won’t feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this

I wanna be with you, I wanna feel your love
I wanna lay beside you
I cannot hide this, even though I try
Heart beats harder, time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face
If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me today
Close the door, throw the key
Don't wanna be reminded, don't wanna be seen
Don't wanna be without you
My judgement's clouded like tonight's sky
Hands are silent, voice is numb
Try to scream out, my lungs
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face
If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me today
Flashing lights in my mind, going back to the time
Playing games in the street, kicking balls with my feet
There's a numb in my toes, standing close to the edge
There's a pile of my clothes at the end of your bed
As I feel myself fall, make a joke of it all
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me today
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me todayYou tell me that you’re sad and lost your way
You tell me that your tears are here to stay
But I know you were only hiding
And I just wanna see you
You tell me that you're hurt and you're in pain
And I can see your head is held in shame
But I just wanna see you smile again
See you smile again
But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It'll come back to you
And I'll be here for you
Oh, I will carry you over
Fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way
Through the dark
I wish that I could take you to the stars
I'd never let you fall and break your heart
And if you wanna cry or fall apart
I'll be there to hold you
You tell me that you're hurt, it's all in vain
But I can see your heart can love again
And I remember you laughing
So let's just laugh again
But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It'll come back to you
Back to you
Oh, I will carry you over
Fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way
Through the dark
And you don't need, you don't need to run
And you will see it's easy to be loved
I know you wanna be loved
Oh, I will carry you over
Fire and water for your love
Oh, I will carry you over
Fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough

I've been all around the world
Seen a lot of faces
Never knowing where I was
On the horizon, mm, but I know, I know, I know, I know
The sun will be rising back home
Living out of cases
Packing up and taking off
Made a lot of changes
But not forgetting who I was
On the horizon, ooh, well I know, I know, I know, I know
The moon will be rising back home
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song
I've been away for ages
But I got everything I need
I'm flicking through the pages
I've written in my memory
I feel like I'm dreaming, oh, so I know, I know, I know, I know
That I'm never leaving, no, I won't go
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song
Lights off when they should be on
Even stars in the skies, they're wrong
Short days, when the nights are long
When I think of the things I've done
Don't matter how far I've gone
I'm always free to run home

That we should try to keep it simple
But love is never ever simple, no

Then there's me inside a sinking boat
Running out of time
Without you, I'll never make it out alive
But I know, yes I know, we'll be alright
There's a devil in your smile, it's chasing me
And every time I turn around, it's only gaining speed
There's a moment when you finally realize
There's no way you can change the rolling tide
But I know, yes I know that I'll be fine
This time I'm ready to run 
Escape from the city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run 
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young
I will never look back, now I'm ready to run
I'm ready to run
There's a future in my life I can't foresee
Unless of course I stay on course and keep you next to me
There will always be the kind that criticize
But I know, yes I know we'll be alright
This time I'm ready to run 
Escape from the city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run 
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young
I will never look back now I'm ready to run
This time I'm ready to run 
I’d give everything that I’ve got for your love
This time I'm ready to run
Escape from the city and follow the sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run 
Wherever you are is the place I belong

The front pages are your pictures, they make you look so small
How could someone not miss you at all?
I never would mistreat you, oh I'm not a criminal
I speak a different language, but I still hear your call
Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes

Baby, you'd be saving mineLately I found myself thinking, been dreaming about you a lot
And up in my head I’m your boyfriend, but that’s one thing you’ve already got
He drives to school every morning while I walk alone in the rain
He’d kill me without any warning if he took a look in my brain
Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would
Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would
Back in my head we were kissing, I thought things were going alright
With a sign on my back saying "Kick me," reality ruined my life 
Feels like I’m constantly playing a game that I’m destined to lose
'Cause I can’t compete with your boyfriend, he’s got 27 tattoos
Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would
Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would
I would
I would
Would he please you? Would he kiss you?
Would he treat you like I would? 
Would he touch you? Would he need you?
Would he love you like I would?
Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would
Would he please you?  Would he kiss you? 
Would he treat you like I would? 
Would he touch you?  Would he need you? 
Would he love you like I would? 
Would he say he’s in L-O-V-E?
Well if it was me then I would 
Would he hold you when you’re feeling low?
Baby you should know that I would, I would, yeah, I would, yeahIt feels like we've been living in fast forward

'Cause I move a little slow when I dance
I can count on you after all that we've been through
'Cause I know that you'll always understand
I won't act my age, no I won't act my age

I asked the doctor can you find out what is wrong with me
I don't know why I wanna be with every girl I meet
I can't control it, yeah, I know it's taking over me
I'm going crazy, can't contain it
So tell me just what I should do
She said, hey, it's alright, does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back, live your life, even if it's only for tonight
She said, hey, it's alright, if it makes you feel alive
Went to a party, just after the doctor talked to me
I met a girl, I took her hand up to the balcony
I whispered something in her ear that I just can't repeat
She said "Okay", but she was worried what her friends will think
She's going crazy, can't contain it
She asked me what should I do?
I said, hey, it's alright, does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back, live your life, even if it's only for tonight
I said, hey, it's alright, if it makes you feel alive
We got to live before we get older
Do what we like, we got nothing to lose
Shake off the weight of the world from your shoulders
Oh, we got nothing to prove
I said, hey, it's alright
Does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back, live your life
Even if it's only for tonight
I said, hey, it's alright, does it make you feel alive?
Don't look back, live your life, even if it's only for tonight
I said, hey, it's alright, if it makes you feel aliveWho's gonna be the first one to start the fight?
Who's gonna be the first one to fall asleep at night?
Who's gonna be the last one to drive away?
Who's gonna be the last one to forget this place?
We keep taking turns, will we ever learn?
Oh, spaces between us keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach ya even though I've tried
Spaces between us, hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless and I don't know why
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?
Who's gonna be the first one to compromise?
Who's gonna be the first one to set it all on fire?
Who's gonna be the last one to drive away?
Forgetting every single promise we ever made

Spaces between us, hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless and I don't know why
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?

The spaces between us
The spaces between us
The spaces between us
The spaces between usOne day you'll come into my world and say it all
You'll say we'll be together even when you're lost
One day you'll say these words I've thought but never said
You'll say we're better off together in our bed
I want you here with me like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining
Come on, jump out at me, come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?
The script was written and I could not change a thing
I want to rip it all to shreds and start again
One day I'll come into your world and get it right
I'll say we're better off together here tonight
I want you here with me like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining
Come on, jump out at me, come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?
I want you here with me like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining
Come on, jump out at me, come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?
I want you here with me like how I pictured it
Is it too much to ask for something great?
You're all I want
So much it's hurting
You're all I want
So much it's hurtingIf this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies
You say it's getting late, it's getting late
And you don't know if you can stay, if you can stay
But you, you don't tell the truth
No, you, you like playing games
Your hands touching me, they're touching me
And your eyes keep saying things
They're saying what we do when it's only me and you
I can't concentrate
That's all I'm thinking about, all I keep thinking about
Everything else just fades away
If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies
You say you're a good girl
But I know you would, girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your little white lies, little white lies
With your little white lies, little white lies
Back seat of the cab, we're in the cab
My lips getting so attached, they're so attached
Now you wanna make some rules
Now, cool, then we'll watch them break tonight
I know what you want
And I've been waiting so long
If this room was burning
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been taking up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies
You say you're a good girl
But I know you would, girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your little white lies, little white lies
With your little white lies, little white lies
I know you want it, I know you feel it too
Let's stop pretending
That you don't know what I don't know
Just what we came to do 
If this room was burning 
I wouldn't even notice 
'Cause you've been taking up my mind 
With your little white lies, little white lies 
You say you're a good girl 
But I know you would, girl 
'Cause you've been telling me all night 
With your little white lies, little white lies 
With your little white lies, little white liesOnce in a lifetime it’s just right
We made no mistakes
Not even a landslide or riptide
Could take it all away
Somehow it feels like nothing has changed
Right now my heart is beating the same
Out loud someone’s calling my name
It sounds like you
When I close my eyes
All the stars align
And you are by my side
You are by my side
Once in a lifetime it's just right
That we are always safe
Not even the bad guys in the dark night
Could take it all away
Somehow it feels like nothing has changed
Right now my heart is beating the same
Out loud someone’s calling my name
And it sounds like you
When I close my eyes
All the stars align
And you are by my side
You are by my side
You are by my side
You are by my side
Once in a lifetime you were mineAm I asleep, am I awake or somewhere in between?
I can’t believe that you are here and lying next to me
Or did I dream that we were perfectly entwined?
Like branches on a tree, or twigs caught on a vine
Like all those days and weeks and months I tried to steal a kiss
And all those sleepless nights and daydreams where I pictured this
I’m just the underdog who finally got the girl
And I am not ashamed to tell it to the world
Truly, madly, deeply I am, foolishly, completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So, baby, say you’ll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you, in love with you
Should I put coffee and granola on a tray in bed
And wake you up with all the words that I still haven’t said?
And tender touches just to show you how I feel
Or should I act so cool, like it was no big deal?
Wish I could freeze this moment in a frame and stay like this
I’ll put this day back on replay and keep reliving it
'Cause here’s the tragic truth, if you don’t feel the same
My heart would fall apart if someone said your name
And truly, madly, deeply I am, foolishly, completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So, baby, say you’ll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you
I hope I’m not a casualty
I hope you won’t get up and leave
Might not mean that much to you
But to me it’s everything, everything
Truly, madly, deeply I am, foolishly, completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So, baby, say you’ll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you, in love with you
In love with you, in love with you, with youBaby I, I wanna know
What you think when you're alone

Your last first kissHer name is Noelle
I have a dream about her
She rings my bell
I got gym class in half an hour
Oh how she rocks
In Keds and tube socks
But she doesn't know who I am
And she doesn't give a damn about me
Cause I’m just a teenage dirt bag baby
I'm just a teenage dirt bag baby
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me
Her boyfriend's a dick
And he brings a gun to school
And he'd simply kick
My ass if he knew the truth
He lives on my block
And he drives an Iroc
But he doesn't know who I am
And he doesn't give a damn about me
Cause I'm just a teenage dirt bag baby
I'm just a teenage dirt bag baby
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me
Oh, yeah, dirt bag
No she doesn't know what she's missing
Oh, yeah, dirt bag
No she doesn't know what she's missing
Man I feel like mould
It's prom night and I am lonely
Lo and behold
She's walking over to me
This must be fake
My lip starts to shake
How does she know who I am?
And why does she give a damn about me?
I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden baby
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe
I'm just a teenage dirt bag baby like you
Oh yeah dirt bag
No she doesn't know what she's missing
Oh yeah dirt bag
No she doesn't know what she's missingI know you want, I know you want to take it slow
Think about all the places we could go
If you give in tonight
Just let me set you free
We'll touch the other side
Just give me the key
'Cause we got all night
And we're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way
Why don't you go there with me?
Say the word, say the word but don't say no
Sky dive, you and I with just these clothes
Your secret's safe with me
There's no right time or place
'Cause anyone could see
We'd do it anyway
'Cause we got all night
We're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way
Why don't you go there with me?
Hey, I don't want you to be the one that got away
I want to get addicted to you, yeah
You're rushing through my mind, I wanna feel the high
I wanna be addicted, don't say no, just let go
'Cause we got all night
And we're going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why don't we go there?
Let's take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way
Why don't you go there with me?
With me, with me
Why don't you go there with me?Give you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I look inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane
You could be preoccupied
Different date every night
You've just got to say the word
But you're not into them at all
You just want materials
I should know because I've heard the girls say
I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
And that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you
You've got everything you need
But you want accessories
Got to hold it in your hand
If I changed the world for you
I bet you wouldn't have a clue
Don't you know that I can't stand when girls say
I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
And that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you

I don't have the answer
Don't make me stay the night or ask if I'm alright
I don't have the answer
Heartache doesn't last forever
I'll say I'm fine
Midnight, ain't no time for laughing
When you say goodbye
It makes your lips so kissable
And your kiss unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes, irresistible
I've tried to ask myself, should I see someone else?
I wish I knew the answer
But I know, if I go now, if I leave, then I'm on my own tonight
I'll never know the answer
Midnight doesn't last forever
Dark turns to light
Heartache flips my world around
I'm falling down, down, down, that's why
I find your lips so kissable
And your kiss unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes, irresistible
Irresistible 
Irresistible 
Irresistible

And it's in all the things and other things
That make you who you are and your eyes, irresistible
It makes your lips so kissable 
And your kiss unmissable 
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
IrresistibleWatching you get dressed messes with my head
Take that bag off your shoulder
Come get back in bed, we still got time left
This don't have to be over
And you say it's hard to keep a secret
Girl, don't leave me all alone in this hotel
And these shades can hide us from the streets, yeah
One weekend, I'll promise that I'll never tell
You should probably stay, probably stay, a couple more days
Come on, let me change your ticket home, oh
You should probably stay, be with me, a couple more days
Come on, let me change your ticket home
Don't go, it's not the same when you're gone
And it's not good to be all alone
So you should probably stay, be with me, a couple more days
Come on, let me change your ticket home
Don't play innocent, I know what you meant
When you said you'd come over
Aren't we way past that, playing hard to get?
We did that when we were younger
And you say it's hard to keep a secret
Girl, don't leave me all alone in this hotel
And these shades can hide us from the streets yeah
One weekend I'll promise that I'll never tell
You should probably stay, probably stay, a couple more days
Come on, let me change your ticket home, oh

Girl, I don't wanna say goodbye
You should probably stay, probably stay, a couple more days
Come on, let me change your ticket home, oh
You should probably stay, be with me, a couple more days
Come on, let me change your ticket home

And it's not good to be all alone
Don't go , it's not the same when you're gone
Come on, let me change your ticket homeYeah, ooh, ooh
Can't believe you're packing your bags
Trying so hard not to cry
Had the best time and now it's the worst time
But we have to say goodbye
Don't promise that you're gonna write, don't promise that you'll call
Just promise that you won't forget we had it all
'Cause you were mine for the summer, now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September but I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love
Wish that we could be alone now
If we could find some place to hide
Make the last time just like the first time
Push a button and rewind
Don't say the word that's on your lips, don't look at me that way
Just promise you'll remember when the sky is grey
'Cause you were mine for the summer, now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September but I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love
So please don't make this any harder, we can't take this any farther
And I know there's nothing that I wanna change, change
'Cause you were mine for the summer, now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September but I always will remember
You were my summer love 
You always will be my summer love 
You always will be my summer love
You always will be my summer loveYeah
Uh-huh
One, two, three, three
She sneaks out in the middle of the night, yeah
Tight dress with the top cut low
She's addicted to the feeling of letting go, oh, whoa, let it go
She walks in and the room just lights up
But she don't want anyone to know
That I'm the only one that gets to take her home
Oh-whoa, take her home
But every time I tell her that I want more
She closes the door
She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of falling in love?
She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-falling in love, love
Maybe she's just tryna test me
Wanna see how hard I'm gonna work
Wanna see if I can really tell how much she's worth
And maybe all her friends have told her
"Don't get closer, he'll just break your heart"
But either way she sees in me and it's just so hard 
'Cause every time I tell her how I feel
She says it's not real
One, two, three, four
She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of falling in love?
She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-falling in love, love
What about all the things we say
Talking on the phone so late? 
I can't let her get away from me, oh
When I say that I can't do it no more
She's back in my door
She's not afraid
She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild 
How come she's so afraid of falling in love? 
She's not afraid of scary movies 
She likes the way we kiss in the dark 
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-falling in love, love
She's not afraid
She's not afraidTell me you believe in love
It's not an illusion
I been thinking about the nights and the dangerous tricks
People play on the eyes of the innocent
I can turn a lot of hearts into breaks
With smoke and mirrors disappearing right in front of them
But believe me, I'm not trying to deceive you
I promise falling for me won't be a mistake
No baby, this is not an illusion
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve
Oh baby, this is not an illusion
There's magic between you and me
No baby, this is not an illusion
You really got me lifted on my feet
So tell me you believe in love
'Cause it's not an illusion to me
You don't ever have to worry about me
About how the cards fall, I'm all that you need tonight
I would never turn your heart into broken parts
You don't have to think twice looking in my eyes
Can't you see it? I'm not trying to mislead you
I promise falling for me won't be a mistake
No baby, this is not an illusion
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve
Oh baby, this is not an illusion
There's magic between you and me
No baby, this is not an illusion
You really got me lifted on my feet
So tell me you believe in love
'Cause it's not an illusion to me
You can tie me up in chains, you can throw away the key
But there's no trap doors, I'm not gonna leave
You're the truth I can't explain, you're the only one I see
It's not an illusion to me
No baby, this is not an illusion
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve
Oh baby, this is not an illusion
There's magic between you and me
No baby, this is not an illusion
You really got me lifted on my feet
So tell me you believe in love
'Cause it's not an illusion to me
So tell me you believe in love
'Cause it's not an illusionThe end of the night, we should say goodbye
But we carry on while everyone’s gone
Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more?
As I’m walking towards the door
I’m not sure
But baby if you say you want me to stay, I’ll change my mind
'Cause I don’t wanna know I’m walking away, if you’ll be mine
Won’t go, won’t go, so baby if you say you want me to stay
Stay for the night, I’ll change my mind
Lean in when you laugh, we take photographs
There’s no music on but we dance along
Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more?
As I’m walking towards the door
I’m not sure
But baby if you say you want me to stay, I’ll change my mind
'Cause I don’t wanna know I’m walking away, if you’ll be mine
Won’t go, won’t go, so baby if you say you want me to stay
Stay for the night, I’ll change my mind, I’ll change my mind
Baby if you say you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind
But baby if you say you want me to stay, I’ll change my mind
'Cause I don’t wanna know I’m walking away, if you’ll be mine
Won’t go, won’t go, so baby if you say you want me to stay
Stay for the night, I’ll change my mind, I’ll change my mindGirl, I see it in your eyes, you're disappointed
'Cause I'm the foolish one that you anointed with your heart
I tore it apart
And girl, what a mess I made upon your innocence
And no woman in the world deserves this
But here I am, asking you for one more chance
Can we fall, one more time?
Stop the tape and rewind
Oh, and if you walk away, I know I'll fade
'Cause there is nobody else
It's gotta be you, only you
It's gotta be you, only you
Hey
Now, girl, I hear it in your voice and how it trembles
When you speak to me, I don't resemble who I was
You've almost had enough
And your actions speak louder than words
And you're about to break from all you've heard
But don't be scared, I ain't going nowhere
I'll be here, by your side
No more fears, no more crying
But if you walk away, I know I'll fade
'Cause there is nobody else
It's gotta be you, only you
It's gotta be you, only you
Oh girl, can we try one more, one more time?
One more, one more, can we try?
One more, one more time, I'll make it better
One more, one more, can we try?
One more, one more
Can we try one more time and make it all better?

And I'm always gonna hear your name
There's a right, there's a wrong
And now I see that all along
I messed up, you'll be fine
I'm going to sleep alone tonight
Never gonna be the same, 'cause you're half the world away
A story you'd heard
Now you rest everything on these three words
Now I walk to you 'til my feet hurt
So tell me that's not good enough
And I started drinking
I don't know half of what I'm thinking
I'm deep in, I'm scared I'll stop breathing
We've started to lose who we are

And I'm always gonna hear your name

You tell me you love me
I slept on your doorstep
Begging for one chance
Now that I finally moved on
You say that you missed me all along
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking
You only want me 'cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breaking
You only want me when I'm taken
You're messing with my head
Girl, that's what you do best
Saying there's nothing you won't do
To get me to say yes
You're impossible to resist
But I wouldn't bet your heart on it
It's like I'm finally awake
And you're just a beautiful mistake
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking

Thank you for showing me who you are underneath
No thank you, I don't need another heartless misery

Dizzy’s all it makes us
We know where it takes us, we've been before
Closer, maybe looking closer
There's more to discover
Find out what went wrong without blaming each other
Think that we got more time
When we're falling behind
Got to make up our minds
Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we’ll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes
Wake up, we both need to wake up
Maybe if we face up to this
We can make it through this
Closer, maybe we'll be closer
Stronger than we were before, yeah
Make this something more, yeah
Think that we got more time
When we're falling behind
Got to make up our minds
Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we’ll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes
Yeah, yeah, that's what crazy is
When it's broke and you say there's nothing to fix
And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay
While you're making all the same mistakes
Don't look back but if we don't look back
We’re only learning then
How to make all same mis-, same mistakes again

So we play, play, play all the same old games 
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change

Other guys see it but don’t realise that it's my-my loving
There's something about your laugh that it makes me want to have to
There's nothing funny so we laugh at no-no-nothing
Every minute’s like the last so let’s just take it real slow
Forget about the clock that's tick-tick-ticking

But your words cut like knives
And I'm tired
As you break my heart again this time
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything, but don't you say he’s what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you’re leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and
Tell me a lie
Well, you're the charming type
That little twinkle in your eye
Gets me every time
And well, there must've been a time
I was the reason for that smile
So keep in mind
As you take what's left of you and I

'Cause you stole my heartGirl, that should be me driving to your house
Knocking on your door and kissing you on the mouth
Pulling on your hand, dancing in the dark
'Cause I was the only one who loved you from the start
But now when I see you with him it tears my world apart because
I've been waiting all this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse
Baby, I loved you first
Had my chances
Could have been where he is standing
That's what hurts the most, girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know
Baby, I loved you first
Girl, it should be me calling on your phone
Saying you're the one and that I'll never let you go
I never understood what love was really like
But I felt it for the first time looking in your eyes
But now when I see you with him my whole world falls apart because
I've been waiting all this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse
Baby, I loved you first
Had my chances
Could have been where he is standing
That's what hurts the most, girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know
Baby, I loved you first
First touch, first kiss
First girl who made me feel like this
Heartbreak, it's killing me
I loved you first, why can't you see?
I've been waiting
All this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
Nothing could be worse
Baby, I loved you first
Had my chances
Could have been where he is standing

But now you'll never know
Baby, I loved you first
Baby, I loved you first
Baby, I loved you first, oh, yeah
Baby I loved you firstHey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Ever since you came around
Everybody wanna drag us down
Is it 'cause we look too happy?
I'll never forget when you looked at me
And told me it was all mine
I remember that, like yesterday
It was a summer night on the west side
That was last summer, we had the best times, yeah
We crossed paths like an intersection
Now we both headed in one direction
 & Harry]
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
​Nobody can drag me down​
​Nobody can drag me down
I've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul, and baby you're a boat
Baby you're my only reason
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
Nobody can drag me down

One D let me get some of them fans though
Just a young nigga from Dade County
Where they move chickens like Nando
When I touch down in London town
I be sippin' tea with Simon Cowell
Fact, shout out to Skepta, we shut it down
Y'all lame niggas can't drag me down
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
Nobody can drag me down
Nobody can drag me downI keep playing it inside my head, all that you said to me
I lie awake just to convince myself this wasn't just a dream
'Cause you were right here
And I should've taken the chance
But I got so scared
And I lost the moment again
It's all that I can think about, oh
You're all that I can think about
Is your heart taken?  Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused, just tell me, am I out of time?
Is your heart breaking? How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away when, when I should have kissed you
I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you
I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you
I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you
I should, I should oh, I should have kissed you

When you stood there, just a heartbeat away
When we were dancing and you looked up at me

If I could replay, I would have never let you go
No, oh, never have let you go
Am I out of time?

She was warm she came around
She was dignified
She showed me what it was to cry
You couldn't be that girl I adored
You don't seem to know or seem to care
What your heart is for
But I don't know her anymore
There's nothing left, I used to cry
My conversation has run dry

Nothing's fine, I'm torn

I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight
When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious 
Girl, I hope you’re sure
What you're looking for
‘Cause I'm not good at making promises
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn’t do
Then baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect
So let's start right now
I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can’t live here in the moment
‘Cause I can be the one you love from time to time
When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious

So let's start right now
And if you like cameras flashing every time we go out
And if you're looking for someone to write your breakup songs about
Baby, I'm perfect
Baby, we're perfect
If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn’t do

If I could pretend that I'm asleep
When my tears start to fall
I peek out from behind these walls
I think nobody knows, nobody knows

Nobody likes 
Nobody likes to lose their inner voice 
The one I used to hear before my life made a choice
Baby, oh your secret's safe with me
There's nowhere else in the world that I could ever be
Baby, oh don't it feel like you're all alone
Who's gonna be there when the last angel has flown
And I've lost your way back home
I said nobody knows
Tomorrow I'll be there, my friend
I'll pick up and start all over again

She said it was something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Chasing it tonight
Doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, but she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you ever dreamed of
Is disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of a missing piece of innocence she lost
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you ever dreamed of
Is disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and youHey girl I'm waiting on you

Guess this means you take back all you said before
Like how much you wanted anyone but me
Said you'd never come back but here you are again

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me and honestly
My life  would suck  without you

Maybe I was stupid for telling you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me and honestly
My life  would suck  without youI thought I saw a girl brought to life
She was warm, she came around and she was dignified
She showed me what it was to cry
But you couldn't be that girl I adored
You don't seem to know, seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know her anymore
There's nothing where she used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn
And so I guess the fortune teller's right
Should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
It crawled beneath my veins, and now
I don't care, I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can't touch, I'm torn
'Cause I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
'Cause you're a little late, I'm already torn
There's nothing where he used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
And that's what's going on
Nothing's right, I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already tornLet's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever, forever young?
Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
But sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?
It's hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth is like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever or never?
Forever young
I wanna be forever young, forever
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever or never?
So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams are swinging out of the blue
We let them come true
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever, or never?
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever or never?
Forever young
I wanna be forever young, forever
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever or never?
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever, forever young?I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
They never tried like us
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
'Cause you and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end 
Nothing can come between you and I 
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us 
No, nothing can come between you and I
You and I
Oh, you and I
Oh, you and I
We could make it if we try, you and I
Oh, you and IOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've been roaming around
Always looking down in all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody, yeah
You know that I could use somebody, yeah-yeah-yeah
Someone like you, and all you know, and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover on the streets
You know that I could use somebody, yeah
You know that I could use somebody, yeah-yeah
Someone like you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Off in the night while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
Well I hope it's going to make you notice
Well I hope it's going to make you notice
Someone like me
Someone like me, yeah
Someone like me, somebody, yeah
I'm ready now, I'm ready now

We want the same things
We dream the same dreams
Alright, alright?
I got it all cause she is the one
Her mom calls me love
Her dad calls me son
Alright, alright
I know, I know, I know for sure
Everybody want to steal my girl
Everybody want to take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world

Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na

Kisses like a queen, her walk is so lean
And every jaw drops when she's in those jeans

I don't exist if I don't love her
The sun doesn't shine, the world doesn't turn
Alright, alright?

But when I'm looking at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep making me weak
Yeah, frozen, and can't breathe
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing
Now I'm climbing the walls
But you don't notice at all
That I'm going out of my mind
All day and all night
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to know your name
And I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing

And come on, come into my life

I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thingYou're insecure
So half of four
Your old brains are not what they were before
Add two threes. It's fun for us
Cause we're young and we can still remember stuff
Everyone else can multiply by sixty
Everyone else can add two
Now take off one hundred, and add on 24
Then divide by two and add on seven more
And if you're struggling now it's not hard to tell
You don't know, oh, oh, your math skills are terrible
If only you had a mind like me
You'd understand how to divide the sum by three
And then just add on the age of this OAP
You don't know, oh, oh, your math skills are terrible, oh, oh
It's really kind of pitifulBitch you thought-I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Silence and sound

Nothing can come in betweenLouis and Zayn leave the underground car park as they head to the stadium for the concert:
Minder: Well we got a full chicken.. we can take this to Jamaica, we don’t have anything in Jamaica set up
Unknown male: Are we allowed to talk contraband in this?
Louis: Yes of course. That’s what it’s about... Where’s the lighter? Can anybody pass me a lighter please? I want to light up. You got a lighter?
After much searching, Louis can be seen lighting up and heard coughing
Louis: So here we are, leaving Peru. Joint lit. Happy days... What do you think Zayn? About that kind of content?
Zayn: I think it’s very controversial
Louis sees a police motorbike rider escorting their convoy
Louis: ‘That’s the police. That’s the po po... Nice. I’m trying to blow it into the camera. Smokescreen baby!... That’s just Zayn warming up there before the show. Zayn takes his job very seriously. He makes sure he goes through a two-hour intense warm up regime before every show, just to get himself in the zone. One very, very important factor to Zayn’s warm up, of course is Mary Jane herself. In fact I’m presenting it to him now for some fantastic singing
Louis passes Zayn the roll up cigarette
Louis: How is it Zayn?
Zayn: Nice
Louis: That’s the po po. One nil
Louis starts filming out the window
Louis: Get a bit of the culture. How’s that kind of culture?
Zayn: It’s great culture this. It’s going to be even greater culture when we get to Jamaica
Member of crew: I just got an update. We got chicken in Chile
Zayn: Chicken in Chile! Chile chicken
Louis: Yeh baby. That’s the po po. Two nil
Louis puts on an exaggerated dopey voice and sways the camera around:
Louis: Fucking ‘ell bro, I’m chillin. Oh my God bro. My ‘ed’s a wreck
Louis: It’s green only! Nig!
Louis: I’m just wondering now. I’m sitting here in Peru wondering will this come back to me? Who knows? Maybe, maybe not
Another police bike passes:
Louis: One nil bitch! Look at this bitch... He’s having a look. He’s thinking. I’m sure I can smell an illegal substance in there. And he’s hit the nail on the head
Zayn: Carl showed... me Kid Rock’s last book. And it’s about twice the size. Hard back. Black. Simple writing. No bullshit.No like ‘My favourite colour’s blue.. And all just sick pictures
Louis is passed the roll up by a crew member and zooms in on it:
Louis: Ooo Stubbsy!
Zayn: “Every time you look in it you just think 'fuck I’ve never seen that picture.' That’s a bad photo...instead of boring crap.
Louis: “Yeah I know, same old crap that I’m sure the fans are bored of reading.”
Zayn: "They want to know what we're up to now man."
Talking about the Kid Rock book Zayn says: “He’s smoking a J in one of the pictures Louis and he’s got a gold ring on his middle finger, which is a bid weird, but, aside from that he’s sticking his middle finger up with a J in his mouth, and that's one of the pictures in the book.
Louis: “Sick.”Ooh
Maybe it's the way she walked 
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards 
Just like she already owned it
I said, "Can you give it back to me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it went oh, oh, oh

I think it went oh, oh, oh

Ooh
Said her name was Georgia Rose 
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth 
But she kissed me like she meant it
I said, "Can I take you home with me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever 
I think it went oh, oh, oh

And live while we’re youngToday was going to be the day
That they're going to throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you got to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Backbeat the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how 
Because maybe
You're going to be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonder wall
Today was going to be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you got to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now 
I said maybe 
You're going to be the one that saves me 
And after all 
You're my wonder wall It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that
I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss for you
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
Well the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
 & Liam]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that
I put down in words
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words 
How wonderful life is while you're in the worldShut the door, turn the light off
I wanna be with you, I wanna feel your love
I wanna lay beside you
I cannot hide this, even though I try
Heartbeats harder, time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face
If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I’ll find the words to say before you leave me today
Close the door, throw the key
Don't wanna be reminded, don't wanna be seen
Don’t wanna be without you
My judgement's clouded like tonight's sky
Hands are silent, voice is numb
Try to scream out, my lungs
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face
If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me today
Flashing lights in my mind, going back to the time
Playing games in the street, kicking balls at my feet
There's a numb in my toes, standing close to the edge
There's a pile of my clothes at the end of your bed
As I feel myself fall, make a joke of it all
You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I’ll find the words to say before you leave me today
You know I’ll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me todayI gotta feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
I gotta feeling 
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
I gotta feeling 
Oh yeah
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh oh oh
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Sing along to my stereo
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note
Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water 
And I, think of all the things
What you're doing
And through my head I make a picture 
'Cause since I've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why won't you come on over
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie, Valerie
Won't you come on over, Valerie?
I thought I saw a girl brought to life
She was warm, she came around like she was dignified
She showed what it was to cry
You couldn't be that girl I adored
You don't seem to know, don't seem to care
What your heart is for?
Well, I don't know her anymore
There's nothing left I used to cry
My inspiration has run dry
Nothing's fine I'm torn
I'm all out of faith and this is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn 
TornGive you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I looked inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane
You could be preoccupied, different date every night
You just got to say the word
That you're not into them at all, you just want materials
I should know because I've heard when girls say
I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
And that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you
You've got everything you need, but you want accessories
Got to hold it in your hand
If I changed the world for you, I bet you wouldn't have a clue
Don't you know that I can't stand when girls say
I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
And that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you
Oh and all the girls say
I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
And that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you
Be loved by you, I want it, I'll stay true
I wonder if you knew what you put me through
Would you want, you want, you want me to love you too
I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want but that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you
]
Oh, and all the girls say
I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
And that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you 
I want, I want, I want
And all the girls say
I want, I want, I want
And that's crazy
I want, I want, I want to be loved by youGirl I see it in your eyes you're disappointed
'Cause I'm the foolish one that anointed wih your heart
I tore it apart
And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence
And no woman in the world deserves this
But here I am asking you for one more chance
Can we fall, one more time?
Stop the tape and rewind
Oh and if you walk away I know I'll fade
'Cause there is nobody else
It's gotta be you, only you
It's gotta be you, only you
It's gotta be you, only you
Now girl I hear it in your voice and how it trembles
When you speak to me I don't resemble, who I was
You've almost had enough
And your actions speak louder than words
And you're about to break from all you've heard
Don't be scared, I ain't going nowhere
I'll be here, by your side
No more fears, no more crying
But if you walk away, I know I'll fade
Cause there is nobody else
It's gotta be you, only you

Maybe it's the way she walked
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards
Just like she already owned it
I said, "Can you give it back to me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Said her name was Georgia Rose
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth
But she kissed me like she meant it
I said, "Can I take you home with me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh

It was the best song everHey everyone. Saw some signs about me tonight that where a bit upsetting dont know whats happend but i hope I'm good with you guys and I hope you know how grateful I am that you guys have done all of this for us because i genuinely can't believe how lucky I am to be here.
It's amazing that you guys have created all this for us, non of us can believe the stuff that we get to do everyday and it's all down to you guys spending time on here spreading the word about us and being so dedicated spending all your money trying to make it to our shows an stuff.
'Thanks to everyone that has been so far every crowd has litterally been amazing and it's so tough to pick a favourite.'
'Like I said I hope everything’s ok and I know a lot of people may not like me right now and feel a little under appreciated as we dont get to come out and meet u guys all that much i wish it was easier.
'I do truly appreciate you guys tho you have changed my life and i could never thank you enough I hope in time it will all be cool.'You don't understand, you don't understand
What you do to me when you hold his hand
We were meant to be but a twist of fate
Made it so you had to walk away
'Cause we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now
Yeah we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now
One, two three!
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one
Who'll hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so come on
Baby be with me so happily
It's 4 a.m. and I know that you're with him
I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin
And if he feels my traces in your hair
I'm sorry, love, but I don't really care
'Cause we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now
Yeah we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now
One, two, three!
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one
Who holds you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so come on
Baby be with me so happily
So happily
One, two, three, four!
Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh
We're on fire now
So happily
Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh
We're on fire now
We're on fire
Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh
We're on fire now
I don't care, yay
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one
Who holds you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
Yeah, yeah!
I know you wanna leave so come on
Baby be with me so happily
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one
Who holds you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so come on
Baby be with me so happilyDown to Earth
Keep on falling when I know it hurts
Going faster than a million miles an hour
Tryna catch my breath some way, somehow
Down to Earth
It's like I'm frozen, but the world still turns
Stuck in motion, and the wheels keep spinning 'round
Moving in reverse with no way out
And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you
How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I've never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Oh, infinity, oh, infinity
Infinity
Eyes can't shine
Unless there's something burning bright behind
Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine
I feel myself running out of time
And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you
How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I've never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity 
Oh, infinity 
Yeah, infinity 
How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay 
I've never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity]
There was a time
I was everything and nothing all in one
When you found me
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun 
]
And I need to tell you
That you light up every second of the day 
But in the moonlight
You just shine like a beacon on the bay
And I can't explain
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feeling I get about you, deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight, yeah
Girl, you take my breath away
The way you look tonightI figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
They never tried like us
You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
'Cause you and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end 
Nothing can come between you and I 
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us 
No, nothing can come between you and I
You and I
Oh, you and I
Oh, you and I
We could make it if we try, you and I
Oh, you and IEvery...
She's been my queen since we were sixteen
We want the same things, we dream the same dreams, alright, alright
I got it all 'cause she is the one
Her mum calls me love, her dad calls me son, alright, alright
I know, I know, I know for sure
Kisses like cream, her walk is so mean
And every jaw drops when she's in those jeans, alright, alright
I don't exist, if I don't have her
The sun doesn't shine, the world doesn't turn, alright, alright
But I know, I know, I know for sure
She know, she knows
That I never let her down before
Oh, she know, she knows
That I'm never gonna let another take her love from me now
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
She belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one cause she belong to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one cause she belong to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one cause she belongs to me
Oh yeah, alright yeah

But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know-oh-oh
You don't know you’re beautiful
If only you saw what I see what I can see
You’ll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm lookin’ at you and I can't believe
You don't know-oh-oh
You don't know you’re beautiful-oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Camden Roundhouse! Make some noise!
So c-c'mon
You got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a so-o-ong
I don't know why, you're vein' why
And turn away when I look into your eye-eye-eyes
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

And I think of all the things what you're doing?
And in my head I paint a picture!
Well since you've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me!
So why don't you come on over, Valerie!
Valerie! 
Why don't you come on over, ValerieI figured it out
Seconds and hours
I know how it goes
Silence and sound
Tight like us
You and I
We can make it 'til the end
You and I
Can separate the two of us
You and I
I figured it out
Meet in the middle
I see what it's like
Never together
Like us
You and I
We can make it 'til the end
You and I
Can separate the two of us
'Cause you and I
We don't wanna be like them
Nothing can come between you and I
Can separate the two of us 
You and I
Oh, you and I
We could make it if we try, you and I
