Polaroid of you dancing in my room
I want to remember
I think it was about noon
It's getting harder to understand, to understand
How you felt in my hands 
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
And I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me to
And I could be a pretty girl
Won't ever make you blue
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you
I was so blinded by you, now I cry
Just thinking 'bout the fool that I was
I was such a fool
I'm alone now but it's better for me
I don't need all your negativity
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
And I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me to
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll never make you blue
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in youTu-tu-ru-tu-tu
Tu-ru-tu-tu-tu
Tu-tu-ru-tu-tu
Tu-ru-tu-tu-tu
Tu-tu-ru-tu-tu
Tu-ru-tu-tu-tu
Sometimes I feel like I just wanna go back to my old ways
You're telling me I'm silly
It's no fun in the old days
I'm such a romantic
I never remember how things really happen
I guess you're attractive
Or something
Live in the moment
That's what they tell me
But what ever happened
To when you would hold me
And hold me
And hold me
Girlfriend or girl, that's a friend?
It's easy just to pretend
That we don't have something real
It's just how we feel
We feel
Oh, it's just how we feel
How we feel
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I wanna be the one you think about at night
And I wanna be the one that you would put up a fight for
You know that I adore
That even when you're bored
I'd buy you anything and everything I can't affordSorry I didn't kiss you
But it's obvious I wanted to
Bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse
But my luck couldn't get any worse
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto Bismol veins and I grin
You look so nice in your shirt
It's sad because it just hurts
I'd do anything for you
But would you do that for me, too?
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto Bismol veins and I grinAha, ayy, aha
Man, come on, man, don't leave, fuck
What the fuck? Why you leave me on read?
I don't like this, fuck, ahh
If I told you what I'm thinkin' 'bout
It's hard to say to you, but
I just know that I need some time alone
It's all I think about at night
I need some time away from you
Can't even be in the same room
I think I'm going crazy
Been home and lonely lately
What do you think about me?
Can you fight or will you flee?
Call me, you got my number
Don't let me go yet, lover
You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone
You know that I know
That you're not comin' home
These days, I’m lost, you left me to drown
To drown
Perdido en mi mente y buscando paraíso
But I can not find that si no estás aquí conmigo
Don't know what you're doin' and I don't know who you with
En ruinas, reina, siento yo que me quedé
Con mis esperanzas falsas, casi siento que me matan
Regresa conmigo, amor, where did we go?
I need some time away from you
Can't even be in the same room
I think I'm going crazy
Been home and lonely lately
What do you think about me?
Can you fight or will you flee?
Call me, you got my number
Don't let me go yet, lover
You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone
You know, that I know
That you're not comin' home
These days, I’m lost, you left me to drown
To drown
Stuck inside my mind, I think I’ve lost it all
Free me from my thoughts, I think I've fallen off
Memories don't return, they seem to run away
Dreamin' of a world where I would wanna stay
You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone
You know, that I know
That you're not coming home
These days, I’m lost, you left me to drown
To drownSome things just aren't that simple
You called me wondering why I changed
Or why I don't look the same
Why I think so differently now
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on?
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on? Count on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
Some things just never seem to fade
I'm thinking about how we were on our first date
You understood the words I was saying
I knew I'd never let you get away
Hold you tight, squeeze you right, tell you what I want
Put me in your bedroom and I'll sing a little song
Hold you tight, squeeze you right, give you all I've got
See you in the morning, over coffee, we'll talk, oh
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on?
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on? Count on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-onEvery second counts
I don't wanna talk to you anymore, and
All these little games
You can call me by the name I gave you yesterday, yeah
Every minute counts
I don't wanna watch TV anymore, yeah
Can you figure me out?
Just doin' this to waste more time on the couch
Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time
I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
Can you see me using everything to hold back?
I guess this could be worse
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Pour your glass of wine
Mitchell told me I should be just fine 
Cases under the bed
Spill it open, let it rush to my head
I don't wanna be forward, I don't wanna cut corners
Savor this with everything I have inside of me
I'm not the type to run
I know that we're having fun
But what's the rush? Kissing, then my cheeks are so flushed
Tell you how I felt
Sugar coated melting in your mouth
Pardon my emotions
I should probably keep it all to myself
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time
I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
Can you see me using everything to hold back?
I guess this could be worse
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bagsHello?
Are you into me, like I'm into you?
Do you wanna do the things I wanna do with you?
You're so close, and yet so far
I wonder how you look when you're in the dark
You're just one click away, click away, click away
From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake
You're just one click away, click away, click away
From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake
Played you DOOM, man, you play Drake
You left crumbs all on my face
Taste like RiRi, taste like Bey
Bought you Fenty, took his place
Rolled your weed and kissed your face
Man, wanna smoke you out like all-day
Man, wanna do a quickie in the hallway, can
You be all down for the boy, no mass
Hot jump, skip rope, twenty-three years old
Made a hundred grand and went broke, I'm an asshole
Clairo, will you be my real or my fake though?
Pesos, cashing out checks when I say so
Frame my life and take my soul
Make me crazy, make me old
Save me roses, text my phone
Fake like rappers, fake like jokes
I know
You're just one click away, click away, click away
From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake
You're just one click away, click away, click away
From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fakeIn Massachusetts
Only 30 minutes from Alewife
I lay in my room
Wonderin' why I've got this life
I met you by surprise
You were hangin' out all the time
But you know you saved me from doin'
Something to myself that night
You called me seven times
One, two, three, four, on the line
I didn't mean to scare you
Just had the thoughts in my mind
They showed up to my door
My parents didn't know what for
Swear I could've done it
If you weren't there when I hit the floor
It's been so long
And you've been my sister all along
But you know I'll be alright
Eighth grade was never that tightI think we could do it if we tried
If only to say you're mine
Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime
I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime
You know I'll do anything you ask me to
But, oh my God, I think I'm in love with you
Standing here alone now
Think that we can drive around
I just wanna say
How I love you with your hair down
Baby, you don't gotta fight
I'll be here 'til the end of time
Wishing that you were mine
Pull you in, it's alright
I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime
Honey, I don't want it to fade
There's things that I know could get in the way
I don't want to say goodbye
And I think that we could do it if we tried
I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime
I think we could do it if we tried
(I think we could, I think we could do it
We could, we could, do it)
I think we could do it if we tried
(Sofia, know that you, you, you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime)
I think we could do it if we tried
(Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime)
I think we could do it if we tried
(Sofia, know that you, you, you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime)
I think we could do it if we triedIs it alright to feel this way so early?
And in my blood, all the sweet nothings fallin' in love overnight
Didn't mean to get so close
And I know that I should probably go
But I got this feeling
Tell me, girl, I gotta know
Touch you softly, I call you up late at night
Know that it isn't right, but you could be my one and only
You get me in the mood, know what I'm tryna do
Do you think that we can move closer, baby?
I want you, yeah, yeah
All my life, been wanting this forever 
And in my mind, think of ways to ask you
"Why don't you come over sometime?"
Didn't mean to get so close
And I know that I should probably go
But I got this feeling
Tell me, girl, I gotta know
Touch you softly, I call you up late at night
Know that it isn't right, but you could be my one and only
You get me in the mood, know what I'm tryna do 
Do you think that we can move closer, baby?
I want you, yeah, yeah
And I don't care what they say
And I don't care what they say
Care what they say to me, I'm doing it differently
Baby, I'm doing it differentlyHow are you feeling? How are you doing?
I'm sorry, I just wanted to hear your voice so clear
What are you thinking? Am I amusing?
It's so strange to talk after all these years
What is the meaning? It's so confusing
All my old feelings coming back to me
When was the last time that I saw your face?
Know it like the back of my hand, I'd say
And you're not that dumb anymore
I picked up the books you threw to the floor
Put them back on the shelf
Don't you see how much I want your help?
And I know we're not the same as we were
Used to be falling hard, but now it just hurts me so bad
And you know that I can't hold back
All of these worries that I have had 'bout you
And I know that it's time
To forget how I'm feeling, don't want to give in
But I know, know that it's right
To listen to my breathing and start believing myself
And I know that it's time
To forget how I'm feeling, don't want to give in
But I know, know that it's right
To listen to my breathing and start believing myself
Woah, myself, myself
And I know we're not the same as we were
Used to be falling hard, but now it just hurts me so bad
And you know that I can't hold back
All of these worries that I have had 'bout youI wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Switchblade 'round my neck, don't get close to me
Ask about your life, still in the nose-bleeds?
Laying in your bed, call it intimacy
Wish I could get past the security
Wonder why I wake up living in a made-up
Dream of you and I, together there
Baby, wake the fuck up, time for you to grow up
Don't you know that life is rarely ever fair?
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Tell you how I feel, I keep it real clean
Lock hanging 'round my neck, you don't get a key
Come a little closer, I'll show you what I mean
Oh, boy, no, it's all for me
Ice cold, baby, I'm ice cold
You're the only one who could make me thaw
Ice cold, baby, I'm ice cold
You're the only one who could make me thaw
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you, baby
I wouldn't ask you, baby
To be the one I love
To be the one I love, I love
We could be
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
Caught me by surprise
Everything I need in my life
I wanna call you mine
I wanna be intertwined
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
Feels like I've known you for so long
Without you, I don't feel strong
Feels like I've known you for so long
Without you, I don't feel so strong, yeah
So strong
We could be so strongI feel it in my bones, even when I'm alone
Mama said, "I told you so," going down a different road
You call me late at night, I pick up every time
Wish that I could rewind, get some peace of mind
Shut up, don't wanna hear it now, I'm fed up
Wish I could say it was enough, oh, to make me walk away
And I'm messed up 'cause every time I start to get up
And now my head feels fucked up, and I know it won't change
The things you do
Only make me want to get closer to you
And the things that you say
Only make me want to stay
Can't push me away, I'm not going, I'll wait
You know this street runs two ways, say
So I need to hear your voice
Know I'm standing here by choice
And I can't hear the background noise, anyway
Shut up, don't wanna hear it now, I'm fed up
Wish I could say it was enough, oh, to make me walk away
And I'm messed up 'cause every time I start to get up
And now my head feels fucked up, and I know it won't change
The things you do
Only make me want to get closer to you
And the things that you say
Only make me want to stayI'm nervous, couldn’t tell you why
Touching me, hands warm on my thighs
And I know I could turn a blind eye
Afraid of what I'm gonna find
Does it really have to be this way?
Oh, and my body hasn't felt the same
Since you left my apartment
Think my pillows still have your scent
I just want to let you know
I’m seeing the sides that you don't show
And I know that we've got some potential
'Cause that look you gave me was so gentle
Do you think that you could stay?
I need more time, I need to get away from here
Pour my love out
Spill it all on the ground
Is it all in my head? What are you saying?
Usually I'd be fine, but my head is spinning
I never let anybody in
Somehow you got under my skin
Never seen a face like yours
I got it together, but my breath feels short
I don't wanna close the door
Maybe I should just go up north
All I'm tryna say
Is I miss you in every way
Fingertips on my back
Things I know that I can't have
Never seen a face like yours
I got it together, but my breath feels short
I don’t wanna close the door
Maybe I should just go up north
Maybe I should just go up north
Maybe I should just go up northPiecing it all back together again
Didn't get along, been four years since
We had it all, and you were my friend
Those days got away, hope you find solace in this
I was 15 when I first felt loneliness
Cut my hair, only listened to Loveless
Grown apart and we're so far gone
But I'm waving the white flag
Sending my love back, move on
Laughing at me, you kick me when I'm down
Oh, how can you pretend you didn't say that now?
Wish you the best, I know that you're stressed out
But you know in small towns
What goes around comes back around, mmmTravelled so far on my own
I don't know where I've gone
And I don't wanna be alone
When I am so far from my home
You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you
Wanna go back to the place where we started
At the party, I see you, but you keep your guard up
We could be something special if you wanted
I'm afraid that if we tried to, you would just give up
You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you
You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you
Do you wanna go away with me?
Do you wanna go away with me?
Do you wanna go away with me?
Do you wanna go away with me?
You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you
You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over youAlone, for the last time
You're just a loner
Give it a try
And you're hard on yourself
And your laugh, it just melts in my hands
Lonesome in the street
You say the mice all seem to laugh at me
I'll get by with you on my mind
I'll get by with you on my side
I'll get by with you on my mind
I'll get by with you on my side
I'm not at home 
And I'll just say that
Being with you makes me feel less old
A kid on the street playing basketball
Horses will run forever, can't be called
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
Wish that I, wish that I
Wish that I could go back in time
I'll get by with you on my mind 
I'll get by with you on my side 
I'll get by with you on my mind 
I'll get by with you on my sideEvery night
Think of things I can't do or haven't done
And does it make me weak?
Sometimes I feel like I can't breathe
Is that all you see in me?
Don't you wait for something more
I'll still be sinking to the floor
Oh, you can't help me
Now I'm all alone
Is it my doing? Is it my doing? Mmm
Outside, it's getting colder
Why does it feel like I'm older than I asked to be?
But when you say my name
It all falls away so tenderly
Don't you wait for something more
I'll still be sinking to the floor
Oh, you tried to help me
Why do I feel so cold?
Is it my doing? Is it my doing?
Is it my doing? Is it my doing? 
Is it my doing? Oh 
Mmm, is it my doing? 
MmmIs it a crime that I'm just trying to hold you?
To hold you?
Interlocking fingers and I'm ready, I told you
I told you
If I'm in love then why is my heart hurting?
Hurting?
Everywhere that I go
I just see you, I see you
I wrote it down
I told my mom
My friends all know
We get along
I want you
To want me too
I want to kiss you
I want to love you
I want to touch you
I think too much
YouHow did I try to get you off my mind?
How did I try to get you off my mind?
Could this be the end
Of you and I for now?
Hope that I see you soon
Don't know what I would do
My heart is under the weather
I know that I’m the only one who can heal it
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I try to be the strong one for you
But that's just too hard for anyone to do
Ooh
MmmStop, wait a minute
Tell me what you're thinking
Baby, I don’t know you so well
I'll put my heart in it 
Hold me for a minute 
Baby, I would never lie to you 
Hold me close, tell me why
Put me in your bed at night
I wanna stay here forever
Hold me close, but don't you lie
Put me in your dreams at night
I shouldn't tell you this
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreams
Somedays I try to call
You never seem to fall for me at all
Baby, why you so cold?
I'm standing at your door
Don't understand why you ignore my love
It is so warm for you
And you're the boy of my dreams
It's not so hard to see why you're the one for me
I love you so dearly
You're the boy of my dreams
It's not so hard to see why you're the one for me
I love you so dearly
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy, you're the boy
You're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreamsRemember when we used to fight?
I'd  stay up all night
Trying  to put it behind me
But was it really that long ago?
Realized that I should let it go
Don't  even know what time it was
Call  me when you get a second
Know it's been a minute since I've picked you up
We  drove around so I opened the windows down
Don't ask any questions
Only been here for three seconds
The party's ending, where's your friend?
But  I don't think I can do this again
I don't think I can do this again
I don't think I can do this again
But I don't think I can do this again
I don't think I can do this again
The grass is always green, but why did it used to feel
So much softer, longer, sweeter, cleaner than this?
And I'm all in my head now
Don't you see what you've done now?
Missing all the things I wouldn't have loved
Call me when you get a second
Know it's been a while since we've talked it out
We're missing out
So young and we're so full of doubt
And I've been thinking of you in my room
Do you remember it, too?
Remember it, too?
Remember it, too?
I don't think I can do this again
I don't think I can do this again
I don't think I can do this again
I don't think I can do this again
And I've been thinking of you in my room
Do you remember it, too?
Remember it, too?Feelings are so fragile
Egos are always blown
A ship in a bottle
Collapses under my cell phone
Your soft skin, unbroken sin
Next to my rough calluses
A mild kiss, sleep paralysis
Tell me more about your sister
Brittle bones
Hold my body together
Tender touches
Mend me with feathersI know there's something right
Right in between us
I see you standing there
Want you to just trust
You make it hard for me
So hard not to stare
I'm moving closer baby
Why don't you seem to care?
All my life, thinking about all these times
Wanted someone like you
Hold me tight, but treat me right
All my life, needing someone to get by
What if I had it right from the very first time?
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better for you
I know it isn't right
You creep into the night
Maybe you want a friend
Maybe not in this life
Why is it so hard, hard to please you
All I wanted was you in my room
All my life, thinking about other guys
Never hit me like this
Cut me deep like a knife
All my life, tried so hard to be alright
What have you done to me
Blinded, I lost my mind
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better for you
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better for you
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better for youWhenever I called you, I couldn't say
(How you want it baby? In the front, in the back
How you want it baby? In the front, in the back
How you want it baby? In the front, in the back)
It was only yesterday
But yesterday's so far away
(In the front, in the back
How you want it baby? In the front, in the back
How you want it baby? In the front, in the back)
What's the ETA?
(How you want it baby? In the front, in the back
How you want it baby? In the front, in the back)
Feeling a lot, feeling alone
Got to remember that I don’t need no-one else
Just me and myself
I drift to you, put me back on the shelf
I’m thinking of you
And it's driving me through
The walls in my head but I’m so upset
Can’t do nothing 'bout it, collapse on the bed
I don't wanna be someone else's
Someone else's someone else
I don't wanna be someone else's
Someone else's someone else
Call up your phone
I just get the tone
I guess that you're not home
Trying not to be a nuisance
But I call up your phone
I just get the tone
I guess that you're not home
You seem to be going out a lot lately
And you don’t have time for me, baby
It's alright
I'll be going out a lot more lately
And I won’t have time for you, baby
I’m sorry, I'm sorry

I don't like this, fuck
Ahh
If I told you what I'm thinking 'bout
It's hard to say to you but
I just know that I need some time alone
It's all I think about at night
I need some time away from you
Can't even be in the same room
I think I'm going crazy
Been home and lonely lately
What do you think about me
Can you fight or will you flee
Call me, you got my number
Don't let me go yet lover
You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone
You know, that I know
That you're not coming home
These days, I’m lost, you left me to drown, to drown
Perdido en mi mente y buscando paraíso
But I can not find that si no estas aquí conmigo
Don't know what you're doing and I don't know who you with
En ruinas reina, sin tu yo aquí me quede
Con mis esperanzas falsas, casi siento que me matan
Regresa conmigo
Amor where did we go
I need some time away from you
Can't even be in the same room
I think I'm going crazy
Been home and lonely lately
What do you think about me
Can you fight or will you flee
Call me, you got my number
Don't let me go yet lover
You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone
You know, that I know
That you're not coming home
These days, I’m lost, you left me to drown, to drown
Stuck inside my mind I think I’ve lost it all
Free me from my thoughts, I think I've fallen off
Memories don't return, they seem to melt away
Dreaming of a world where I would wanna stay
You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone
You know, that I know
That you're not coming home
These days, I’m lost, you left me to drown, to drownLove, love, love, love
Love, love, love
Done with these fellas
I don't love these fellas
We dust off these fellas
Do it for fun
Don't take it personal
Personally, I'm surprised you called me after the things I said
Skrt skrt on fellas
Skrt up on fellas
Skrt down, you acting like me
Acting like we wasn't more than a summer fling
I said farewell and you took it well
I promise I won't cry over spilled milk
Gimme a paper towel, gimme another Valium
Gimme another hour or two, hour with you
Why you bother me when you know you don't want me?
Why you bother me when you know you got a woman?
Why you hitting me when you know you know better?
Know you know better
Know your crew better than you do when
Call me looking for you
I been looking for you
Got me looking forward to weekends
With you baby, with you baby
With you baby
With you, woah
We do whatever we want, go wherever we want
Love however we want, it don't matter
You'll do whatever I want, get whatever I want
Do whatever I need, it's about
Love, 'long as we got
Love, love, love
Should've never gave you my number, I did it with you
Should've never let you hit it, I split it with you
I regret it, you gots the fetish
You gots the problem, now it's a problem, oh, no
Skrrr, skrrr on bitches 
I don't know these bitches 
Dig dirt on bitches, do it for fun
Don't take it personal, baby
Love on my ladies, love to my ladies
Dated a few
Dated a few
Dated a fewI was in love for the second time
She told me not to lie
You said, honey, I can sense that you're
Struggling to find out what happened to you
On tour and alone with nothing to lose
Cried myself to sleep that night
I haven't wrapped my head around it
Maybe I should think about
Your hands on my sides, my shirt lost to wine
When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me"
When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me better than the rest"
When I turnеd around and said
"I can't believe you likе me better than the rest"
Turns out kissing someone older
Doesn't mean there's gonna be a lesson attached
Say, I'm mature for my age
But there's a bed to be made, why don't you lie in it?
Swear I'll take this one to my grave
And nothing's gonna change
Oh man, it is the same
There's a child writing stories of when they become king
And learn to take everything
When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me better than the rest"
When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me better than the rest"
Oh, better than the restHow did I try
To get you off my mind
How did I try
To get you off my mind
Could this be the end
Of you and I for now
Hope that I see you soon
Don't know what I would do
My heart is under the weather
I know that I’m the only one who can heal it
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I try to be the strong one
For you
But that’s just too hard for anyone to do
Ooh, ohI just landed in another atmosphere
I'm just floating, in a stain steel sphere
I bet you have questions like, "Where did I come from?"
I know,I come from that planet that hit Tiamat
Years ago
Years ago
Years ago
Years ago
I do my flows and then I get so lost
Light just take my spheres to go
Spheres to go
Spheres to go
Spheres to go
To the top of the pyramid, let's save the world like this
Conversing with light bodies 
But really they all a part of me
Let's get the whip and go
'Cause I'm tired of this solar ring
Whatever 
Whatever I do
Whatever
I don't care, get dressed whatever
I don't feel like talking, whatever
Cause it's really out of my control
How you feel is not my problem
I really don't want you to go, but I do not want to stop you
I do not want to stop you
I do not want to stop you
I do not want to stop you
I do not want you to stop you
I don't want to stop youSweet Jane
A lock of my hair
A bookmark in your head, I'm just another person
Polaroid in your fragile hands
Tear the picture of us apart back together
They're all mine
Pictures I took of you
I tend to put them on my windowsill
I want you to care for me
Don't you know I'm feeling blue?
Just another unreciprocated thing that I doMaybe you know that it's been too long
Going through the motions as you sing your song
Doesn't matter who you are or what you've done
Still got to wake up and be someone
I don't care what the papers say
It's just another intern with a resume
I'm gonna fall in love with you someday
I'm gonna fall in love and runaway
I'm gonna fall in love and runaway
Everyone I know has got their own ideal
I just want to be in love and fake something real
Doesn't matter who you are or what you do
Something in the world will make a fool of you
Something in the world will make a fool of you
Pick up the phone and I swear it's the last time
Pick up the phone and I swear it's the last time
Falling in love and I swear it's the last time
Falling in love and I swear it's the last time
TimeI waited for so long for a guy like you
This guy who likes me too, and I think I like you maybe
I know that you're so unavailable
But you call me all the time, and you know I've got you on my mind
We look good in pink and blue
You love me, maybe it's true
You say, "Baby, how are you?"
I'm okay, how about you?
I'm waiting for you to make up your mind
If you take me for a ride, do you think I'll be your girlfriend?
I don't wanna wake up and still feel like I'm dreaming
All I wanna do is tell the world how I'm feeling
You know it's true
Both me and you
Hey, why don't you hit me up?
I know you've got time, so come and pick me up
You know you want to hang, why don't you hit me up?
I know you've got time, so come and pick me up
You know you want to hang, why don't you hit me up?
I know you've got time, so come and pick me up
You know you want to hang, why don't you hit me up?
I know you've got time
We look good in pink and blue
You love me, maybe it's true
You say, "Baby, how are you?"
I'm okay, how about you?
We look good in pink and blue
You love me, maybe it's true
You say, "Baby, how are you?"
I'm okay, how about you?My funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
But don't change your hair for me
No, no no no
Not if you care for me
Stay little Valentine, stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Each day is Valentine's Day
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
But don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little Valentine
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Each day is Valentine's DayMeet me a thousand years ago
A message written on your face, you watch the boys
Play soccer after school
And you swear they all look like tools
But I guess it's over now
You're not here and I'm not around
We'd watch tv and see the people 'cross the street
We like the time
Even though we're both hiding frowns
In seventh grade
Seventh grade
Seventh grade
I'll never kiss him
You already killed me, 
What was it like?
To be a lie
To be a lie
To be a lie
To be a lie
To be a lie
K-I-S-S, I-N-G
Sitting in the tree
Do you want me, like I do?
Like I do?
Like I do?I wanna see you
But I can't
I wanna hold your hand
Maybe I didn't try
Maybe you just wanna see me cry
I wanna see you
But I can't
I wanna hold your hand
Maybe I didn't try
Maybe you just wanna see me cry
Maybe you just wanna see me cry
You just wanna see me cry
You just wanna see me cry
I wanna see you
But I can't
I wanna hold your hand...Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
I don't wanna feel alone anymore
But you're probably tired again
Ooh
OohSpend all my time
Wondering why I hurt
Spend all my months
Trying to decipher
Your words
But you have to come to terms with it
And I think I'll be alright
If you just give me your word
Another day, a cold break
I hear you laughing at me
The harmony of our souls
Is something that
Is left with me
But you have to come to terms with it
And I think I'll be alright if
I hear you say you're sorryGot out of the lake
It swallowed me
So you're standing by the tree
I can feel a sensation
Of the things that keep me on my knees
Do I impress with intelligence
Would that make me more elegant
My skin isn't porcelain
Not the best sense of etiquette
Count my fingers not the thumbs
Eight reasons why you're the one
Its easy to see that my worrying doesn't keep me from hurtingYou'll find there's never really time for babes and wine
You lie, you'll never really change
And say bye, bye
You should turn back now
You're only crying just because
There's no return now
And all this lying has to stop
I'll never coincide if the chemistry is right
Oh babe do you see the light of day
I like to watch you run
But I'll never touch your bum
Oh babe do you see the light of day
You should turn back now
You only crying just because
There is no return now
And all this lying has to stop
Lying has to stop
Lying has to stop
If I told you
Lying has to stop
You know it
All this lying has to stopMama's got the velvet touch
She never seems to make a fuss
Louie tells me I'm okay
I don't need that boy anyway
Maybe our signs will align
I'm a Leo, a Leo, a Leo, and I never know what I want
Aquarius boy
You were mean to meYou're the blood rushing through my head
Once blue and now is shades of red
Read all my secret forms
Ingesting my chloroform
Warmer than my body
You breathe strong and wholly
I’ve got holes in me
Corridors
Lead to nothing more
Than the dead ends
On my twin bed
You’re soft and gentle
Your touch helps me melt
My stone-cold heart
Given me a spare part
Didn’t leave me in the dark
If I could kiss you one last time
I'd tell you what I'd find
I spy with my eye
A grown body
Could’ve sworn it was meLights off, I'm not here
Wish that you would call me "dear"
But now you can't
You know it's not right
You'll never know
What it's like
Used to think I liked you
But all you do is make me blue
You don't care
And I can't resist
I guess I'll have to
Forget you existSweet 18, always trying
Sweet 16, always trying
To be something
Paint a picture on the wall
You like puppy dogs
You get bored of me
How I'm so naive
So naive
I won't be another girl
You kissed
Just a girl
You wish you hadn't missed
Hadn't missed
I'm almost 17
Maybe then I'll know what you mean
I still don't want you
To speak to meTurn off the lights
Time for you and I to be at ease
Taste of your lips
Sweetest wine that's ever been
I'll take a sip
Drunk on it, I'll never sleep
Through the lights, I saw your body
Your mind, your soul, it embodies
Sunday morning rolls around
Silence is the most comfortable soundI'll suppress the things I don’t like about me
Put 'em in a hole where I don’t know what exists
Can’t take the bad out of me
Do you think I could use it for good do you agree?
It’s not something I wanna share with you
It’s a part of me that makes me wanna hurt you
I wanna tell the world
What I have to say
Maybe it’ll turn out bad
Or maybe I’m insane
If I would I could
If I would I could
If I would I could
If I would I couldSomething about your blue eyes
They reel me in with the moonlight
I'll be quite honest I was scared
Of how I'd survive the sea
And I can't get out of my head
Circling thoughts roll around my brain
What are you thinking? What am I doing? What is happening?
Maybe things would fall into place
But I have this feeling in my gut
That this could be something good for us
'Cause when I see you again
I think of you more than just a friend
I think of you more than just a friend
I think of you more than just a friendI know you don't know me
But I wanna know you
I'll just dream of you
I wanna call you baby
But I think maybe
You'd say that I'm ugly
And I know it's getting late
And you've probably got a date
Who do you have to run to, run to, run to?
And I know I'm not the best
But we both like romance
And I'll give you a kiss or two
You don't look at me
You don't even notice me
But you're still my cutie
I know that this will end
But I sure do intend
To love you just as much as I canI Live in LA - Famous Dex Soundcloud

Didn't think I could be anything I want
You say you like me
Or at least I hear, through the atmosphere
Never have I ever wanted to kiss you
I put my finger down 'cause it's all I wanna do
Tell me all the things you like
Never have I ever wanted to be in your life
Never have I ever wanted to be in your life
I put my finger down 'cause that's a lieWhere the sidewalk ends it's hard to tell
I used to read that book by the wishing well
Take it off, take it off, your t-shirt
In the lake, in the lake, in the summer
Slip my blazers on
I don’t care about the mud that got on them
When will you come back to Boston?
It's getting harder without youOh, you
You never hurt nobody
Always treat me so bad
Why do you make me cry
When I think about your eyes
Why, why, why, why
Why does my baby cry
Tell me what
You want to do
Tell me what
You want to do
I think I am losing you
I remember when we sat on the grass
I knew that you'd always be true
Did it hurt when I said goodbye
I hope it made you wanna cry
It was just a little game, you wanted to play
Tell me this
Oh, tell me that
I don't even want youIf I asked you
You would tell me that you lied
You lied
I want to be your friend
But you don't understand
If I wanted to be a part of something
I wouldn't ask you
I wouldn't ask you
I wouldn't ask you
I wouldn't ask youRip off the bandage of your past
And talk to me when you're alone
I know it's hard not to suffer when
There's no place you call home
Sticking up for me
Haven't talked in centuries
I know it's tough to understand that we're apart
For good
I want to know you better than I did two years ago
Things could be easier, I know that we both know
It's hard for me to forget you
It's hard for me to forget
It's hard for me to survive
It's hard to surviveI feel like I've met you before
You're just too easy to adore
You sing just like the whispering, moaning 
My, oh my, you look just like an angel does
What will this do to me?
I'm not too scared to see my heart break
'Cause I know it'll be romantic
'Cause I know it'll be romantic
'Cause it's all for love
For loveIt's getting late
Oh, when I call you on the phone and talk until day
You smile at me
My heart melts away and I can't breathe
When no one's around
I swear you can hear my heart beat
I love you so dearly
I think it'll drown me
Maybe I'll go home and dream in your arms for a little while
Spend all my years with you
Oh love, I'd walk a million miles
'Till the day I see my robot boy
I'll wait for the train
And rest my brain
All that'll come is joyHow long are you staying for?
Coffee's already cold
Pick up your bag, say "Nice knowing you"
Don't think I was ready for you to knowI would say I'm sorry
If I thought that it could change your mind
But I know that this time
I have said too much
Been too unkind
I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try and laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
Because boys don't cry
Boys don't cry
I would break down at your feet
And beg forgiveness
Plead with you
But I know that it's too late
And now there's nothing I can do
So I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
Because boys don't cry
Oh, boys don't cry
Boys don't cry
No boys don't cryI don't wanna have to ask for
A Valentine
I know I can't let go
Of your hand sometimes
Close to you
Is where I wanna be
Count the freckles
On your body
I don't wanna have to ask for
A kiss
Something I wish I didn't
Have to miss
Drew a dog
On the palm
Of your hand
Hope it's still there
When I see you againPeople seem to want to leave once they get to know me
It's never what I planned, I don't want to take your hand
It's never what I wanted to be
Never what I wanted to be
Look at your hand after you touch me
Do you feel different? Are you just 
It's never what I wanted it to be
Never what I wanted to beBeen a while since I've made up my mind
Talk to you on the telephone
Made a mess I know
Made a mess I know
Made a mess I know
In these streets in the city
I never tell you where I'm going
I never know
I understand
I understand
I understand
I won't get upset
I won't get upset
I won't get up
Said I need itI never thought I'd ever be left alone
I did feel like I was the only one for
I guess that isn't really how it seems
Cause you've got me locked up in a dream
I'll take some time alone
Still hurts deep, I don't tell you so
I guess that isn't really how it seems
Cause you've got me locked up in a dreamI don't wanna go to the party
I'll just sit and wait around
I don't wanna go to the party
I'll just sit at home and wait around
Wait around
It doesn't 
Oh, it doesn't 
Oh, the things I didn't know about
Oh, wait around
Not much longer, now I won't wait around
AnymoreI don't feel this way
I don't wanna feel this way
I don't feel that way
I don't wanna feel that way
I like you but I feel...

You want to disagree that
Your favorite song is one of mine
We sit on on the grass while your back
Gets the sun to kiss it instead of me
Water to place, hot days
You laugh as I cry
You don't mind the way it shines
But it gave me a sunburnYou might've guessed, I'm quitting again
Can't keep losing sleep over it
Try to play pretend, try to make amends
With the last boy that I knew
That I grew close to
Gonna get married
Gonna have babies, I guess?
I close my eyes to forget
I'm drunk again, make my way to the lady
In the back of the room
She asked me, "Why are you hiding from me?"
Swear I didn't mean it
Know I'm just getting used to change
In things I knew
Things I grew up with
Things I screwed up too
They don't touch me the way that you do
I'm back in bloom
Soon back to crooning
'Til I get scared again
When I get scared again
I knew deep down
I knew deep down
I knew deep down

I think about holding your hands in mine
You were asleep and you were counting sheep
I'm wide awake with heartache
But you thought it will pass, I know that it will last
You see, we've only got two more weeks
I read about your sign too much
You're all around me when you're thinking
I can't wait to go on a date
Can't wait to see you're a Libra
A LibraSometimes I know what's right for me
And I'll be here waiting, yeah
Baby, show me all that I can do
I could be the one to guide you through
Baby, take my hand and I'll show you the way
Bring you a little closer, tell you it's okay
I don't wanna be something you can throw away
Baby, take my hand and I'll show you the way
Bring you a little closer, tell you it's okay
I don't wanna be something you can throw away
And I'm falling so hard for you 
Would you be there to catch me, too?

Bring me back to Georgia when I was a kid
Perfect scenes and I'm reading
About me or him, how God, I wanna be
Someone important to everybody
Hey Claire, are you proud of yourself now?
Pushed away the only vows you knew before
You opened the door and never looked back
Don't you see you could've turned back?
Bring me back to Georgia, a little bit older
I promise I'll take up the offer
Go fishin' with Grandad, skip rocks with Abigail
Wash the clothes, my mother picked out the detail
Just wait another 20 years
It'll feel the same as it does right now
It'll feel the same as it does right now
Just wait another 20 years
It'll feel the same as it does right nowEveryone is gone
I turn the light on
He shook me around
Drove on the wrong side of the road
A bakers dozen of bad affairs
But along came Ronnie
I climb up the space between
I'm bitter like olives
That's why you like them and I don't
Rarely
In the mirror hulking
That's why you like me and I don't
Leonie
I'm lonely
Put pipe cleaner gold around me
Leonie
I'm lonely
I'm sitting where we'd sit but now it's different
Meet me at the pier
Cigarettes and beer
I'll cut your hair I don't care
Germany takes you from meDrive to your house
My cheeks are red
I drive by your house
Too nervous I might drop dead
I'm driving to your house
Smash all the little pieces
You don't seem to mind
You've got me stashed in your creases
Tiny bits of blood
In between deep
Got into a fight
A melted heart underneath
I'm burning a hole
Between my knuckles
A tiny space for love
Fill it with your honey soulSorry I didn't kiss you
But it's obvious I wanted to
Bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse
But my luck couldn't get any worse
'Cause I swa–
'Cause I swa–
'Cause I swa–
'Cause I swa-
Swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin
'Cause we swa–
'Cause we swa–
'Cause we swa–
'Cause we swa-
You look so nice in your shirt
It's sad because it just hurts
I'd do anything for you
But would you do that for me, too?Put on your shoes 'cause that's what they want you to do
Put on your makeup, I've got too many scars to make up for it
I've never been to Insomnia Cookies
Maybe it's because all I do is worry
About you
About you
About you
About you
Looking for the signs
Do you wanna hold mine?
Running out of time
The hourglass is almost on one side
So do you love me like I love you?
Burning question you're the only one in the roomI'll get aggressive now
Don’t have a choice won’t let you down
How did they ever get this far
I couldn’t tell you why I’m lost
Why I’m lost, why I'm lost
Why I’m lost, why I’m lost
In the summer, I'll unfold
My country with no hand to hold
Home of the free only for the white and manly
Oh the white and manlySuccess for my buddies
Success for my friends
Success is the only thing I understand
Head back home to the place I grew up
Give my medals to the ones that I love
I'll chase Harvey through the door in the wall
He says
"Never catch me never miss me at all"
Drool comes down from the corner of his mouth
I say
"I love you Harvey, you cut it out"
I love winning baby I want it all
I wanna prove that I got the balls
Harvey keeps on playing with his food
He doesn't understand what big boys do
He wakes up in the middle of the night
I run in and turn on the light
Run my hands through his short black hair
I say
"I love you Harvey I don't care"In the summer
In the heat
You're the greatest
Boy I'll ever need
Ever need
Ever need
Ever need
I'm sorry
I kissed him again
You know he broke my heart
Right to the brim
To the brim
To the brim
To the brimI'm really missing you
It's impossible for me to see you in blue
Things I could do
Things I could say to get you back
It wouldn't work anyway
What is love all about?
What is it all about?
What am I missing about?
What am I missing?
About you
Dreaming of you
Dreaming of you
I'm so blue
I'm so blueIt's quiet on my floor
Except for the gospel ladies
Just the smell of some wicked candles
Makes me think into the coldest sound
They wear light-rimmed hats and joyful smiles
Who loved to run up the street branch
And in the middle of it is a puddle of water
Wind of faithful voicesPiles of papers and you're not bothered
You like to watch people on the subway
You wonder whats inside their mind
Who are the ones they love?
You dont think of things normally
You're too busy to be sad about anything
I like the way we can sit and talk
Lose track of time and realize it's 1 o'clock
My friend Emma you're a funny one
You like to think of things looking from upside down
I'll ask you a question and you won't answer
You'll smile and say get rid of that frownMy name is Sandy; I'm 14 years old
My friends say I'm ugly
But my dad says I'm the prettiest thing
The prettiest thing
The prettiest thing
The prettiest thing
The prettiest thing
My name is Sandy; I'm 14 years old
And sometimes I hate you
But right now I just wanna go home
Just wanna go home
Just wanna go home
Just wanna go home
Just wanna go home
My name is Sandy; I'm 14 years old
My brother says he hates me
And Satan is his master
My name is Sandy; I'm 14 years old
My insides are changing
And right now I just wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up
I just wanna grow upI wanted to glow all night
I want you to know that I was right
So I tell myself that I
Won't take you back
I won't take you back
I tell you the truth
You tell it to me too
I know I need you
You know that we are throughWhite bird in a black cloud
You flap
Eyes rolled back
Medicine gave you a heart attack
Big fight for a small right
First flight
Into white light
Pull the trigger love at first bite
Big plan for a big man
Tough change
For a tough guy
Twitchin out the corner of your eye
White bird in a black cloud
Rain comin down
Thinkin' “hey maybe we should turn this boat around”
Heaven maybe freedom
What's the word
Right, I forgot
Quiet is the closest thing we gotCaught me by surprise
I've been thinking of you, tonight
Every time me I leave
It gets harder and harder to try
I don't wanna die
Without trying something new
Baby, I've got a good feeling that it could be youSubway center we're making out
I miss the days we'd just hang out
Animal Collective from your stereo
With no other place to go
Visiting friends, your Winter's love
I could've been your Winter's love
Your heart's all broken, that's what you said
You want to cry? Go right ahead
Curled up on your kitchen floor
You'd tell me about your sores
Your eyes are mysterious visions and
You don't waste it no more
No reason did I find
That you would say goodbye
Until I saw you with her
And you looked just fineHello?
Are you into me, like I'm into you?
Do you wanna do the things I wanna do with you?
You're so close, and yet so far
I wonder how you look when you're in the dark

Ready to die
Ready to dieCould this be a melody?
Dissolved from the ground
I don't know the things you said
I cut 'em out of my head
Could this be the jealousy?
Of the week I started to mess up
I was searching for you
But it was in the dark at night of the blueOh you're sleeping in the morning light
Never would I wake up your sweet eyes
Laying down with the dogs
I couldn't see my mother through the fogI wanna talk to you, but you know I can't possibly do that
It's just a habit I have
I dyed my hair blonde two days after you left
I feel better
Maybe I'll go purple or white
Just as long as you can't recognize me from behind
It's not that I am trying to avoid you
I just have to forget what you said about my blue
I supposeYou are the best that I've ever known
You are so sweet, but you don't speak a tone
Tucker my doggy, where did you go?
Run down the hill now, you're oh so slow
I feed you ice cream even though you're not
Supposed to, supposed to
You are the Sun and you are the Earth
If I should lose you it will hurtHow you felt in my hands
How you felt in my hands
How you felt in my hands
How you felt in my hands
How you felt in my hands
How you felt in my hands
How you felt in my hands 
In my hands
I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me too
I could be a pretty girl
Won't ever make you blue
I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you
I was so blinded by you, now I cry
Just thinking bout the fool that I was
I was such a fool!
I'm alone now but its better for me
I don't need all your negativityAstro or in old language
A couple thousand years ago, disciples
Those who are trying to prepare themselves
For entry into the evolutionary level, above human
Synonymous with the Kingdom of God
The kingdom of heaven
Heaven, heaven, heaven
My heart, I never feel, I never see, I never know

I'm not as tall as all this snow
My friends and I walk through st. marks
Where you kissed me by search and destroy and it makes me wanna barf
Nick got a painting for free today
He doesn't really know what it is anyway
I get back home and slam my door
My world revolves around things that make me sore
Ohh
Once I'm at home there's nobody to call
Oohh
Just wait for the train, until then stare at drywall
Jumping beans at the lake and wet grass
Summer's almost here it's coming fast
The bottoms of my shoes are wet from the snow
But at least i don't feel like your average joe
Ohh
Once I'm at home there's nobody to call
Oohh
Just wait for the train until then stare at drywallI never say your name
But I wrote these chords with you in mind
I've met you on the benches
Of places where I know we can still hide
Sometimes it’s hard
'Cause I just wanna call you and cry
Seated in my future, ready for the ultimate sign
If timing is everything
Baby, I will make some more time
I've missed you by the minute
I’d give myself to have you one last time
I want more time
I want more time
I want more time
I want more time
I want more time
I want more, more time
I want more, more timeAnd I don't
It can't be found in a movie or a book, take a look
Every day, I say that I won't, and I don't
Could you erase that look on your face, in my place, in my place?
And I don't
All my friends in the bad part of town, they run down
They run down
Every day, I say that I won't, and I don't
12:44, there's a knock on my door, you want moreLiving with the birds and bees
But I wanna go where
There's nobody
Nobody, but me
If you wanna come along
I'll carry you like a 
So long
So long
So long
So long
It's not that simple
But you can go back to your 
Nobody, but me
All the birds and bees
I wanna go where there's nobody
Nobody
NobodyClose the door
I want some privacy, finally
And baby it's been so long, do you remember my body, my body?
You don't have to look further, I've got you, I can't hurt ya
That I've been gone so long
Things that I can't control, slip away before I know
I don't want this to go away
I think we should go so far away from here, so far away from here
I know a place
Places that we can go in-between the cracks and I'll just tell you everything I know
And I'll just tell you everything I know
And I'll just tell you everything I know
And I'll just tell you everything I know
And I'll just tell you everything I knowWait, wait, I wait for Kate
I wait, I wait for Kate so late
Demonstrate, my Kate, we mateOh, you're going to New York?
I'm going there
Why don't I come with you?
Oh, you've changed to L.A.?
I'm going there
I've thrown my hat in the ring
I've got nothing to lose
With you, with you, with you
I'm in that kind of moodSworn to secrecy
Knew it wouldn't happen for me
I fend off other people
Who try to get in, who try to see
Learned from my mistakes
Or at least think I have
Underestimated Los Angeles
Underestimated what I'd see in you
I'm drunk again, I should be embarrassed
But you embrace it, don't make me feel nervous
Oh, I wanted to be
Close to you
Let you in, I should be so helpless
But you changed me, romantic again
I've been jaded
Learned to think with consequences
Guess I was waiting on you
I've been waiting my whole life, been waiting my whole life
But I guess I didn't know what was in front of me
Didn't know what I couldn't see
I just wish I could have it for me
I just wish I could have it for me
I just wish I could have it for me
I just wish that I could
I just wish that I couldI never walk about after dark
It’s my point of view
Cause someone could break your neck
Coming up behind you
Always coming and you'd never have a clue
And now I look behind all the time
I will wait forever
Always looking straight
Thinking counting all the hours you wait
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
And now another clue
I would ask if you could help me out
It's hard to understand
Cause when you're running by yourself
It's hard to find someone to hold your hand
You know it’s good to be tough like me
But I will wait forever
I need someone else
To look into my eyes and tell me
"Girl, you know you've got to watch your health"
To look into my eyes and tell me
Lalalalala
To look into my eyes and tell me
Lalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalala
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark nightNot to  you someone I'll be
I'm standing in a courtyard close to where my mom would be
Not all my plans for you are safe, no lock, no key
I'm clinging onto nothing, I'm holding out for sympathy
I like when I can be alone, without a phone
And I can have a drink when I'm going through it
I like when I don't know the news
I'm locked away in someone's room
I'll find out if it's worth readin' this week
Not that I'd wish for anything other than this
I thought of it for a while and now it's here and I exist
Could've been the one who helps you check your credit
Or maybe a therapist for the divorced children
I like when I can be alone, without a phone
And I can have a drink when I'm going through it
I like when I don't know the news
I'm locked away in someone's room
I'll find out if it's worth readin' this weekOn my way to North Georgia, feels like I'm falling for you
If I get too close, will you pull me under?
I don't want to talk, you're on my mind all day long
If it seems so right, why does it feel so wrong?
Why does it feel so feel so wrong? 
Why does it feel so feel so wrong?
Feeling so high up in your styrofoam cup
I'm coming down, I'm coming down
Feeling so high up, airy mountains, crew cuts
I'm coming down, I'm coming down 
Coming down, I'm coming down
Maybe we'll come back upstate
Maybe someday, maybe someday
Maybe we'll come back upstate
Maybe someday, maybe someday
Maybe we'll come back upstate
Maybe someday, maybe someday
Maybe we'll come back upstate
Maybe someday, maybe someday
Maybe someday 
Maybe someday
Give my love to you 
Give my love to you, ooh 
Give my love to you 
Give my love to you, ooh 
Give my, give my
Give my, give my love 
Give my love to you
My love to you, ohChristmas, Twin Falls, Idaho
Is her oldest memory
She was only two
The first time she felt blue
Cafeteria, Harrison
Elementary
Beneath a parachute
I saw her without shoes
7 up, I touched her thumb
And she knew it was me
Alhough she couldn't see
Unless, of course, she peeked
My mom's good, she got me out of
Twin Falls, Idaho
Before I got too old
You know how that goes
That's where she still was the summer
She turned 17
In 1983
Three weeks after me
Last I heard was she had twins
Or maybe it was three
Although I've never seen
Except for in my dreamsI'm in a box
I'll try to get
I'll try to get out
I'm in a box
I'll try again
I'll try again
Leaving when my plane lands
I'll be on the receiving end
Take a look
Out the window
Do you see me down the road?
I don't wanna be a carbon copy
I don't wanna be a carbon copy
Of the people you knew
Before meHow are you?
I ask
With a whisper
Of 
There are ghosts
Under my back
They're there
In my head
But I know that they're just 
I can burn the pages of things I can't say
To you
Or anyone
I ever met
They're just fading
All the friends that I
Can't call
Oh, the friends that I
Can't callYou've got nice eyes
They're very blue
That is why I look at you
I look at you
I look at you
I look at you
I look at you
I look at you
Making a list
Of people to kiss
The list is a million you's long
Just you's all the way down
Olive oil soft
And laundry warm
I know I like you
I just don't know what for
With my boy Ronnie
Listening to Connie
I couldn't stop if I tried
I will love you til I die
OhIt may as well have been forgotten
Or did it simply slip your mind?
Is that my heart that's splitting open?
I guess it just fell to the side
I've tried my best to keep you smiling, love
Maybe it's been all in vain
But I would try a million times, my dear
Tell me would you do the same?
One could say it's complicated, love
Like nothing they've seen before
Or simply that it is a thought we share
Forever it must be ignored
If you really love me, there's no way to tell
I'm always arriving when you say farewell
In all of my dreams we are husband and wife
I'll never forget you all of my life
I'll never forget you all of my life
I'll never forget you all of my lifeHow are you today?
I saw your friends band play
A little show last night
It's not my thing
They were alright
You're in my dream last week
I'd like to hear what you think
We passed a house driving fast
The sun was shining on the grass
You made me stop and leave the car
You pulled my sleeve but not too hard
Remember when you took too much
I didn't mind being your crutch
We loved you then
It's not the same
I don't like how things change
I don't like how things change
I don't like how things changeOh, I wash my hair
Certain people 
I only 
 monsters
With the fashion 
Glowing in my handHe can only hold her for so long
The lights are on but no one's home
She's so vacant her soul is taken
He thinks "What's she running from?"
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
Because what's inside her never dies
Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses
The man she misses
The man that he longs to be
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
But what's inside of her never dies
So he tries to pacify her
Because what's inside her, it never dies
It never dies, it never dies
It never dies, it never dies
It never dies, it never
It never, it never diesI'm not leaving
Without a proper goodbye
'Cause I'm an asshole
And this is my goodbye, oh no
What's your deal?
I've got nowhere to hide
Stuck in this dust bowl
And I'm terrified, oh no
It's not as hard as people say
But people always talk shit anyway
It's not as hard as I make it out to be
You're fine my darling
I'm a stray dog
I've got these old school eyes
I've got no self-control
So kick me out of your house, oh no
I'm so lost
Without someone to remind
Me I'm an asshole
I never said goodbye, oh no
It's not as hard as people say
But people always talk shit anyway
It's not as hard as I make it out to be
You're fine my darlingBright boy I can help you
If you let me take your hand
Bring you right to promise land
Bring you right to promise
Bright boy I could love you
If you let me be your wife
Love you so for all my life
Love you so for all my
Waiting by the water
You return with eyes cast down
Bright boy what has made you frown
Bright boy what has made you
Waiting by the water
Sun is setting by the sea
Bright boy please return to me
Bright boy please return to
Bright boy I can help you
If you let me take your hand
Bring you right to promise land
Bring you right to promiseWas I more than it's worth
Or will you see my name and I'll fade?
Pitch my camp in your mind
Sat by the fire, behind your eyes
And I'll look through them just once or twice
But I might see something I don't like
Like your hands in his shirt
Entwined in cotton, his loving smirk
Losing my way
Seeing your name, but I'll be, I'll be fine
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Losing my way
Seeing your name
I'll be, I'll be fine
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahBorn in a hurry, always late
Haven't been early since '88
Texas is hot, I can be cold
Grandma cried when I pierced my nose
Good in a glass, good on green
Good when you're putting your hands all over me
I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn, yeah
In Tennessee, the sun's goin' down
But in Beijing, they're heading out to work
You know the bar down the street don't close for an hour
We should take a walk and look at all the flowers
'Cause I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn
Whatever feels good
Old soul, waiting my turn
I know a few things, but I still got a lot to learn
So I'm alright with a slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
I'm alright with a slow burnGetting outta my head and my bed
Walk down the house steps
People in this town aren't forgiving
Take a little time there might be something
Walking along the pier
Ships sail away from here
I wish I was a sailor
Curse out all the things that make me feel like a failureIt's getting harder
It’s getting harder without you
Sometimes I feel crazy
Holding onto broken wounds
Oh, winter is coming
Take me home
Take me back to your room
Oh, and sometimes I feel crazy
Bruise my skin and feel it all over
Everything’s changing
Everything’s changing about you
Oh, and
Everything’s changing
Everything’s changing about you
On Monday morning
Tears of an angel
I heard you
Oh and
Won’t you come back
Back to the nest
The one that once held you
Oh and
Everything’s changing
Everything’s changing about you
Oh and
Everything’s changing
Everything’s changing about you
Oh and
Everything’s changing
Everything’s changing about you
Oh and
Everything’s changing
Everything’s changing about you          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        You just got pranked <3The siren won't  unless I'm half-asleep
It comes back in the mornin'
The smoking gun still lingers
Even as I lie it down to breathe
A quick trip to the bathroom sink
How am I supposed to be satisfied
When all I do is pick the random sign?
But it's the one that seems right, it's a losing fight
Right now, my sister's working harder I ever did
Using the same cloak and the same skin
The emblem reminds us all to win
And maybe she'll have twins
And if I should be the godmother or become 
If we're the only ones to make it
And if we're the only ones who care
Bury  my own harsh bones swinging on the wicker chair

        Time rolls the back wheels of my mind
You helped me put the brakes on, 'cause you're kind
I wonder where you learned to be so good
And I wonder if I'm doing the best that I could
I could be somewhere else, I should be someone else, but
You wouldn't know me if I was
You'd say I was a stranger, just because
You'd say I wasn't weak enough for you
You'd want me just to feel as you do too
I could be somewhere else, I should be someone else, but
You shouldn't tell me what to do
I'll only take the brakes off if you do
And roll around like marbles on the floor
Please pick me up and roll me out the door
I could be somewhere else, I should be someone else, but
I guess I'm happy as I am
Sometimes I find it hard to be a man
It's easier just to play the same old games
Of trying to forget my bloody name
I could be somewhere else, I should be someone else, but
How are you, mister?
I know what I'm called
It's just, you got me
You got me, you got me stalledThere's a blue light
In my best friend's room
There's a blue light
In his eye
There's a blue light, yeah
I want to see it
Shine
There's a ship
That sails by my window
There's a ship that sails on by
There's a world under it
I think I see it
Sailing away
I think it's sailing
Miles crashing me by
Crashing me by
Crashing me by
There's a world
Outside my doorstep
Flames over
Everyone's hot
Don't you see them shining
I want to hear them
Beating for me
I think I hear them
Waves crashing me by
Crashing me by
Crashing me byHow you felt in my hands
How you felt in my hands
How you felt in my hands
How you felt in
How you felt in my hands
How you felt in my hands
How you felt in my hands 
In my hands
I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me to
I could be a pretty girl
Won't ever make you blue
I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you
I was so blinded by you, now I cry
Just thinking 'bout the fool that I was
I was such a fool
I'm alone now but it's better for me
I don't need all your negativity
I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me toPolaroid of you dancing in my room
I want to remember
I think it was about noon
It's getting harder to understand, to understand
How you felt in my hands 
I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me too
I could be a pretty girl
Won't ever make you blue
I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you
I was so blinded by you, now I cry
Just thinking bout the fool that I was
I was such a fool!
I'm alone now but its better for me
I don't need all your negativity
I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me too
I could be a pretty girl
Won't ever make you blue
I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in youI don't love you anymore
Since when?
Now, just now
I don't wanna lie
Can't tell the truth, so
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin
You look so nice in your shirt
It's sad because it just hurts
I'd do anything for you
But would you do that for me, too?
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grinHere she comes
Where's she know?
Oh, now I wanna go now
Because I know I can't stay
Oh, taking me away
Taking me away now
She 
She's the one that I wantSorry I didn't kiss you
But it's obvious I wanted to
Bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse
But my luck couldn't get any worse
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin
You look so nice in your shirt
It's sad because it just hurts
I'd do anything for you
But would you do that for me, too?
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grinSuccumb to the line
The finishing time
The long distance runner
Has stopped on the corner
But I won't give up although
I've stopped too
Before the end of me and you
The patchwork explains
The land is unchanged
Interpret the rules
My tears in the typing pool
The letters are sighing
The ink is still drying
I told you the truth
And now I sigh too
The page turns on me and you
Across that white plane
The land is unchangedPut on your boots
And walk with me
Over the freeway
And down to the sea
That's where we can always go
When we really wanna know
We sit by the window
And we watch the rain
Each little drop has got a name
They're falling down
They're hitting the ground
They're washing all the people away
Go on the roof and we'll see the sky
Let the world pass us by
We can make it all turn grey
If we really want it that way
Paint me a picture of the way you feel
Close your eyes and make it real
Sing me a song of the place you see
We can go there, just you and me
You don't have to smile if you don't want to
I don't have to smile if I don't want to
We don't have to smile if we don't want toOut here
Barely see my breath
Surrounded
By jealousy and death
I can't be reached
Only had one call
Dragged underneath
Separate from you all
You all
This time
Lost my own return
In spite of
Everything I've learned
I hid my tracks
Spit out all my air
Slipped into cracks
Stripped of all my cares
My cares
I'm so tired
Sheep are counting me
No more struggle
No more energy
No more patience
You can write that down
It's all too crazy
And I'm not sticking around
I'm not sticking around
I'm not sticking around
I'm not sticking around
I'm not sticking aroundLet's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know 
Your mother should know 
Sing it again
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know 
Your mother should know 
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know 
Your mother should know
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know 
Your mother should know
Lift up your hearts and sing me a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know 
Your mother should know
Your mother should know 
Your mother should know
Da da dada da da da dada dada dada da da
Da dada da da
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know 
Your mother should know
Your mother should know 
Your mother should know
Your mother should know 
Your mother should knowYesterday I got so old
I felt like I could die
Yesterday I got so old
It made me want to cry
Go on, go on
Just walk away
Your choice is made
Go on, go on
And disappear
Go on, go on
Away from here
And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
Inbetween without you
Without you
Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child
Yesterday away from you
It froze me deep inside
Come back come back
Don't walk away
Come back, come back
Come back today
Come back, come back
Why can't you see
Come back, come back
Come back to me
And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me
And be her in between
Without you
Without youCome with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I want to tell you
How much I love you
Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you
Come with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I want to tell you
How much I love you
I love youTen decisions shape your life
You'll be aware of five about
Seven ways to go through school
Either you're noticed or left out
Seven ways to get ahead
Seven reasons to drop out
When I said, "I can see me in your eyes"
You said, "I can see you in my bed"
That's not just friendship, that's romance, too
You like music we can dance to
Sit me down, shut me up
I'll calm down and I'll get along with you
There is a time when we all fail
Some people take it prеtty well
Some peoplе take it all out on themselves
Some they just take it out on friends
Oh, everybody plays the game
And if you don't you're called insane
Don't, don't, don't, don't, it's not safe no more
I've got to see you one more time
That’s when you were born
In 1984
Sit me down, shut me up
I'll calm down and I'll get along with you
Oh, Everybody was well dressed
And everybody was a mess
Six things without fail you must do
So that your woman loves just you
Oh, all the girls played mental games
And all the guys were dressed the same
Why not try it all
If you only remember it once?
Ooh ooh
Sit me down, shut me up
I'll calm down and I'll get along with youFeel the same as it is
Oh, feel the same as it was
It don't feel the same She sees the world for what it is
Unlike most  separated
One of these days I'll know I'll become cold
I'm 21, my eyes are open
The clocks do their worst to me
Promised to wait, September again
Just like I've promised these last few years
I'd like to believe that there's better, something better
If I'm so strong, why am I afraid to disappear?
I'm too far gone
I could be better just 
Teach me to be more like you
Chained to, chained to
Chained toI think I'll always be
Melancholy, man
When all is said and done
It's just the way I am
I'll cry at the sun
Not 'cause it bothers me
I can't help that my eyes
Were born with sensitivity
If things were different
Don't you think I'd understand
Your favorite art pieces
Fibers made by hand
It all goes over my head
Everything everyone says
How can I get through the rough
When everyone I know is tougher
Let me
Let me
I think I'll always be
A melancholy girl
When all is said and done
It's just the way I amWake up or go to sleep
Why even try?
Why even try?
This all feels the same in me
I'm ready to die
I'm ready to die
Tell me, what's it like?
Death-cold paradise
Death-cold paradise
Tell me, what's inside?
Tell me, what's inside?
Tell me, what's it like?
Death-cold paradise
Death-cold paradise
Tell me, what's inside?
Tell me, what's inside?
Why even try?
Why even try?
Ready to die
Ready to dieIs it all that you wanted it to say?
Is it all that you wanted to give?
When  I'm dreadin'
When 
Tell me a place I can go
I need to get away from all the turbulence I'm experiencing
It's turbulence, you're inside out
I'm leaving
I'm leaving
I'm leavingAll I know, I got to be
With you, no reason not to be
Next to you, you next to me
Holding you, you're holding me
Time again, I want to leave
The way you look at me
I could be away from here
With no one, just you
All I want is you
I love you
Gladly, gladly, gladly
All I want is you
I love you
Gladly, gladly, gladly
I don't want to sound so serious
But you are taking me away from all this hate
All it takes, all it takes
Is your arms, your smile
I like you
You're like to me
Closer than I've ever been
I want you around me
Always, always
All I want is you
I love you
Gladly, gladly, gladly 
All I want is you 
I love you
Gladly, gladly, gladly
Feels like it's raining, super soak
Feels like it's raining, super soak
Feels like it's raining, super soak
Feels like it's raining, super soakYoung and full of runnin', tell me where's that taken me?
Just a great figure eight or a tiny infinity
Love is really nothing but a dream that keeps waking me
For all of my trying, we still end up dying
How can it be?
Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
You're about set fire to everything that I see
I want you so bad, I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me
Forget about me, yeah
Forget about  me
So young, full of running all the way to the edge of desire, baby
Steady my breathing, silently screaming, "I have to have you now"
Wired and I'm tired, think I'll sleep in my clothes on the floor
Maybe this mattress will spin on its axis and find me on yours 
Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
'Cause I'm just about to set fire to everything that I see
I want you so bad, I'll go back on the things that I believe
But there I just said, I'm scared you'll forget about me
Scared you'll forget about me, yeah
Scared you'll forget
Scared you'll forget about me, yeah
So scared so many days have drifted away
but we'll have plenty more
tucker i love you, but so do hundreds and hundreds moreTu-tu-ru-tu-tu
Tu-ru-tu-tu-tu
Tu-tu-ru-tu-tu
Tu-ru-tu-tu-tu
Tu-tu-ru-tu-tu
Tu-ru-tu-tu-tu
Every time you look at me
I try to look the other way
Not because your stupid
It's cos, your in my way
You broke my heart once
And I didn’t like that
Cos you fuckin' used me
And I didn't know that
Until then
What do you mean that
I never liked you?
Cos you were annoying
And you always
Hated me
And Hated Me
Boyfriend or boy, as a friend
It’s easy just to pretend
You just fucked
With my heart
And you get the pain back
Pain back
Oh, you'll get the pain back
Pain Back
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I wanna be the one you think about at night
And I wanna be the one that you would put up a fight for
You know that I adore
That even when you’re bored
I’d buy you anything and everything I can't affordSometimes I feel like I just wanna go back to my old ways
You're telling me I'm silly
"It's no fun in the old days"
I'm such a romantic
I never remember how things truly happened
I guess you're attractive
Or something
"Live in the moment"
That's what they tell me
But what ever happened
To when you would hold me
And hold me
And hold me?
"Girlfriend" or "Girl, that's a friend"?
It's easy just to pretend
That we don't have something real
It's just how we feel
We feel
Oh, it's just how we feel
How we feel
I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling something, right?
I wanna be the one you think about at night
And I wanna be the one that you would put up a fight for
You know that I adore
That even when you're bored
I'd buy you anything and everything I can't affordI could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me too
I could be a pretty girl
Won't ever make you blue
I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you
I was so blinded by you, now I cry
Just thinking bout the fool that I was
I was such a fool!
I'm alone now but its better for me
I don't need all your negativity
I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me too
I could be a pretty girl
Won't ever make you blue
I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in youLayin' on my bed
A funny feelin' in my head
Lookin' at pictures of your dog
Hey sweet puppy I wanna talk
