Don't worry about a bitch who never been in your place 
Always move in silence, never question your fate
Always check in on your niggas, gotta make sure they straight 
If I'm getting money, then you know we all got a plate 
Since a baby in her tummy, mama knew I was great
They can't play me like a dummy, they know what not to take
Fuck these niggas, 'cause the money only thing I'ma chase
Time is precious, that's the only thing I try not to waste 
She hatin' 'cause I'm up, you can tell on her face

Probably one of these bitches' heads, I'm better than all the rest
No this is not a drill, hoe, this shit is not a test
I think you need to roll out, catch you actin' too hesitant

These bitches keep on testin' me, I hope that I don't catch a sentence
I see everyone who doubted me and I'ma make yo' ass a witness
You really gotta be kidding 
You thought you was competition? 
What the fuck you lookin' at?
Lil girl, you need to mind your business 
In the coupe, throwin' money out the roof
With my dogs, and you already know they gon' shoot
Run down on yo' ass, lil bitch, give me the loot
See me out in real life and they don't know what to do
I'm doin' what I can with this money in my hand
You can bet I got a plan, I need that cash like on demand

Smoking so much gas, I forgot to put my mask on
Nails razor sharp, called you off my iPhone
Let me hold my hair for you while you put my ice on
I shine with the lights off, he hates when I don't call
We might hang out once a month, then I'm going AWOL
You need me to win the game, I guess I'm an 8-ball
Two months without me, guess you're having withdrawals
He on my hip like a Tamagotchi
Leave a heart on my wall so I can know you like me 
I'm important, can't be seen with just anybody 
We was late, but we still pulled up to the party 
This time won't be nothing like the last one
Smoking so much gas, I forgot to put my mask on 
Nails razor sharp, called you off my iPhone
Let me hold my hair for you while you put my ice on
Baby, sometimes this life can get lonely
But I love it when you hold me
Love me like I was your only, only
I think I need my space
You still end up at my place
Can't go back to my old ways
Time is now and I can't wait
I'm in love with a nightmare
What you lookin' for? I'm right here
Face the demons, though, I'm not scared
I need your love and it's not fair
He said, "I think my phone is hacked" 
I think my phone is tapped 
I think you've got me blocked 
Why won't you call me back? 
I think I fell in love 
I thought you were the one 
Stop actin' like this 
'Cause you know I need your love 
This time won't be nothing like the last one
Smoking so much gas, I forgot to put my mask on 
Nails razor sharp, called you off my iPhone
Let me hold my hair for you while you put my ice on
This time won't be nothing like the last one
Smoking so much gas, I forgot to put my mask on 
Nails razor sharp, called you off my iPhone
Let me hold my hair for you while you put my ice on

You couldn't get in, so you outside standin’
I could stand still but my diamonds still dancin'
He a hood nigga but I make him a romantic
I'ma go and get the money like I am a addict
Before I went and got a safe, I put it in my attic
Hell nah
I ain't classy, more like sassy
Smokin' out the bowl like the bitch named Sandy
Taste like candy, hands like Randy
I-I-I-I'm original, that's why these bitches can't stand me
All these rap niggas be like, "Damn! Where my song at?"
Catch me in the room, I’m smokin’ gas, where the fog at
Two-tone, mix-match, they like, "Where you get that?"
You niggas some pussies, lemme show you where my dogs at
Fuckin' on yo bitch, gotta tell me where her walls at
He gave me his number, but he know I ain’t gon' call back
Fall back, if you got a problem we can solve that
We do this often, wake you up like coffee in the mornin'
Money on residuals, so when I sleep it's comin’ in
I just hopped in the coupe and dropped the top
Even though it was thuderin'
High off acid! Alice in Wonderland
I'ma always go get the ball when you bitches fumble it
Hell nah!
I ain't classy, more like sassy
Smokin' out the bowl like the bitch named Sandy
Taste like candy, hands like Randy
I-I-I-I'm original, that's why these bitches can't stand me

Smokin' out the bowl like the bitch named Sandy

I was told to get how you live
Oh, for real?
I coulda got her hit, I let her live
Oh, for real? Oh, for real? 
Yeah
I was taught to feel how I feel, keep it real
Diamonds wet, they shockin' bitches, neckpiece like an eel
Niggas said I'm actin' different since I got a deal
I just think I'm eatin' different, more food for the meal
No more Happy Meals, just champagne cheers
I used to not have fans, now I fill up fields
Bought a new housе, but I need me a buildin'
I can't stop until I'm makin' me a billion
No Amine, wе reel in
Any bitches fishin' and seekin' out for attention
Geekin' in the mentions
Please don't make me have to smack a bitch
Ooh, I been itchin' 
Oh, for real?
They said Rico put a ten piece in her grill

Oh, for real?
I coulda got her hit, I let her live
Oh, for real? Oh, for real? 
Yeah
I'm making money smoothies, blend it up, I'm steady mixin'
Like I got the ball, go to the mall and they steady blitzing
They wanting pictures and they wanna know just how I'm living
What I make a show vs. you is a big digit difference
I do the same thing that you do, it's just with me, they feel it
Oh, you mad that you can't hurt my pockets or my feelings?
When I ask you what the issue is, you hard of hearing
I been sinnin' lately, but I'm still God-fearing
Oh, for real?
They said Rico put a ten piece in her grill
I been movin' how I want, fuck how you feel
I was told to get how you live
Oh, for real?
I coulda got her hit, I let her live
Oh, for real? Oh, for real? 
YeahYeah, Rico! Rico!
Oh my fucking god
Whenever I don't get my way, bitch, I get real belligerent
Have a pot to piss in, and now I'm pissing on 'em and they sick
I need a doctor visit, tell me doctor, am I really sick?
He said I'm showin' characteristics of bein' a snobby bitch
Yeah I'm a poppin' bitch, and I know it ain't hard for you to see
I used to watch TV, now I'm the bitch you seein' on TV
I pray to god that my thousands can turn into some millions
And to some billions, that's just my everyday feeling
They keep on asking how I'm feeling
But shit, how would you feel?
When everybody else is hungry and you servin' the meals
I'm grippin' the wheel, I'm praying that I don't get a ticket
Even if you movin' fast, the chance could still come and you'll miss it
Apply it and risk it, 'cause everyday ain't promised a visit
How you expect to learn anything when you talk more than listen?
Or bark more than Bitten?
They keep on sendin' shots but they missing
I invite bitches to my hotel room, and I got 'em kissing
Getting money, the objective of all of my daily missions
Everybody got a problem with me, but I just don't get it
I can't even go nowhere no more, 'cause they want a picture
If money made out of lemonade, then I need me a pitcher
Smoking on some gold papers, bitch, it shine when you hit it
You can't get me out my character, 'cause I'm 'bout my business
I'm wit' a white bitch, she snort more shit then Bobby and Whitney
They don't like to hear the moves I make, 'cause they stuck in a pivot
They took the sauce and yeah, I want it back, does that make me stingy?
They call me weird 'cause I don't look like none of these other bitches
They can't stand to see me win, they cringe when they see my picture
I already know I'm realer, and you don't even know the difference
All my shit original and I don't ever need a witness
When I'm talking money, you say what you say, 'cause you can't comprehend it
Listenin' to Aretha Franklin, thumbing through some Benjamins
I mixed the molly with the Percocets, sounds like an even blend
Bitches wanna swag surf, 'cause they see I set the trends
"Rico, what that bag worth?" Bitch, you better not ask again
Gettin' on my damn nerves, I might swerve in the Benz
Bitches act like birds in the coupe I be in
Better snatch your girl when the troops walkin' in
So much smoke in the air, you think Snoop up in here
I got purple and I got that shit with fuzzy orange haze
For every bitch that's hating, I'ma put one in the airHey, you there?
Aren't you tired of the same old thing?
At every day, every minute, every second
Everybody, everything?
Kenny
It be the same thing, just on a different day
This ain't no bud, this shit ain't gon' fade away
No, it won't fade away, shots like a fade-away
Smile in a hater's face, watch what the fuck you say
I got some crazy ways, do it like Simon says
Look at my diamonds dance, born in a lion's den
If you ain't got it, then why you be lyin' then?
Don't do no arguin', we do the opposite
Niggas go crazy, got hands like an octopus
Niggas ain't stoppin' us, bitches be watchin' and clockin' us
She wanna be me, it's obvious, we pulling up in them Tonka trucks
You be steady driving Impalas, bumblebees all on my collar
Is my name Lonzo? I'm ballin', ballin'
Let me know, give me a holla, put on a show, no Apollo
Clap it up on me like brothel, I'm busy, please don't bother
Make more money than your father, can't get to me, why bother?
I just left from the Bahamas, my money keep getting longer
Walk in, I smell like marijuana
She can try but she don't compete 
When I pull up, you know it's me 
Ain't none of these bitches cold as me 
Cross you just like a rosary 
Sauced up, I got a bowl on me 
These VVS's, these ain't see-through 
You talkin' tough then you get beat 
Fuck a cop, you copped a plea 
None of these bitches cold as me, me, me
I swear none of these bitches cold as me, me, me 
None of these bitches cold as me, me, me
I swear ain't none of these bitches cold as me, me
Riding in a Maserati, like Scotty I'm with two hotties
I ain't just walk in the party, I brought the drugs to the party
Weed smell like somebody farted, I finish that shit and start it
A push to start, it be my car, because my car is always foreign
If I got the ball, I'm scorin', new car and the engine roarin'
Make it rain, it started pourin', I feel so fly, I started soarin'
Don't cost us whenever I'm tourin', these bitches basic and borin'
Tryna keep up but you can't afford it, my ego big, I'm so important
She can try but she don't compete 
When I pull up, you know it's me 
Ain't none of these bitches cold as me 
Cross you just like a rosary 
Sauced up, I got a bowl on me 
These VVS's, these ain't see-through

This money in a Gucci clip, you know that I don't ever trip
Just got back from another trip, no acrobat, I make it flip
Bitch, I got a family, everybody gotta eat
So keep that shit in mind when you thinkin' about tryin' me
I know what I'm doin', you ain't gotta keep an eye on me
I be countin' money like how they be countin' calories
I got her mad at me, 21, make twenty thousand a show
That's your salary, smokin' green like celery
You can't get the best of me, these white people invest in me
You know I got the recipe
Worst nightmare and your biggest fuckin' enemy
If you feelin' like a boss bitch, go'n
Go to the club, leave that nigga at home
If you got your own shit, you ain't ever gotta listen to him, girl

Niggas be hatin' on bitches
I'm the one with the sauce and that's so easy to see
I got 'em in the house wonderin' how it's easy for me
I went from one bedroom apartments in the trenches
To wakin' up and it's Versace all on my pillows, I just don't get it
Just got a quarter-million dollar check, I work like I get it
I just got my first crib, it's stainless steel in the kitchen
I be playing with them bags even though that it ain't Christmas
I'm just speakin' straight facts and I hope that you listen
I'm like a star in the sky, they wishin' on me to finish
I knew the money would come to me 'cause my palms kept on itchin'
I knew that bitches would run from me when I pulled up on bitches
But it's okay 'cause I know the game and I played my position
If you feelin' like a boss bitch, go'n
Go to the club, leave that nigga at home
If you got your own shit, you ain't ever gotta listen to him, girl

Ridin' in a new all-black Mercedes 
Eyes real low so my vision too hazy
Put a button on your soul like it's Driving Miss Daisy

I can never be typical
Don't come out the house unless I'm wearin' something whimsical
From where I made it out, they lookin' at me like a miracle 
Don't say shit you don't mean 'cause I'm literal
If you put your money up to mine, your money miniature
Game over, wasted, finish it, rub it in your face if you ain't listenin'
Diamonds on me wet, I'm like a fisherman
I do the shit you can't do with no middleman
People keep sayin' that I'm rude, I don't give a shit
Stop comparin' me to bitches that I'm better than
Rico goin' hard again, go ahead and tell a friend
I be the tension all in the room like an elephant
Walk up in the club and make it rain like the weatherman
Money layin' everywhere, I ain't ever playin' fair
You don't wanna take it there, she told me to go to hell
I told her, "I'll see you there," life was a nightmare
Turned into a fairy tale, five-star hotel
No more motel, eatin' on oxtail
Bitches on my coattail, singin' to the money like I was Adele

Time is precious, that's the only thing I try not to waste 
She hatin' 'cause I'm up, you can tell on her face

Squad, squad
Gang, gangWoah, Kenny
I'm the best at being me, a lot of y'all can't relate
The only thing I care about is if it's food on my plate
Every time I hit the stage it be a sold-out date
Remember back when I used to sit in line and wait
Now it's mine I take, every time they hate
Man, these people don't know shit about the time it take
Try to box me in, I don't need no oxygen
You could leave me to die, I was born to win
You just gotta love yourself
Don't worry about what everyone is doing or did
You think you're down but you could get left
Don't worry about where everyone is going or been
I done did some fucked up shit in the past but I know that the Lord forgive
I remember dark nights, I would pray to God and he granted my every wish
Yeah, I might sell out but I ain't no sellout
The kids stay around even though the doors let out
Had a lot of built-up anger that I had to let out
Lost a few friends, me and money never fell out
Yeah, I might sell out but I ain't no sellout
The kids stay around even though the doors let out
Had a lot of built-up anger that I had to let out
Lost a few friends, me and money never fell out
The expression of anger is a form of rejuvenation
I'm screaming inside of my head in hopes that I'm easing the pain
Memories in my brain, thinkin' I'm going insane
Everyone knowing my name but somehow I'm feeling the same
Yeah, I might sell out but I ain't no sellout
The kids stay around even though the doors let out
'Cause they just want to tell me about how I helped them out
I won't let them down
You guys are so strong and you don't even know it
People hate you 'cause you're different and focused
People hated me so I flipped it
And turned my emotions to something y'all could sing to
'Cause some of y'all have been through the same shit I've been through
So listen when I tell you
Don't ever buy the dreams that these niggas try to sell you
Don't ever try to bite the same hand that fed you
Everything I did is for the moment that it led to
Yeah, I might sell out but I ain't no sellout
The kids stay around even though the doors let out
Had a lot of built-up anger that I had to let out
Lost a few friends, me and money never fell out
Yeah, I might sell out but I ain't no sellout
The kids stay around even though the doors let out
Had a lot of built-up anger that I had to let out
Lost a few friends, me and money never fell out
Yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, woah
Haha
Do you feel better now?

If you don't get the bigger picture, then you need to crop it
Beefing on the internet, in person, wanna squash it
Riding in a spaceship, going fast like a rocket
Every time I post a picture, they make me the trending topic
They hate me then they love me and it ain't no way to stop it
Some people say I'm ugly and some people say I'm gorgeous
I know that I am stubborn, cause my sign is a Taurus
Hot just like the summer and my money is enormous
Smoking Key Lime OG, I got green like a forest
It must be a bummer, know you wanna come and join us
I don't wanna listen to your problems, cause they aren't important

I am so unbothered, somewhere swimming in the tropics
I don't want your negativity or energy, it's toxic
You wanna be around me, and then turn around and gossip
Make sure that you be careful, cause somebody's always watching
You'll be surprised what people do when they ain't got no options

Pull up and we let ‘em go, take a leap Geronimo

I be gettin' money, now everybody my relative
Talkin' bout, "It's all love," like I don't know what jealousy is
Extra, extra, read all about it
Walk up in the club and I'm dressed so stylish
What is this, a skating rink? 'Cause these bitches childish
I just bought a new Beamer truck, it came with no mileage
I be stylin', look what I'm ridin' in
I don't do no hidin'
Higher than a bitch that's addicted to skydivin'
One hater, two hater, three, watch all 'em pilin'
Walk up in the bank and I'm smilin'
Chain full of diamonds
Just hopped off a boat and I landed on an island
You too short, can't reach my height
I hit you from a long range, damn, they sniped you
We don't do no plain janes, everything icy
Got it on lock so that's why they don't like me 
Big like sumos, boss like Hugo
Ain't no point in askin' what it cost 'cause you know
Number one like uno, kick your ass like judo
Dogs fuck around and bite your ass like Cujo
And you know, Rico

Y'all talk it over, go huddle
Put words together like it's Ruzzle
My jewelry dripping like a puddle
I can survive in the jungle
My shooter keep jacking my lumber

I don't have a choice, I gotta run it up
I got me a little change but it's just not enough
Thought I fell in love but I found out that it was lust
I felt like something was missing, it must have been trust
Don't like to talk about growing up, because I had it rough
But you know good and well I'm not the one to put your pity on
Everywhere I go, I put my motherfuckin' city on 
I be high, I be gone, I be right, I be wrong
But I did it all on my own, you dig?
Might take a few steps, feel like I'm taking back six
I just woke up to a check, you dig?
Let me take a deep breath, I ain't going broke again
I did it all on my own, you dig?
Might take a few steps, feel like I'm taking back six
I just woke up to a check, you dig?
Let me take a deep breath, I ain't going broke again
Sometimes I get distracted by madness
Why do tragedies happen? What if I'm not adapting?
Friends posting pictures, I'm like where was I when this happened?
People looking at me funny, it's like money's the magnet
It's like I'm doing magic, the way I flip it and bag it
Shit might go wrong, I don't panic
I know I got some bad habits, but who doesn't?
No discussion, I ain't bluffing, I do this shit like it's nothing
Put my all into something, yeah, I came up from nothing
But I did it all on my own, you dig?
Might take a few steps, feel like I'm taking back six
I just woke up to a check, you dig?
Let me take a deep breath, I ain't going broke again
I did it all on my own, you dig?
Might take a few steps, feel like I'm taking back six
I just woke up to a check, you dig?
Let me take a deep breath, I ain't going broke again

It could never be us, it could never be we

I don't check the price when I purchase
I'll never be scared of no person
Don't make me make you meet some doctors and nurses

I don't wanna be on the ground when the time flies
Had so many friends goin', "Wonder when it's my time"
I live every day like I'll die by the nighttime
It took me so long gettin' back to my right mind
Five days straight, no rest, oh well
Eyeball a bitch, don't need no scale
I've been on my shit, I don't need no help
Always gettin' money, rain, snow, sleet, hail
Keep it on me 'cause my name ring bells
People see me and can't help themselves
Bitches see me and undress themselves
I wouldn't wanna be anybody else
I never used to think I'd be on magazine covers
They keep on trying to find new ways to push my buttons
I came out of the jungle where it rain and it thunder
But I bring the heat like the summer
I don't wanna be on the ground when the time flies

Every day I work my ass off, I don't get to take off
The haters get flipped off, I'm ready like lift-off
I've never been nowhere, but I'm ready to stay gone
Nothing ever lasts long, I'm always beating the odds
Takin' all these trips, I had to go and get a passport
I'm just tryna live, I don't know what these bitches mad for
I just signed a deal and got a really big back porch
You still at your mama crib, ain't getting money, you gotta ask for it
I got tired of complaining, I got up and changed my situation
Lookin' at the view outside, I thought I would never make it
Every day, these bitches hate but that don't stop the money-makin'
If you want it, go and take it, ain't no point in hesitatin'
I don't wanna be on the ground when the time flies
Had so many friends goin', "Wonder when it's my time"
I live every day like I'll die by the nighttime
It took me so long gettin' back to my right mind

He tap me on my shoulders, I said, "Yeah, I like that" 
This pussy don't purr, this pussy'll bite back
And that woo so good, I sound like his hype man
Now that woo got me doing all the nasty things I said I wouldn't do

Said he wanna take it to the room, let's go

They treat my style like a family-size meal , they just sit around and bite 
I used to live with the roaches , now my neighbors either dumb rich or damn white 
If you wanna get what you want in life, then you gotta kill or you gotta fight 
If you my bitch then I'm with you , I don't give a fuck if you wrong or right
Niggas switchin' over figures that thеy ain't even touch yet, swеar I'll never get it

Foot on they neck, I won't ever let up 
Foot on the gas , I stomp on the pedal

I need a house full of windows, you drive by, you can see this shit
Oh, lookie here, the richest bitch, who would've envisioned it?

Call me crazy, but you can never call me broke 
I put that fly shit on and post it, now they takin' notes 
Either way it go, we coast to coast and rolling dope

My life is a movie with thoughts on my side
And I got hella' niggas cause I'm hella' fly
My mama be tripping, she say that I bang
But I got hella' grass, look out for the snakes
They plotting on me, they smile in my face
But niggas be trying, can't keep up the pace
I roll with the blunt, my eyes feel the haze
You bitches spark me, you feeling the shame?
I'm loving a bitch
She go by the name of Mary JaneI thought you got all you came for
Lover, lover
Kicking up doubt when it's sore
Going to be covered in dark
You came all this way for a door, watching others break it down
Now I see what you came for, lover
All or nothing aren't the same score
Now I'm pouring my sorrows in a bottle
And I don't even drink
The tree won't drown this pain so pour that poison till I sink
I can build us a home and fort, I box it and close the sheets
And once we done announcing our hate, we fucking and fall asleep
But I don't fuck with you and you know that
No obsession down your touch
But you got my love and you know that
Fall in heaven, drama, lust
Plus your lips the root of all evil
The Garden of Eden is needing a slut
And once you all done playing in the grass
You look at your body in sick disgust
Searching for it, got it, never saw it
Searching for a love that conquers all
Tripping off the tree while I'm up from that broad
Damn I got your body numb just in case you ever fall
White pedal flower, yellow scented on you
Buffalo  on you
Fuck the past, I'll shoot it
Fuck the distance, I'll shoot it
Fuck the future, I'll shoot it
Let's just listen to 
Get high and lost in the music
See I don't love you, I'll prove it
Put the gun to my temple
And if you hate me then shoot it
Shut her down
Going to take you outside
Sifting up a reason from the lonely
When it’s over you’ll be golden
Over, over
Shut her down
Going to take you outside
Sucking up the dust from your static, crown
Just the time away, and you'll be golden
Over, over
I think you got all you came for
Do you want more?
Easy is over done, over done
Now I do not know what I want
But I do know what I need
You're the only one I see
Please don't believe what I tweet
I keep making you mad
But you keep playing with me
My emotions too devoted, couldn't quit we a team
I hate you then I love you
We argue then we cuddle
Them other bitches mad but I don't care because I got you
And baby you got me
You touching on my body
We smoke then we chill
I was high now I'm falling
I take the gun
You call my bluff cause I can't pull that trigger
You took my heart
I took your mind and now we're both finished
Feelings diminished
We wasted time and lost trust
And no we're forced to move on
Cause we found out our love was lust
You can't fall, you can't fall, lover-lover
Easiest way to free fall into the lap of another
I think you got all you came for
Do you want more?
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easiest way to free fall into the lap of another
Easiest way to free fall into the lap of another
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is overdone, overdoneIt's the end of my tape

Designer on, I'm classy
People always talking but they do not know the facts and ay
I'm just sitting here laughing
Cause money keep on stacking
And it's funny how you stretching your last dollars like elastic
I'm a real bitch and I do real shit
You got clout for being an actor all morning in the met
Nigga tryna give me sex, I ain't replying to his text
Cutting thirsty niggas off and I ain't talking, I'm , ay
I ain't know what they saying bout me
But I bet that they won't at me first
Make 'em drive off like a motherfucking taxi

I will overpower you
Take over your cells, nigga I will devour you
Smoking Cali weed, he's so fucking to the cool
You can't be mad at me cause I ain't really into you
So tell me what the lick read tonight
Tryna grab a few bottles and probably fade the fight
You wanna take me on trips, saying fade the flight
You wanna find me hella  tryna lay the price
But my mind is on the money
Plus it's kinda funny
Cause my girl said that he lacking
I mean that he not even packing
No protection his hip, he ain't busting shit
Popping off slick, got the lips, what you call this?
A pussy suburban nigga
With two parents who probably love that nigga
Spending money that thing is funny nigga
Fake trap buy me sweet, that is some honey niggas
Fake trap buy me sweet, that is some honey niggas

Screaming I got guala but can't match me a trey
Your pockets ain't on top but your shit say ondelay
So get the fuck out my face, get money or go away
I don't spark up no nigga if you don't put up out my face
Plus it's sad to say
That I seen you flexing with your mama's shit
 pulls up on you quick
Only had a thick this year but you call a fry
You ain't bongo boy, you got blue balls
And your phone ain't getting no calls
Press pause, oh God
He's so fucking beautiful he whispers in my ear
But I'm just tryna watch this movie dude
Pockets on the move
Don't you understand? I can't lose
I'm just come in two's, I maneuver through this shit
You said you was bout it but you ain't nothing but a bitch

Verse:
Eazy Mack:
She's my old bitch, Ray J and Kim K
I hit it first like, Ray J and Kim K
No wait, I hit it first like Amber and Kanye
All these hoes on me, just like Flava Flav
They just want my time, put the clock right in their face
Red seats, white rims, blue benz
United States but it's a foreign
Vlone Eazy Mack bitch I stay with my friends
Its the New Wave these old heads can't swim
Outro:
Eazy Mack:
Ahh Rico these old heads can't swimYeah, Rico! Rico! Oh my god
Whenever I don't get my way, bitch I get real beligerent
Have a pot to piss in, now I'm pissin on 'em, and it sick
I need a doctor visit, tell me doctor am I really sick?
He said I'm showin' characteristics of being a snobby bitch
Yeah I'm a poppin' bitch and I know it ain't hard for you to see
I used to watch TV, now I'm the bitch you seein' on TV
I pray to God that my thousands can turn into some millions, then to some billions
That's just my everyday feelin', they keep on askin' how I'm feelin'
How would you feel, when everybody else is hungry and you servin' the meals
I'm grippin' the wheel
I'm prayin' that I don't get a ticket, even if you movin' fast, bitchass just come and you miss it
I'm plottin' and riskin', 'cus everyday I promise to visit
How you expect to learn anything when you talk more than listen
No bum would’ve bitten, they keep on sendin' shots but they missin'
I invite bitches to my hotel room and I got 'em kissin'
Gettin' money be objective, be all of my daily missions
Everybody got a problem wit' me, but I just don't get it
I can't even go no way no more, 'cus they want a picture
If money made outta lemonade, then I need me a pitcher
Smokin' on some gold papers, but it shine when you hit it
You can't get me out my character, 'cus I'm 'bout my business
I'm with a white bitch, she sell more shit than Bobby and Whitney
They don’t like to hear the moves I make, cause they’re stuck in a pivot
Yeah they took the sauce, and I want it back, does that make me stingy?
They call me weird cus I don't look like none these other bitches
They can't stand to see me win, they cringe when they see my picture
I already know I'm realer, and you don't even know the difference
All my shit original, and I don't ever need a witness
I'm talkin money!
You say what you say 'cus you can't comprehend it
Listenin' to Aretha Franklin thumbin' through some benjamins
I mixed the molly with the percocets, sound like an even plan
Bitches wanna swag surf, 'cus they see I set the trends
"Rico, what that bag worth?," bitch you better not ask again
Gettin' on my damn nerves, I might swerve in the Benz
Bitches act like birds, in the coupe, I be in
Better snatch yo girl, when the troops walkin' in
So much smoke in the air, you think Snoop up in here
I got purple and I got that shit with fuzzy orange hairs
For every bitch I seein', Imma put one in the airYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cool and I'm pretty
I'm so undercover
Got Whitney no Bobby
My molly is pink
But fuck what you think
Wearing a mink
Just to go to the motherfucking store
Whore some motherfucking more
Raunchy bitches at my door
Screaming fake it till you make it
Bitch you fucking, I can't take it
Stop pretending, stop relating to my shit
You ain't never hit no lick
You ain't never smoke a nina
You can't sit with us type shit
You a basic wanna be, yeah
And I ain't throwing shades though
I'm COOL like my wrist
Yeah I know, pockets on Adele, can't shoot slow
Bitch I'm eating
I don't gotta introduce myself
They be like "it's nice to meet you"
Like "you look so cute in person, like can I get a feature?"
And then I'm like no way
Then she's like OMG
Then I'm like okay
Then she's like selfie
Then I'm like bitch I'm not fronting
Do I fucking know you? Do I fucking know you?
I'm the shadiest bitch, yeah I'm the craziest bitch
Got this shit on my hip so please do not play with me bitch
I'm the shadiest bitch, I'm the craziest bitch
That you'll ever fucking meet
Leave your body in the street
Please don't ever fuck with me
I'm the shadiest bitch, I'm the craziest bitch
Why you hate on me bitch?
You know I got money it's blatantly here
Please do not play with me bitch
Please do not play with me bitch
I'm the shadiest bitch, I'm the shadiest bitch
You mad you cannot fuck with my cliqueHe want me to
Yeah, he want me to

He want me to be his girl
He know I'ma rock his world
He want me to be his girl
He know I'ma rock his world
He want me to be his girl
He know I'ma rock his world
I do not fuck with no small fries
Your niggas be sendin' me heart eyes
Had to snatch that boy up, now he's mine
He got his own, don't need mine
I look good with no makeup - check that
And I look even better naked - bet that
I'm hoppin' off and on a plane, I got jetlag
When I touch down, baby, where the neck at?
I'm just waitin' on that where you at text, man
I'm always greater, I can never be less than
He like it when I get on top
And ride him like a Harley, Harley
I could buy me Fendi and Chanel
Since all these bitches watching
I get to the bag but in the bedroom, I'm lil naughty
He want me to be his girl
He know I'ma rock his world
He want me to be his girl
He know I'ma rock his world
He want me to be his girl
He know I'ma rock his world
He want me to be his girl

Time I thought of vacations
Welcome to my triumphs
Times I thought I wouldn't make itI wasn't somebody that they'd wanna know
Now I'm somebody that everyone know
I got a lot of brand new shit that I got on my own
I knew that I was destined

They played checkers while I played chess
So impressive
Get the message
Goals expensive
They mad that they haven't did shit
The way y'all actin'
Why are niggas actin'?
Ooh, I'm sassy
Quite fuckin' nasty
I did it, admit it

You backed out, I didn't
I cashed out, I'm winnin'
I did it, admit it
I hit it, I hit it
You backed out, I didn't
I cashed out, I'm winnin'
Got it out the gutter, got it out the gutter
Got it out thе ghetto

Did it for the better
I did it, I did it
I made it, admit it
I cashed out, I'm winnin'
