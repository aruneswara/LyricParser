Sussmeier This is what happens when you spend a lot more time thinking about the particulars, as opposed to thinking about the generals. It ruins your persistence of vision. So much so that we, like rabbits with eyes diametrically opposed on either side of their heads, have this habit of being able to see better behind themselves. It makes them better at running away at things that wanna prey on them. And that's why I wound up in the county hospital. I descended all the way down to the bottom of hell. I ran into some people that I've never wanted to see before. But my old friend, Norma, she said, "Jimmy, you know being around you is like living in Russia."This is your Uncle Jim speakin' fellas
Nothing in this world is free
You fellas smoke pot?
Your Cousin Jim smokes pot
Yeah he sits around the house
Smokes a little pot
Drinks a little beer
Plays a little music
But he smokes the good stuff, fellas
Not that stuff laced with LSD
‘cause it will drive you out of your mind!
That’s right, don’t buy any pot in Georgetown, fellas
They’re all undercover narcotics agents guys
And that rest area over there on the Parkway?
It's a hangout for three dollar bills
The young crowd hangs out there, guys, the young crowd
I know where the CIA is
It's out in McLean, where you have those high rents
There's acreage out there, the CIA, they've got the gate
I've seen it, fellas, I know where it is
And then Abdullah's Pizza? It's owned by Palestinians fellas
Have you got an aquarium? Is it stocked?
Here, here’s thirty dollars fellas
Go out and buy some seahorses and stock it for your Uncle Jim
I believe in capital punishment, fellas
I’ll kill all those crooks in the capital
In fact, all those insurance salesmen, mafia leaders, congressmen
Let’s throw ‘em in an arena and release some bulls on ‘em, fellas
Cause I’m your Uncle Jim. nothing in this word is for free
Now yer Uncle Jim’s gonna spew a little garbage on ya, fellasI wear them around the house
And around the grounds
They look real good
I keep them shined just like I should
They have cracks of style
They make their own sun
Like some lost god of all the one
My black weather shoes
My black weather shoes
They love the ground and they love me tooI am black
I wanna was a good day
Whoa, I just wanna eat?
Kanye West samples, are you a truck?The pale fox with the poker face
He fucked his mother and fell from grace
He performed the act with such great haste
And defied the order of the natural race
The foxes aim is to be free
From the formal conditions of reality
Though his family has no pedigree
Yet to them the restrictive frame of time is free
No longer are there days of old
Now all his actions seem to be foretold
To a higher order he appeals
And this is the way the future is revealed
Now it appears to be absurd
How the word called "time" is only important when it's heard
Maybe the concept should be banned
Because it is only understood by man
The fox finds truth in a shadowy realm
With an antithetical method that time won't tell
Freed from time and its restrictions
He sifts through lies and contradictions
He destroys the language; gives it a cleaning
And removes the association between words and meaning
He apprehends the truth, removes its disguise
And separates the symbol from the symbolized
Lift the curtain; lower the boom
I can't seem to find a pair of pants that rhymes
Maybe it sounds unorthodox
But you might do well by thinking like a fox
Whoa, meaning seems so deceiving
When you rely on advice from an analyst's call
First you fly, now you're grasping, not feeling
Then you sputter and float then you choke and you'd stumble and fall
A bird at night was singin' along
Singing' till the Balinesian dawn
He crooned and crooned with a feathery smirk
And now let's listen to what he liked to chirp
Whoa, the old hunchback with Maureen O'Hara
Her raven trusses flowing in the air
Well she finally did just what she oughta
So he spoke right up and said "She gave me water"
Now I'm a guy who likes to rhyme
I sang "I knew a jew named Frankenstein"
But now I sing a little different thing
Based on a song by Oscar Hammerstein
Raise the curtain; lower the boom
I can't seem to find a pair of pants that rhymes
Maybe it sounds unorthodox
But you might do well by thinking like a fox          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        Llorando se fue, y me dejó solo sin su amor
Llorando se fue, y me dejó solo sin su amor
Sólo estará, recordando tan buen amor
Que un día no supo cuidar
La recuerdo hoy y en mi pecho no existe el rencor
La recuerdo hoy y en mi pecho no existe el rencor
Llorando estará, recordando el amor
Que un día no supo cuidar
Llorando se fue, y me dejó solo sin su amor
Llorando se fue, y me dejó solo sin su amor
Sólo estará, recordando tan buen amor
Que un día no supo cuidarIt's you. It's the burning nerve ending magic trick
It's you. It's the burning nerve ending magic trick!
It's you. It's the burning nerve ending magic trick! 
It's you! It's the burning nerve ending magic trick. I really think it's you! 
It's a perfect cube. It's you 
It's the burning nerve ending magic trick 
It's you. It's the burning nerve ending magic trick
It's you. It's you! It's time for you! 
IT'S THE BURNING NERVE ENDING MAGIC TRICK!
It's you. It's the burning nerve ending magic trick
It's the demons crawling underneath the skin
That could be the sound of someone slowly peeling the band-aids off the blisters that formed from masturbating too long underneath an ultraviolet sun lamp
It's you. It's fucking you. It's the burning nerve  ending magic trick. 
Ha ha! It's you. It's the burning nerve ending magic trick
The infernal frolic of life doesn't reside in my sperm anymore
It tastes like two meat aspirins
It's the sound of one car crashing
It's the drum with the blood on it  with our ovaries 
The mortally wounded!
It's the sense of drama that occurs during those rare moments when one becomes conscious of the absurdity their lives represent
The burning nerve ending magic trick! The burning nerve ending magic trick! 
It's you. It's burned and blessed. It's the burning nerve ending magic trick. 
It's you!I'm the inventor of the burning pillow fight, so step up, boys, and give me a light, in the matches' red glare, feathers burning in air, to the mattresses far below. We studied evil with Paganini. And I've got a nice red violin with strings made from the dried bowels of the dead wife I murdered with a hammer over twenty-three years ago. So come on, boys, and light your cigars with hundred-dollar bills 'cause where we're going you won't need them anymore and prepare to pay me, the fiddler, with your own life because the one you're living isn't good enough. You'll be released from the shackles of the calendrical year because time is only a sewer pipe through which boredom flows slowly. "Hello, who is it?....Oh, another music critic?...well, why don't you just crawl up my ass and spit nickels." So instead of sucking on Satan's anus all the way up the ladder of success, do something for yourselves for a change and join me as we climb the ladder of the great stack of death masks piled one atop the other all the way to the lighter heaven known as multi-messiah land. Alive is fearful, yet it's sweet. Immortal beings suck our meat. All we are in this form is just a vat of warm flesh and pure fat continually collapsing into itselves and with lit firecrackers taped onto its side, nervously twitching in a semi-lucid state only partially aware of our own joy and pain. And in one of our more thoughtful moments, we invite all of the human race to the Brooklyn Bridge to all hold hands together and then jump off. And so if you ever wondered what Bob Mitchum would look like with a Joan Crawford mask on while engaged to infinity, look at me, the fiddler, as I revoke the law of gravity and perform the final marriage between heaven and earthThank you, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Lake Bologna School of Hair Drying. As you can see, we students are busy hoeing the fields and breeding the ground with the seed of the great sperm whale. But don't let this simple illusion fool you; life up here in Tibet is never what it used to be. Our students here at the identity crisis correspondence school are busy concentrating on the effects of time without duration. So join us now as we careen through eternity in the Niña, the Ford Pinto, and the riverboat Natchez and climb on our broom as we spread our message of dread and uncertainty from high atop the golden radio antennas of the Kremlin, straight through to the heart of the Lincoln Administration. Like a cholera epidemic from the Sahara Desert to the valleys far below, join us now as we sweep through the Milky Way, then join Art Linkletter wearing an Indian headdress in a whorehouse on Old McDonald's Farm with Fats Navarro in 1923. And if you've got an extra seed or two to sew, you can teach the native women how to sing "E-I-E-I-O" as you're swallowing your pet rooster's head with pickle relish. So don't get left behind in the crowd. Take a tip from me, your old Dutch Uncle Suzy, and join us as we prepare to pay the fiddler...Nasty but Classy
Birking bag me
Spending couple of thousands on my titties
Get My teeth done, cash help meThat's right fellas it's your Uncle Jim speakin'
You know it's a most difficult task to drink from my flask
I'll plant you like a seed
You're not in my league
Alright, I'll explain this, y'see?
I slaughtered souls back in China
Y'know, while the widows sang "My Clementina?”
I hacked away at limbs with a machete down those crowded streets of J. Paul Getty, guys
I bottled brain in Rhodesia ‘cause those goddamn British awoke with amnesia
I could spit blood on your family and still win an Oscar or a Grammy, guys
Yeah, I led a team of twelve oxen movin' poisonous toxins
Down the rivers of chromium, runnin' live plutonium
Yeah, I played drums with Napoleon
And I was a librarian at Alexandria, guys
I sold some stolen marsupials with a three-headed possum to a gardener from Zurich
One of those guys known for cultivating illegal blossoms
Yeah, I rolled dice on the vests of dead presidents' chests
With the money I won I purchased six Gatlin guns, GUYS
I flew in the force with Pazuzu and ceremonies of voodoo
Pistol-whipped a federale and dumped him in the trunk of a Masarati, you know
I tip-toed through the tulips, knee-high in Kentucky horse corpses, sippin' mint juleps
That's right, there's me, and you're not
But you know, a badly perfumed woman has no future
I bet you didn't know that
Just be careful -- you wouldn't wanna get your dick cut off in public, now would ya?
I know you wouldn't choose to get beheaded in front of the three million dollars sittin' there at the altar
Gettin' the shit kicked out of you by your girlfiend around all your cronies
You better go into training, since you're not respected at all by the ones who really matter
You can't even hum along with any of the tunes, you know, so how can you play 'em?
That's right
That's right, you're not in my league, guys
Just accept itI'm the inventor of the burning pillow fight, so step up, boys, and give me a light, in the matches' red glare, feathers burning in air, to the mattresses far below.

So don't get left behind in the crowd. Take a tip from me, your old Dutch Uncle Suzy, and join us as we prepare to pay the fiddlerA man is an insect is a flame
And god is the old man to blame
But just cause he's older
He appears to be bolder
But me and the man are the same
Yeah!
A man is an insect is a flame
He's hot and he's rotten and lame
He's an old cardboard soldier
From a red can of Folgers
And a pancake will tell you the same
Yeah!
A man is an insect is a flame
And the same is the same is the same
For breakfast, lunch, and dinner
He's an unlucky sinner
And no one will tell you his name
The water won't go down the drain
It looks like we've had too much rain
So the fire's gone out
And the termites will pout
As the berets slowly float down the Seine
Yeah!
A man is an insect is a flame
And the twin babies' parents are to blame
For the parents up and left
And the babies punched each other to death
For a stork is a vulture is a crane
For a man is an insect is a flame...Nasty but Classy
Birking bag me
Spending couple of thousands on my titties
Get My teeth done, cash help meThat's right fellas it's your Uncle Jim speakin'
You know it's a most difficult task to drink from my flask
I'll plant you like a seed
You're not in my league
Alright, I'll explain this, y'see?
I slaughtered souls back in China
Y'know, while the widows sang "My Clementina?”
I hacked away at limbs with a machete down those crowded streets of J. Paul Getty, guys
I bottled brain in Rhodesia ‘cause those goddamn British awoke with amnesia
I could spit blood on your family and still win an Oscar or a Grammy, guys
Yeah, I led a team of twelve oxen movin' poisonous toxins
Down the rivers of chromium, runnin' live plutonium
Yeah, I played drums with Napoleon
And I was a librarian at Alexandria, guys
I sold some stolen marsupials with a three-headed possum to a gardener from Zurich
One of those guys known for cultivating illegal blossoms
Yeah, I rolled dice on the vests of dead presidents' chests
With the money I won I purchased six Gatlin guns, GUYS
I flew in the force with Pazuzu and ceremonies of voodoo
Pistol-whipped a federale and dumped him in the trunk of a Masarati, you know
I tip-toed through the tulips, knee-high in Kentucky horse corpses, sippin' mint juleps
That's right, there's me, and you're not
But you know, a badly perfumed woman has no future
I bet you didn't know that
Just be careful -- you wouldn't wanna get your dick cut off in public, now would ya?
I know you wouldn't choose to get beheaded in front of the three million dollars sittin' there at the altar
Gettin' the shit kicked out of you by your girlfiend around all your cronies
You better go into training, since you're not respected at all by the ones who really matter
You can't even hum along with any of the tunes, you know, so how can you play 'em?
That's right
That's right, you're not in my league, guys
Just accept it
