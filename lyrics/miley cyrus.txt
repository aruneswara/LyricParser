I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free, as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true in MalibuWe clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you win
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should've let you win
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck meIt's our party, we can do what we want

Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own 
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes 
Forever and ever, no more 
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds 
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you 
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you

That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no

La, la, la-la, la
She got her hair pulled back 'cause the sweat's drippin' off of her face 
Said, "It ain't so bad if I wanna make a couple mistakes"
You should know right now that I never stay put in one place
Forever and ever, no more 
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds

Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go
I want my house in the hills
Don't want the whiskey and pills
I don't give up easily
But I don't think I'm down
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights

Baby, we were found, but now we're lost

Boy, I adore you

Of men armed with weapons
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
I love lying next to you
I could do this for eternity, you and me

With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess 
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like, "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town"
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Feel like hopping on a flight 
Back to my hometown tonight 
Something stops me every time 
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright
So I put my hands up
They're playing my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah 
Movin' my hips like, yeah 
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
They know I'm gonna be okay 
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
So I put my hands up
They're playing my song, the butterflies fly away 
I'm noddin' my head like, 'yeah' 
Movin' my hips like, 'yeah' 
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
They know I'm gonna be okay 
Yeah , it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah , it's a party in the U.S.A. I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
"You'll never reach it"
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost, with no direction
My faith is shaken
But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb
The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments that I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going
And I, I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on, 'cause...
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes you're gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb
Keep on moving
Keep climbing
Keep the faith, baby
It's all about, it's all about the climb
Keep your faith, keep your faith
Woah-u-ohOh, you broke my heart
I told you I was weak for love
But then you went around
And did what you wanted to do
And now I'm cryin', cryin'
Ooh, it seemed like everything was going fine
I found the love that I thought was gonna last
But then I accidentally saw a few things in your cell
I even LOL'd
Man, I should've known
Why? Why you're doing what you do?
You, you might as well just tell the honest truth
See, I'm not really down with this
This ain't no texting shit
No, I ain't got no biz, but it is what it is
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name
I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
SMH
I'm pressing "send" on you
Could've been this, could've been that
We done been there, we done been back
You ain't with it, could've said that
Why you tripping?
Let me hit that
I ain't trying to argue no more
I do it all for you
You know you're my ride or die, baby, let me show you
Oh, I know what's been goin' on
Don't even try to act like Mr. Super Nonchalant
What makes you think I'll stick around?
I'm not as stupid as you sound
And you sound really dumb right now
From A to Zed, ooh-ah
I got a lot of nasty things floating up in my head
But none of them are worth my time
You're not even worth this rhyme
And I don't, I don't give a flying
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name
I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"
'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"

 Letters for you
What you trippin' on?
Girl, you know you wrong
Don't let these girls drive you crazy, haan
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name
I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you
One of them's "F" and the other one's "U"

It's fine 'cause I'm in the mood
Hope you don't mind if I spike it
We'll drink it, just me and you
And you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be sleeping on a red-eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night
And we're just gettin' started
Always last to leave the party
Drugs rule everything around me
Wake up with new tattoos on my body
Drugs rule everything around me
Hit the Goose, raise a toast, pop the molly
I can go toe-to-toe, like I'm Ali
We're all tryna fill the lonely
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
These planes are all UFOs
And this city's in outer space
It's better than where we came from
I think that we both should stay
'Cause you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be fucking on a red-eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night
And we're just gettin' started
Always last to leave the party
Drugs rule everything around me
Wake up with new tattoos on my body
Drugs rule everything around me
Hit the ghost, raise a toast, pop the molly
All the girls in my room look like Dolly
We're all tryna fill the lonely
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me

Hello
The sunny place for shady people
A crowded room where nobody goes
You can be whoever you wanna be here
And oh, I've been livin' at the Chateau
Shouldn't drive, but I should really go home
I don't even know 'em, but they won't leave here
Frightened by my own reflection
Desperate for a new connection
Pull you in, but don't you get too close
Love you now, but not tomorrow
Wrong to steal, but not to borrow
Pull you in, but don't you get too close
I've been California dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleedin'
Keep me up all night 
Keep me up all night 
Lost in black hole conversation
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night 
Keep me up all night
I just wanna feel 
I just wanna feel somethin' 
But I keep feeling nothin' all night long
All night long
All night long
All night long
Hello 
I'll tell you all the people I know 
Sell you somethin' that you already own 
I can be whoever you want me to be
Love me now, but not tomorrow
Fill me up, but leave me hollow
Pull me in, but don't you get too close 
I've been California dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleedin'
Keep me up all night 
Keep me up all night 
Lost in black hole conversations
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night 
Keep me up all night
I just wanna feel 
I just wanna feel somethin' 
But I keep feelin' nothin' all night long
All night long
All night long
All night long
All night long
I've been California dreamin' 
Plastic hearts are bleedin' 
Keep me up all night 
Keep me up all night 
Lost in black hole conversations
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night 
Keep me up all night
I just wanna feel 
I just wanna feel somethin' 
But I keep feelin' nothin' all night longFeels like I just woke up
Like all this time I've been asleep
Even though it's not who I am
I'm not afraid of who I used to be
No one stays the same 
You know what goes up must come down 
Change is a thing you can count on 
I feel so much younger now 
Feels like I've been living in a dream
But never make it to the end
My eyes open when they feel the light
It's always right before I'm about to scream
No one stays the same 
You know what goes up must come down 
Change is a thing you can count on 
I feel so much younger now 
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down 
No one stays the same 
You know what goes comes back around 
Change is a thing you can count on 
I feel so much younger now 
I feel so much younger now 
I feel so much younger nowI'm writing down my dreams, all I'd like to see
Starting with the bees or else they're gonna die
There will be no trees or air for us to breathe
I start feeling mad, but then I feel inspired
Thinkin' about the days
Coming home with dirty feet from playing with my dad
All day in the creek
He somehow has a way of knowing what to say
So when I'm feeling sad, he makes me feel inspired
We are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up to change
I know it sounds so strange
To think we are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up the change
I know that sounds so strange
Because you always felt so small, but know you aren't at all
And I hope you feel inspired
Oh, I hope you feel inspired
How can we escape all the fear and all the hate?
Is anyone watching us down here?
Death is life, it's not a curse
Reminds us of time and what it's worth
To make the most out of it while we're here
We are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up to change
I know it sounds so strange
We are meant for more
There's a lock upon the door, but we hold the key to change
But how can we escape all the fear and all the hate?
Is anyone watching us down here?Bangerz... fuckin' bangerz
Bangerz... fuck-fuck-fuckin' bangerz!
All the way in the back with a tree on my lap
All the boys like to ask me, "What you doing with that?"
Yeah, yeah
You say you love me, I ain't fooling with that
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack
One day he wants me
One day he wants me not
I don't do chances, 'cause time just ain't what I got
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at
I can't be sittin' 'round here waiting for a man to tell me where the fuck my seat be at
Where Mike WiLL at?

I'm flying high up on the bird; acrophobiac
I slick, caught her eyeing down my purse
Where the dollars at?
I let her know the rent's due on the first
They can call the hearse
'Cause, if there's any violation, I go off with that
Catwalk, slick talk, flirting with a big dog
You know I'm on that "meow", quick to scratch your eyes out
Strutting on the court, make them nervous, call a timeout

Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning 
'Cause I don't wanna leave home, without your love
Without it
You told me that you wanted this
I told you it was all yours
If you're done with it, then what'd you say forever for?
If forever's out the door
I'll ignore when you call
Drive my heart into the night 
You could drop the keys off in the morning 
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
Without it
You told me you were coming back, right back
You promised it was real, and I believed that
But if I fall for it again, I will be a fool
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you? Yeah
But I guess I got no valentine
Send me roses, I'll just let 'em die
I was crazy thinking you were mine
It was all just a lie
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't wanna leave home  without your love
Without it
I always knew I never wanted this
I never thought it could happen 
You acted like you wanted this
But then you led me on 
I thought you would be there when I go 
You promised you would be there when I go 
But all broken promises, I won't miss, I'm finished
All I know are the facts
That when I look you in the eyes, all I see are the lies
Been there, done that
Drive my heart into the night 
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love
Without itAlright, so this is really fucked up, but
Alright, I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude
And then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did just made me cringe and it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall back right out again
This whole time, I could give to you and I could paint you pictures but I guess I could just never write a song and then maybe I'd never fell out of love with him in the first place
I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling cause my energy's just so strong that, I don't know if I'm creating this or this is actually what is meant to be
And you know that, they say that you gotta think what you want into existence, but you know, I haven't been too good at making decisions so, I have no idea what the fuck I want, I guess
You're giving me a feeling in my head
Laying in my bed just thinking
Not really feeling like the one I want
Takes everything in me not to call him
I really, really, really want it, too
I told all my friends I'm moving on
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking
You know what, in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies and shit and then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby goo-goo tongue down my fucking throat
I mean, even in front of your mom
Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough
I mean, you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch
You know, like, I hate all that fucking PDA, I probably hate it more than your fucking friends do
You know, it's sweet and you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead but, you know I just, I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo
You keep saying again and again
We're laying in my bed just talking
And now I, now I can't hold it back
I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit
I don't really wanna let go of you
I heard I change my mind way too often
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking
Alright, so, I'm gonna be honest
It's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here
I mean, I'm fucking what?
Look, I like when you send me, you know, the, the queen emoji, but when I send back the monkey, you know, the ones with the, the hands over the eyes? That means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me
I mean, I don't wanna say it in person, I just bury my head in your armpit which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth
Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do
And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute...
Well, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world
You know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to someone giving a fuck
I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit
I mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
I don't really wanna get over you
I heard I change my mind way too often
Baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talkingMmm, mmm, mmm
Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name, only "baby"
The more that you give, the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me
I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la
I'm everything they said I would be
I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you
Tonight, mama says you don't look happy
Close your eyes
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me
I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
Oh, ah, ah

Ah, oh
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave

How many times have I left you in the deep?
I don't know why you still believe in me
Oh, and even in my darkest days, even in my lowest place
You love me the most
And even when I can't stay, even when I run away
You love me the most
So why do I hurt you so? Is it 'cause I know?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, the most
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I know? Is it 'cause you love me the most?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the most
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I know? Yeah
Your tender touch is the healing that I seek
I come to you when my judgement becomes weak
All that you are is all I ever need
I don't know why you still believe in me
Oh, and even in my darkest days, even in my lowest place
You love me the most
And even when I can't stay, even when I run away
You love me the most
So why do I hurt you so? Is it 'cause I know?

YeahIf you're looking for love, know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity, well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else
I used to believe love conquers all
'Cause that's what's seen in movies
Come to find out it's not like that at all
You see, real life's much different
I don't wanna see you go
I only wanna see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile
I can't stand to see us there
We cried, we lied
Cannot pretend to take us back to what we had
To make us feel alive again
Hold me close
Don't let me go
I hope
Tell me now is not the end
If you're looking for love, know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity, well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else 
I've turned into someone else
I used to believe love conquers all
'Cause that's what I felt when you held me
I thought you'd catch me if I fall
And fill me up when I'm empty
I don't wanna see you go
I only wanna see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile
I can't stand to see us there
We cried, we lied
Cannot pretend to take us back to what we had
To make us feel alive again
Hold me close
Don't let me go
I hope
Tell me now is not the end
If you're looking for love, know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart

BabyChapter one; we started happy
The second that you said you loved me
Started questioning us
Are we really in love?
Tryna figure out chapter three
But you're not giving me anything
If this is what we are, then I gotta move on
You think this is everything, but this is no book of love
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right
Here comes the part of you and me
Arguing about nothing
You tell me it's as good as it gets
Yeah, I'm real emotional
Blame it on your mental jokes
How much did you think that I could take?
So much for taking this too far
You can't blame me for who I am
It's too late for us to try to be in love right now
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right
Fill the pages now, this chapter's done
Moving on up and forward onto all that will become
If you ever get to the place where the sun is shining every day
Then I'll be on your mind
You might think I'm crazy 
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy

'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
It's twelve o'clock and I don't wanna party
My big boyfriend and my big truck hobby
A little bit of dirt never hurt nobody
Now I got dirt all over my body
Might as well lie to L
His big fog lights is bright as hell
Calls it off, he starts to yell
He hits the gas so I grab the rail
Sure you wanna ride with me?
If you scared, don't lie to me
I'm a crazy motherfucker from the Midwest
With a Mississippi flow and an Arch rest
Four by four with the altar steps
We doing donuts underneath the arch, yes!
I need a chick on time, don't mind being early
A ride-or-die, dollar six thirty
A straight-up chick like twelve o'clock
"I don't know where he at", that's what she tell the cops
Take a stand for a nigga, raise a hand for a nigga
"I solemnly swear he was with me all day"
To the judge, "he the one I love"
Hell they could tell, she don't even budge
'Round and 'round we go
Don't stop 'til I tell you so
I'm in that passenger seat, flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we plumb out of gas, let's go
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go

Sometimes the best you've ever had
Sometimes I need your lovin'
Sometimes I stab you in the back
I found a meanin'
Just what I needed
Cut on the bathroom wall 
Midnight reflection
Cravin' attention
Under the disco ball
Night crawlin', sky fallin'
Gotta listen when the Devil's callin'
Can't shake it, I'll taste it
When it's yellin' out my name, I chase it
Come on, come on
Night crawlin'
Come on, come on
Night crawlin'
Sometimes my thoughts are violent 
Sometimes they bring me to the light
Sometimes I sit in silence 
Sometimes I'm running for my life
I found the meaning 
Just what I needed 
Cut on the bathroom wall
In my reflection 
Cravin' attention
Under the disco ball 
Night crawlin', sky fallin'
Gotta listen when the Devil's callin' 
Can't shake it, I'll taste it
When it's yellin' out my name, I chase it

Night crawlin'

Night crawlin'
Come onI'm not tryna have another conversation
Probably not gon' wanna play me on your station
Pourin' out a bottle full of my frustration
Here to tell you somethin' that you don't know
I'm the type to drive a pickup through your mansion
I'm completely naked but I'm makin' it fashion
Maybe gettin' married just to cause a distraction
Here to tell you somethin' that you don't know
Am I wrong that I moved on and I
And I don't even miss you?
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go
What the fuck do I know? I'm alone
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology? Not from me
Had to leave you in your own misery
So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on?
And I, and I don't even miss you
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go, what the fuck do I know? 
Tryin' to see the stars through the new pollution
Think that I'm the problem? Honey, I'm the solution
Maybe all the chaos is for your amusement
Here to tell you somethin' that you don't know
Put you on a pedestal, you're cravin' the spotlight
Desperate for attention, nose is bloody, it's daylight
Wakin' up with people that we met for the first time
Loved it, then I hated it, and I let you go
What the fuck do I know? I'm alone
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology? Not from me
I had to leave you in your own misery
So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on?
And I, and I don't even miss you
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go, what the fuck do I know?
What?
What the fuck do I know?  I'm alone 
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology?  Not from me 
I had to leave you in your own misery
So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on?
And I, and I don't even miss you
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go, what the fuck do I know?I probably shouldn't say this, but at times, I get so scared
When I think about the previous relationship we shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standin' in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear
The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you, oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you
It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear 
Oh, I'm not comin' back
You're taking seven steps here
The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you
And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention the seven that I like
The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined, everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you
You do, oh
Ooh, ooh 
Ooh, oohI wanna start by saying thank you
I'm gonna miss ya, honey
You gave me things I can’t buy back with money
You changed my life
You've been my world
There's no other girl that looks like ya, darling
Those eyes, that tongue, those teeth, that face, that body
Even though we’ve gone to outer space
Still no way you can take his place
You're not him 
Yeah, she's not him
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I just can't fall in love with you
'Cause you're not him 
Yeah, she's not him
And why, why can't I love you, baby?
Like I wanna love you, baby
I’m sorry
And maybe it’s beyond my control
Some sort of chemical reaction
Making it impossible to let him go
You're not him
She’s not him
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I just can't fall in love with you
'Cause you're not him
Yeah, she’s not him
And you don't deserve
All the bullshit I've put you through
And you, you deserve
A heart much bigger than one that's torn in two
Oh, oh
You're not him 
She's not him
Every time you walk through my door
I swear to God you're more beautiful than before
But you're not him
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I just can't fall in love with you
'Cause you're not him
Yeah, she's not himHow can I love someone I never touched?
You lived under the water, but I love you so much
You never been on land, and you never seen the sky
You don't know what a cloud is
Why does everything I love have to die?
They all wanted to see you be as big as you could be
But I couldn't let that be
By keeping you small, by keeping you safe
If I could do it again, I'd release you to sea
'Cause I can't bear to see something so wild just die in a tank
And Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so much
And Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so bad
On Saturday night, we all went out to eat
But I can never decide, so someone chose sushi
I got soup, and I ordered rice
But watching my friends eat my friends, ruined my appetite
Oh, Pablow the blowfish
If they only knew you like I do
They'd love you too
And Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so bad
I won't forget, even one second we had
'Cause you might be gone, but you could never be dead
I heard of a seahorse named Sadie
I heard she was quite the lady
Maybe you'll find her and you could make babies
That'd be kind of crazy
If Pablow the blowfish
Found love deep in the sea
Then that would mean
Pablow the blowfish
Is better off than here with me
But Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so badI'm sure that you know where I stand
Lead me on, do it while you still can
Party up the street, even though there is no place to park
Party up the street, and you know what happens after dark
You can see our feet from the street
Since the garage was halfway open
Our eyes didn't meet until we started rollin'
Party up the street, even though there is no place to park
Party up the street, and you know what happens after dark
The way that you movin' your body, I want money
Soon as I put it on you, you wanna guard me
We didn't come this close for nothing
We didn't come this far for nothing
Party up the street, even though there is no place to park
Party up the street, and you know what happens after dark
You can count on me, okay
You and me, we can be okay
We can rock like an ocean wave
You and me, we can be okay
We can go out with a bang
Party up the street
Party up the street
Party up the street
Party up the street
And you know what happens after dark
And you know what happens after dark
And you know what happens after dark
Yeah yeah
And you know what happens after dark
And you know what happens after dark
And you know what happens after darkThey say love can drive ya crazy, my dear
I wanna trap you in a locket, or in my pocket
So I can keep you near
You know I'd never hurt you
If you fall, I’d pick you up and I'd drink your tears
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?
They say good things come to those who wait
It’s like countin' in light years
I'd physically live without you, but I don't want to
And death's never been my fear
You can take my blood, take my bones
My heart is yours, I volunteer
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?
When you look up at a rainbow
Do you ever wonder what's really waiting at the end?
I don't want no gold, nothing’s more than you
The amount is hard to even comprehend
Nothing I can do, I lost control
Something we hold on to so dear
But how can I miss you so much when you’re right here?
And how at this optimal time did you just appear?
Everyone under their guard, so full of shit
But you are just so sheer
You're my God, you’re my faith
On my knees, I look at you and I revere
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?
When you look up at the cosmos
Do you ever wonder if there's really even an end?
It might go on forever, like my love for you
An amount that's hard to even comprehend
I won’t waste my time with wonder, in apprehension, or livin' life in fear
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?
You're my God, you're my faith
On my knees, I look at you and I revere
You can take my blood, take my bones
My heart is yours, I volunteer
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?You tucked me in, turned out the light
Kept me safe and sound at night
Little girls depend on things like that
Brushed my teeth and combed my hair
Had to drive me everywhere
You were always there when I looked back
You had to do it all alone
Make a living, make a home
Must have been as hard as it could been
And when I couldn't sleep at night
Scared things wouldn't turn out right
You would hold my hand and sing to me
Caterpillar in the tree
How you wonder who you'll be
Can't go far, but you can always dream
Wish you may, and wish you might
Don't you worry, hold on tight
I promise you there will come a day
Butterfly fly away
Butterfly fly away 
Got your wings, now you can't stay
Take those dreams and make them all come true
Butterfly fly away 
You've been waiting for this day
All along you've known just what to do
Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly, butterfly fly away
Butterfly fly away
Butterfly fly awayI sleep with the door open if you want to come in while I'm sleeping
I'm always sleeping naked, 'cause you wake up and you're creeping
Want to lick it so much that it's almost like I taste it on the tip of my tongue
I want to touch it so bad that it's almost like I can feel it on my fingertips
I want yours inside of me, but don't forget where I like licking, babe
I want to make your fantasies realities I want to be your's, babe
I want you to bang my box
I want you to bang my box
There ain't nothing I'm scared to try
I can be on top, or if you like it I just lie here
Take my picture
Position my body wherever you like
Just know I like it naughty
Teach me a lesson, pretend we never met
But we can keep just kissing, 'cause you're getting me so wet
The only downside to this morning is you getting up and you leaving
When I'm dreaming and you're in 'em I wake myself up, 'cause I'm screaming
Uh-huh, what are you doing to me?
It's like you're a zookeeper setting animals free
You release me like a tiger that's been locked in a cage
Here I am, here you are
I want it so hard
You finger my heart
And I know just what I need
What I came here to do
What I've been thinking, babe, been most about you
I want you to bang my box
I want you to bang my box
You say it tastes like cake with my lips against your face
Want you to eat it, babeI had a dream Davie Bowie taught us how to skateboard
But he was shaped like Gumby
And I had a dream we took a helicopter
Flew it up too high, got stuck in the clouds
Don't wanna come down
And I had a dream
We went on a safari
I said, "Look at that lion, she reminds me of you 'cause you're the queen."
And I had a dream that you were dying
But I wasn't even crying
I just sang you to sleep, I sang you to sleep
But what does it mean?
What does it all mean?
Oh, I had a dream
What did it mean?
What did it mean?
And I had a dream we robbed the record store
The one with the yellow door
We stole every goddamn record they had
And I had a dream that I didn't give a fuck
But I give a fuck
I miss you so bad, I think I might die
What does it mean?
What does it all mean?
I had a dream
But, what did it mean?
What did it mean?
I just wanna scream
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
I just wanna scream
I just wanna scream
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
I had a dream
But what does it mean?
What does it mean?
I had a dream
But what does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it all mean, mean?
And I had a dream we were being chased by a monster
Or maybe they were aliens
But I wasn't scared 'cause you were there
And I had a dream we took karate
That's when you said you loved me
You loved me
What does it mean?
What does it all mean?
What does it mean?
What does it all mean?
Fuck yeahYou are everything to me
And I, I would die for you
There've been times where I'm up all night
Crying in the dark, so I sleep with the light on
I've heard I've got words like a knife
That I don't know how to choose just so wisely
But I see trees and their colored leaves
When I think about all that we could be
When you're gone, time moves so slow
Like the grass, I've watched us grow
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow
How could I never let you know?
That you are everything to me
You're sweeter than candy and better than any childhood dreams
I am yours and you are mine
I have your heart, I don't even need a ring
I'd give up all I have in exchange for who I love more than anything
When you're gone, time moves so slow
Like the grass, I've watched us grow
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow
How could I ever let you know?
'Cause you, you're everything to me
And I, I would die for you
Yeah, I would die for you
When you're gone time, moves so slow 
Like the grass, I've watched us grow 
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow 
How could I never let you know?
I would die for youUh 
Uh 
You may think I'm ghostin', but the truth is I'm a liar
I sell you what I tell you, but you ain't a fucking buyer
You thinkin' that I'm sleepin' when I'm creepin' in the night
They say it's bad karma when you live a double life
They say it's bad karma being such a heartbreaker
I've always picked a giver 'cause I've always been the taker
I'd rather just do it, then I'll think about it later, uh-huh
Kiss me, bad karma, uh 
Uh 
The itsy bitsy spider went and spun a web of lies
I don't play the nicest, but it ain't a fucking crime
I never learn my lesson so I always do it twice
They say it's bad karma when you live a double life
Oh, they say it's bad karma being such a heartbreaker
I've always picked a giver 'cause I've always been the taker
I'd rather just do it, then I'll think about it later, uh-huh
Kiss me, bad karma, uh 
Uh 
I don't give a fuck, I don't believe in luck
That's why I do what I wanna do, yeah 
Oh, I don't give a fuck, I don't believe in luck
I do what I wanna do, oh, hey 
They say it's bad karma being such a heartbreaker
I've always picked a giver 'cause I've always been the taker
I'd rather just do it, then I'll think about it later, uh-huh
Kiss me bad karma, uh 
Uh 
Uh 
Uh 
Uh
You got a mean drummer face
Just like, "Argh"If I spent a week without you
Bet you'd wonder what I’d do
I think that I'd start goin' out
Get caught kissin’ other dudes
And it seems you just wanna bring me down, down
With your bad attitude 
When you know I'm not one to keep dealin' with the shit
That you put me through
I know that I gave you my heart
But you stomped it to the ground
And that's what's got me wondering what it's like
To not have you around
If I spent a week without you, hmm
I'd probably have so much fun 
First things first I'd gather up all my girls, yeah
So we can lay out in the sun
Oh, it’d be so nice not to worry, yeah
How I’d love not to stress
I'd go and grab my old blue jeans
I’m sick of wearing this silly dress
I know that I gave you my heart
But you stomped it to the ground
And that's what's got me wondering what it's like
To not have you around
You know I’d miss you, babe
Feels like I've known you since I was just 7 years old
You used to make me smile, but now you don't do that anymore
It feels like I'm always just crying and sleeping alone
But when I think of you gone
I know
I know that I gave you my heart
But you stomped it to the ground
I don't want to wonder what it's like
To not have you around
To not have you around, to not have you around
To not have you around, to not have you around
You know I'd miss you, babe
You know I'd miss you, babe
You know I'd miss you, babeMidnight and the moon is out
Careful, you might hurt yourself
Pleasure leads to pain
To me, they're both the same
Sweat drippin' down to the floor
Bite marks like an animal
You might be insane
But maybe we're the same
Tonight you came here
'Cause you know what I need
And no one likes to be alone
I don't need a future, I don't need your past
I just need a lover
So gimme what I want or I'll give it to my
Self-inflicted torture, you don't have to ask
I just need a lover
So gimme what I want or I'll give it to myself
I can tell that you're new to this
Slow it down, but you can't resist
Beat your fantasy
Give yourself to me
Tonight, you came here
'Cause you know what I need
And no one likes to be alone
I don't need a future, I don't need your past
I just need a lover
So gimme what I want or I'll give it to my
Self-inflicted torture, you don't have to ask
I just need a lover
So gimme what I want or I'll give it to myself
Give it to me, babe 
Give it to me, babe 
Give it to me and nobody else, babe
Give it to me, babe 
Give it to me, babe 
Give it to me and nobody else, babe
Gimme what I want 
Gimme what I want or I'll give it to myselfSometimes I get a little too hurt
Got my mind goin' places it ain't wanna go
Sometimes I get a little too low
And I can't see myself through the fire and smoke
And you, like a neon light
Shinin' through a door that I can't keep closed
And you, like a rolling stone
Always buildin' cities on the hearts that you broke
And in my head, I did my very best saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you, but I think of you and don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high
Sometimes I stay up all night
'Cause you don't ever talk to me in my dreams
And I think about eventually you're holdin' me
And dancin' to the record like a movie scene
And in my head, I did my very best saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you, but I think of you and don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Sometimes I get a little too hurt
Got my mind goin' places it ain't wanna go
And in my head, I did my very best saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you, but I think of you and don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I still feel highOnce had a love and it was a gas
It soon turned out I had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind
Once had a love and it was divine
I soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind
In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do
Once had a love and it was a gas
It soon turned out I had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone bеhind
Lost inside, adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm thе one you're using, please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruising, yeah
Riding high on love's true bluish light
Once I had a love and it was a gas
It soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behindGo ahead, you can say it's my fault
If it still hurts at all
I thought one of these days you might call
When you were feelin' small
Drownin' in my thoughts
Starin' at the clock
And I know I'm not on your mind
I wonder what would happen if I die
I hope all of my friends get drunk and high
Would it be too hard to say goodbye?
I hope that it's enough to make you cry
Maybe that day, you won't hate me
Go ahead, you can say that I've changed
Just say it to my face
One drink and I'm back to that place 
The memories won't fade 
Drownin' in my thoughts 
Starin' at the clock 
And I know I'm not on your mind
I wonder what would happen if I die
I hope all of my friends get drunk and high
Would it be too hard to say goodbye?
I hope that it's enough to make you cry
Maybe that day , you won't hate me
Wonder what would happen if I die 
I hope all of my friends get drunk and high 
Would it be too hard to say goodbye? 
I hope that it's enough to make you cry
And maybe that day, you won't hate meI got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were somethin' special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again
I've got a way of knowin' when somethin' is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again
I got this crazy feelin' deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader, but I'm reading the signs
That you can't wait to see me again
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again
I got my sights set on you, and I'm ready to aim
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you againSitting here with nothing to say
Looking out the window
It just rained, but the sun's up for the day
And there's probably a rainbow
But I don't care 'cause all the colors left with you
Thinking about driving around in your car
I never thought that we would take it very far
I just love talking, and then parking, then we'd go walking
I loved you so much
I just started watching TV
I get so high 'cause you're not here smoking my weed
And I get so bored 'cause you're not here to make me laugh
You're so cute in your space suit
In your space boots
Space dude
Since you've left, I've started to drink
Sometimes now, when I do drugs I'll start to overthink, and I start crying
I think I'm dying
But I'm just tripping
Start spiraling down this hole
Oh, space dude in your space boots
I got to be high to deal with your moods
But maybe it's me, I got to change my view
Oh, space dude in your space suit
Our love, it takes us to the moon
But you leave me up there, I'm so marooned
Oh, space dude in your space boots and your space suit
Space dude
Space dude in your space boots and your space suit
Space dude
Every time we talk I feel like shit
I guess I was just tryin' to avoid letting myself feel like this
'Cause it makes me feel like I might die
But every second I'm doing that anyway
My biggest fear is not being with you
The pain is so excruciating I don't know what I'd do
We're both vegan
It makes it easy to think you’d never hurt anything
Living intentionally
Oh, space dude in your space boots
I got to be high to deal with your moods
But maybe it's me, I got to change my view
Oh, space dude in your space suit
Our love, it takes us to the moon
But you leave me up there, I'm so marooned
Oh, space dude in your space boots and your space suit
Space dude
Space dude in your space boots and your space suit
Space dudeI woke up in Montecito
I was thinkin' about my life
And the questions made more questions
Starin' out into the night
Yes, I've worn the golden G-string
Put my hand into hellfire
I did it all to make you love me and to feel alive
Oh, that's just the world that we're livin' in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
You dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
There are layers to this body
Primal sex and primal shame
They told me I should cover it
So I went the other way
I was tryin' to own my power
Still I'm tryin' to work it out
And at least it gives the paper somethin' they can write about
And oh, that's just the world that we're livin' in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
And you dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
So the mad man's in the big chair
And his heart's an iron vault
He says "If you can't make ends meet, honey, it must be your fault"
We all focus on the winners
And get blinded by their shine
Maybe caring for each other's just too 1969
But oh, that's just the world that we're livin' in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
And you dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
And I think I'll stay, yeah
I have too much to lose
So I think I'll stay
I can't walk awayEverybody needs inspiration
Everybody needs a song
A beautiful melody
When the night's so long
'Cause there is no guarantee
That this life is easy
Yeah, when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you
When I look at you, I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars hold the moon
Right there where they belong
And I know I'm not alone
Yeah, when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you
You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kaleidoscope colors that
Cover me, all I need
Every breath that I breathe
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you
I look at you
You appear just like a dream
To meIn your bed, or in your car
On the earth, or up in the stars
I wanna be where you are
Even if that means going too far
At your place, or up in space
You can, you can meet me out, as long as I see your face
I wanna be, where you are
Even if that means, letting go of my heart
You take me higher than I’ve been before
Don’t laugh when I say that, 'cause we just smoked a bowl
And I, I have a hard time, anyway, saying how I feel
But I’m a little buzzed, so I’m keeping it real
And I tried to take it slow, but
When you're 'round me, my pot’s about to blow
And everything you do just turns me on
So let’s go to my room, and "na-na"
Shit's 'bout to get real freaky, I can feel it
I hope you're ready, I'm into whatever
Shit's 'bout to get real freaky, I can feel it
Don't you worry, we won't regret it
It's never felt right to be so wrong
I should've called you sooner, you loved me for so long
And it's been a while since I've been with someone else
'Cause I got too good at just doing it myself
At your dad’s place, or at your moms
And if they’re both home, we can go out on the lawn
And I wanna walk around while wearing high heels
After we drank all night, and we done a bunch of pills
And then...

I always wake up in a bad mood
I can never fall asleep
I'm always thinkin’ 'bout you
What life would be if we didn't meet
I always wake up in a bad mood
Open my eyes, then I’m on my feet
And I wonder what you would do, yeah
If you couldn't rely on me
 I wake up in a bad mood
 I wake up in a bad mood
And you know that I got the proof
We're held together just by a string
And while you're hangin' round with your crew
I'm here balancin' too many things
I always wake up in a bad mood
I'm sick of rushin’ straight to the sink
You’re acting like you ain't got the news
I don’t even really care what you think
But what I do, you know I do with love
I believe in more than you can see
And you know I'm never givin' up
I ain't stoppin’ 'til I know I'm free
 Ooh  I wake up in a bad mood
 I wake up in a bad mood
The glass ceiling's gotta break
All together, wanna hear ya say
"I don't know how much more it can take"
You know it's gone on way too long 
And you know it's wrong 
But I know I'm strong 
I don't give up 
And when it gets rough 
I get tough 
I've had enough
 I wake up in a bad mood
  I wake up in a bad mood 
And when the light starts getting dim
I'll open windows up and let it in
Sometimes it feels like it's 'bout to end
Before it's all about to begin
 I wake up in a bad mood
 I wake up in a bad moodI know I do this every time
I walk the line, I play with fire
And I stop myself before the crime
I walk the line, yeah, I play with fire
I don't wanna push you way too much
I don't wanna lean that way too far
I don't wanna ever learn the hard way
But if you're looking for stable, that'll never be me
If you're looking for faithful, that'll never be me
If you're looking for someone to be all that you need
That'll never be me
That'll never be me
Dry your tears now, don't you cry
I'm by your side, at least for a while
I know I do this every time
I walk the line, yeah, I play with fire
I don't wanna push you way too much
I don't wanna lean that way too far
I don't wanna ever learn the hard way, no
I don't wanna keep you in the dark
I don't wanna gamble with your heart
I don't wanna ever leave you lonely
But if you're looking for stable, that'll never be me
If you're looking for faithful, that'll never be me
If you're looking for someone to be all that you need
That'll never be me
That'll never be me
Can't get too close to the sun 
Baby, you're the only one, oh, I
I'd never lie to you, baby, oh 
You give me a reason to run from the fire
'Cause baby, you're the only one
Oh, I swear I'd never lie
If you're looking for stable, that'll never be me
But I hope that I'm able to be all that you need
If you think that I'm someone to give up and leave
That'll never be me, no
If you think that I'm someone to give up and leave
That'll never be me
That'll never be me, no
That'll never be meYou gotta love someone
I don't know what you’ve been told
Or what they say about me
I never give up, but give it a rest
I ain't got time to worry 'bout a mess
And I’m kinda getting tired of dealin' with all your stress
I'm startin' to think you have no heart, yeah
You don't even have a soul
You always give in or ya try too late
All I do is give and all you do is take
I'm tired of protecting you from what you need to know 
Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you weren't the one
But nothing ever stops me from forgetting
Packing all my shit and movin' on
Hey, yeah
I’m not sure I’d even go
'Cause I made your house my home
It’s come to an end, I hate how it's been
Lights are getting dim and the walls are caving in
And it's time for this queen to go and find another throne
When I give it up, I give it all
I went and made you my life
Don't you dare say I don’t care
When I need you most, you know you're never there
It'd be a cold day in hell before I'd ever be your wife, that's right
Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you weren't the one
But nothing ever stops me from forgetting
Packing all my shit and moving on
Kickin' off my shoes and runnin' towards the sun
I said "Nothing's really worth it unless you're having fun"
To make somebody stay
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you weren't the one
But nothing ever stops me from forgetting
Packing all my shit and moving on
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someoneWhen you wake in the morning
And I can tell it’s not your best side
No good morning, good day
I stay to the right if I know you’re mad
And on the left side, stay outta your way
Just hold on
In a minute, it’ll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
 That you go through a lot
 That the pressure makes you hot
 'Cause you still know what you got
 Yeah
 I’m rooting for my baby
 Yeah
If you were here, I’d get your beer and I would hang your coat
You wanna be home
So you roll up your sleeves and you sweat and breathe
This is a long road, so much more to go
Just hold on
In a minute, it’ll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
 That you go through a lot
 That the pressure makes you hot
 'Cause you still know what you got
 Yeah
 I’m rooting for my baby
 Yeah
See I’ve been dreamcatching
I thought that this is everlasting
A life filled with you, me, love, and laughter
Happily ever after
So hold on
In a minute, it’ll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
 That you go through a lot
 That the pressure makes you hot
 'Cause you still know what you got
 Yeah
 I’m rooting for my baby
 Yeah
I’m rooting for you, baby
Yeah
I’m rooting for my baby, yeah
That you go through a lot
The pressure makes you hot
You still know what you got, yeahThe milky, milky
The milky, milky, milky, milk
The milky, milky, milk
The milky, milky, milk
The milky, milky, milk
The purple that is collapsing
Head for the hills and prepare your intellect to flow
The game of life is changing
Man is about to awake
Electric sun beams dancing in a liquid in my skull
The milky, milky, milk
Your tongue licking me so hard
And from sucking on your nipples
Licking milky, milky stars
I feel like a slab of butter
That is melting in the sun
The presence melts away
Now that you and me are one
I made a nilla sundae and the greatest truth appear
That open up the flood tides of the last 2 billion years
I ask myself a question
What the fuck is gone?
But I knew that I knew it from the milky, milky gods
The milky, milky, milk
Your lips get me so wet
While I'm singing all the verses from the Tibetan Book of the Dead
The milky, milky, milk
The milky, milky, milk
Yeah, I'm digging it
It's kind of a molecular thing
Yeah, I'm digging it
It's kind of a molecular thing
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, I'm digging it
I feel like a slab of butter 
Melting in the sun 
The presence melts away 
Now that you and me are one 
Now that you and me are one 
Now that you and me are one
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, yeahThe sunrise insists on gladness
But how can I be glad now my flower is dead
Oh, sun, I see you happy
You made the morning dew
Now you're showing me the truth
I don't want to believe you
The night has the power
To hold all your helplessness in
Heaven
The darkness and sadness
Hold to each other 'til tomorrow
The sunrise insists on gladness
But how can I be glad now my flower is dead
Oh, sun, I see you happy
You made the morning dew
Now you're showing me the truth
I don't want to believe you
Death, take me with you
I don't wanna live without my flower
Tomorrow, tomorrow
The time that it takes for love to effect a person
So deep, so deep
So deep
Oh sun, oh sun
Oh sun, oh sun
Oh sun, oh sun
I see you happy
Oh sun, oh sunHey, Miley
It's me, I’m in Nashville
I'm on my way to Dollywood, busy as you are
Can't get enough stuff to do, can’t
But anyway, I'm excited about singing with you
So I'm just gonna turn my CD player on with you singing
I'm gon' put this on a cassette
Sing along with it, and then I'll run you off a CD later
Oh, I'm so high tech
I got a flip phone too
But anyhow, see what you think
And mmm, here I go
Come on
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where everything goes as planned and I smile
’Cause I know if we tried, we could really make a difference in this world
I won’t give up or sleep a wink
It's the only thought I think
You know where I stand
I believe we can start livin’ in a rainbowland
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand
Oh, I'd be lyin' , if I said this was fine
All the hurt and the hate going on here 
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through
Together we can start livin' in a rainbowland
Living in a rainbowland
Where skies are blue and things are grand
Oh, wouldn't it be nice  to live in paradise
Where we're free to be exactly who we are
Let's all dig down deep inside
Brush the judgment and fear aside
Make wrong things right , and end the fight
'Cause I promise ain't nobody gonna win
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand
Oh, I'd be lyin' , if I said this was fine
All the hurt and the hate going on here 
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through
Together we can start livin' in a rainbowland
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand together 
Change things forever 
I know there's got to be a greater plan
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through 
Together we can start livin' in a rainbowland
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Hey, Miley
Look, I know it sounds scrambled when I'm singing it with you
Wish I could do a little better
At least, I might not get it all the way through
'Cause I'm not sure of the structure without you
But I think this could work well, don't you?
If not, like I said
I'll write that love song for you
You probably wrote it about some boy you loved, didn't ya?
Well...They say love grows, but I've only seen it die
I'm too young to feel like I'm running out of time
I get so scared
Thinking I'll never get over you
I always be making a compromise no matter what I do, ooh
And maybe I'll never get over you
I've heard no one controls what happens in our lives
The universe gets to decide
Our future is written up here in the sky
And I get so scared
Thinking I'll never get over you
Everything I've imagined
And none of our plans coming true
I met someone new, and now I'm scared to go all the way
I hear you in my mind, and can't let go of what you used to say
I'm freakin', it's repeating when you said there'll never be a day
When letting go feels like before, tonight we're trying anyway
And I get so scared
Thinking they'll all be just like you
All the ways that you hurt me
And all of the shit you put me through
But maybe they'll all be just like you
Or maybe, they’ll never come close to you
So maybe, I'll never get over you

Feels like I'm asleep, but I’m awake
In this dream, I never see your face
I'm just a step behind
Hey!
Can't remember why you went away
Pinch me, 'cause I know it's a mistake
I wanna see your eyes
I woke up in another life
Where nothing's really dangerous
And everything is black and white
And no one even knows
I woke up in a broken dream
With no one lying next to me
It's not how it's supposed to be
So why'd you have to go?
I'm still trying to wake up from this
From this nightmare, from this nightmare
Where everything is in its right place
But you're not there
No, you're not there
Hey!
Table's set for two, but it's a waste
I'm the only one that's breaking plates
The quiet's getting loud
Hey!
Everyone keeps saying I'm okay
One more night alone, I'll go insane
I need to hold you now
I woke up in another life
Where nothing's really dangerous
And everything is black and white
And no one even knows
I woke up in a broken dream
With no one lying next to me
It's not how it's supposed to be
So why'd you have to go?
I'm still trying to wake up from this
From this nightmare, from this nightmare
Where everything is in its right place
But you're not there
No, you're not there
Suddenly, I can almost see you
Feel the heat of your breath on my skin
Scared to death that I'm only dreaming
Suddenly, I can see you fading
Going on, but my heart starts racing
Scared to death, 'cause I know I'm dreaming
I'm still trying to wake up from this
From this nightmare, from this nightmare
Where everything is in its right place
But you're not there
No, you're not thereOne, two, three, four
I don't know where you always go
Why you tryin' to keep it on the low?
I'm always like, "Where the hell you been?"
You tell me that you've been hanging with your friends
Somethin' seems just a little sus
We ain't got nothin' if there ain't no trust
I'm not sure, but I got a hunch
And now you've got me thinkin' way too much
I've been thinkin' way too much, much, much, much
You ain't been callin' me enough, 'nough, 'nough, 'nough
Now I'm longin' for your touch, touch, touch, touch
I've been thinkin' way too much, I've been thinkin' way too much
You won't pick up the phone, phone, phone, phone
Now I'm sitting here alone, lone, lone, lone
Do you do this just for fun, fun, fun, fun?
I've been thinkin' way too much, I've been thinkin' way too much
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
It's getting late, I'm starting to obsess
You got me crying and lookin' like a mess
My daddy said, "Stay away from such"
But now you got me thinkin' way too much
I've been thinkin' way too much, much, much, much
You ain't been callin' me enough, 'nough, 'nough, 'nough
Now I'm longin' for your touch, touch, touch, touch
I've been thinkin' way too much, I've been thinkin' way too much
You won't pick up the phone, phone, phone, phone
Now I'm sitting here alone, lone, lone, lone
Do you do this just for fun, fun, fun, fun?
I've been thinkin' way too much, I've been thinkin' way too much
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
All night, all I do is think about you
I've been thinkin' way too much, much, much, much
You ain't been callin' me enough, 'nough, 'nough, 'nough
Now I'm longin' for your touch, touch, touch, touch
I've been thinkin' way too much, I've been thinkin' way too much
You won't pick up the phone, phone, phone, phone
Now I'm sitting here alone, lone, lone, lone
Do you do this just for fun, fun, fun, fun?
I've been thinkin' way too much, I've been thinkin' way too much
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about you
Oh yeah, all I do is think about youSomething in the way you love me
Something in the way you stare
I wanna be there skateboarding
In a space dude's evil lair
Something in the way you fuck me
You're never fucking there
Something in the way you touch me
I wonder, I should care?
Okay, keep that last one
Sleeping makes us optimistic
And we can't live without dreaming
It's the only time we can really be together
But I'm optimistic
There's something giving me that feeling
There's something giving me that feeling
There's something
There's something giving me that feeling
There's somethingThere is freedom within, there is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road while you're traveling with me
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
And we know they won't win
Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me, suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the T.V. page
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
And we know they won't win
Are you a mouse or a bear or a..? Um
Whatever you are it's probably the cutest mouse/bear thing I've ever seen
I'm a unicorn if you can't tell
You're the cutest unicorn in the world
That's fine, we can just go to riff on it
Sorry I was fucking up, I was drifting sorry
I was flirting sorry, sorry I was flirting, sorry
Alright everybody, sorry I'll fuck off, here we go, I'm sorry here
Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
And we know they won't win
Hey now, hey now, don't dream
Hey now, hey now, world, you're an angel Ariana Grande
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey nowWhen we're driving, you're saying "go faster"
And when we're singing to the radio, you're saying "make it louder"
And you roll another one
You wanna get higher
And when I need the fire, you're always my lighter
When we're rolling, you always put your feet on mine
And when I’m running late, you always remind me of the time
When I'm feeling low, you lift me to the moon and back
Back into your arms
I won't let go until I know how much you really love me, baby
I see a light
And I've heard we never truly see ourselves
You gotta leave it up to someone else to know how beautiful you really are, baby
We never get to see ourselves sleeping peacefully next to the ones that we love
We never see us cry, when someone dies, they see us crying
Someone new was born, baby
When we're driving, you're saying "go faster"
And when we're singing to the radio, you're saying "turn it louder"
And you roll another one
You wanna get higher
And when I need the fire, you're always my lighter
I see a light coming towards me
Moving slowly, but coming quickly at the same time
I think it represents what's going on in my mind
When we're together, everything's so sweet
Nowhere in the world I’d rather be
As long as I got you, and you got me, baby
I could leave here
I don’t need nothing but you
You’re starting out beyond just us two
Forever gets complicated, but it don’t have to be that way, baby
I see a light coming towards me
Moving slowly, but coming quickly at the same time
I think it represents what's going on in my mind
What's going on in my mind
I think it represents what's going on in my mind
What's going on in my mind
I think it represents what's going on in my mind
What's going on in my mindI ain't looking at you for no particular reason
It's just a tough spot for me to be in
I gotta open that door
Gotta get it open
I'ma push my way through, just like a robber
And smile for the camera
Damn, that felt awesome
Push it open little more
Gotta get it open
You would never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject, 'cause, 'cause it's beyond you
And when you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up, and do it on my own
Hey
I'll find a way, yeah
And I'll do it on my own
Hey
I can do anything, yeah
And I'll do it on my own
I will get it done with the help from no one
Came into this world by myself
So I don't need nobody else
We have just begun
So much to do, so young
Don't be afraid of alone
You'll get it done on your own
I know you're in there; open up, open up
Just like the Feds looking for the stuff
Three knocks at the door
I gotta get it open
I'm so confused with all the traffic
I'ma skip the line
Who cares what happens
I gotta stay on that course
I gotta get it open
You would never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject, 'cause, 'cause it's beyond you
And when you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up, and do it on my own

Oh, I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your skin is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene
He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene
And you could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can

For those who don't know me, I can get a bit crazy
Have to get my way, yep
24 hours a day, 'cause I'm hot like that
Every guy, everywhere just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection
I always gets a ten, 'cause I'm built like that
I go through guys like money flying out the hands
They try to change me, but they realize they can't
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan
If you're gonna be my man, understand
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed
If there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya
I'm not here to sell ya or tell you to go to hell
I'm not a brat like that
I'm like a puzzle, but all of my pieces are jagged
If you can understand this, we can make some magic
I'm wrong like that
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go
I wanna be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode
Baby, by now you should know
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed
Well, I'm not a trick you play
I'm wired a different way
I'm not a mistake, I'm not a fake, it's set in my DNA
Don't change me, don't change me
Don't change me, don't change me
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go
I wanna to be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode
Baby, by now you should know
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamedI forgive you

It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you
I didn't mean all the shit I said
But it's better than what's going on in my head
How dare you bring another chick in our bed
You’re lucky I’m doing my yoga, or you might be dead
I ain’t doin nothing that could take away my zen
Gave you another chance and then you fucked it up again
Life’s a bunch of tests, and we all just do our best
Searching for something outside ourselves to bring us happiness, yes
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you

It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you
You and I dont know what goes on for us
If we leave it to the stars, we’ll both know what’s aligned for us
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you

It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you
Forgive you, but I'll forget you
I'll forgive youYeah, yeah
Let me see your hands in the air
Yeah, yeah 
I remember dreaming 'bout the things I do right now 
Like I climbed onto a cloud, scared to look back down
I remember when I was all alone 
Nobody 'round to hold me down 
But now, you're here with me tonight
Look at what you found
I was lonely for some time
Now it's only you and I
I won't live without your love tonight, tonight
I'm dancing to the sound of my words in the crowd
Too high to come down
So let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air
It's go hard or go home, and it ain't no looking back
My toughest enemy's in the mirror
Would you look at that?
I'm top five, dead or alive, one of the best to rhyme
And if I ever take a seat, I stood the test of time
Every verse, every song, every feature I was on, better know that I abused it
If I die before my time, I'll still be living through my music
I cracked the industry open, but still got this shit on lock
Even on the highway up to Heaven, Luda still will be on top 
I'm dancing to the sound of my words in the crowd
Too high to come down
So let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
I'm dancing to the sound of my words in the crowd
Too high to come down
So let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the air
Let me see your hands in the airEyes are strange
They say everything while our mouths just try to sing
Singing something
I can never fall forever and ever
So I try to understand it all, but I fail to live it up
I'm still standing here forever without sunshine in my mind
Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar
Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar
There's some kind of love that's so much higher
Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar
I've seen death, I’ve seen truth
I've heard lies, I've seen birth too
I've seen happiness, I've seen pain
I've seen the sun come up and I've kissed the moon
I’ve heard voices through the wall
I've seen figures in my bed
I feel protected by things I don't understand
And that's more than you could say
Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar
Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar
There's some kind of love that's so much higher
Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liarAlright this is really fuckin' fucked up but, but, but
Fucked up, fucked up
Fucked up, fucked up
Fuck, fuck fuck, fucked up
F-F-Fucked upI'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?
Fucked up
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?
Fucked up
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?
Fucked up
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?
Fucked up
The only laws I obey, the ones I'm makin' for myself
So why you make me play on the rules of someone else?
Self control is not something I'm working on
We fuck, you turn me on, is all I can say about you
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the sun
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one
Now that you and me are one
Now that you and me are one
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
Nature made a hole and now it's open full of sweat
Like a scorpion on fire, stinging myself to death
I can’t extinguish what is instinctual
You turn me on, is all I can say about you
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the sun
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the Sun
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one
Now that you and me are one
Now that you and me are one
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me onWe all walk around and waste life
It's just gonna go on forever
Like there's some eternal endless supply of what it takes to keep us alive
There might be a day when everything goes away
To remind us how ungrateful our culture is
We need to take time to replace what's stolen from Mother Nature
We only have 1 sun, 1 moon
1 me, 1 you
And we only have a little time to show how much we love
The sun , the moon 
How much I really love you
And we only have a little bit of time 
I once heard Grace Jones say I have my own concept of time
I always think 'bout that 'cause I've always felt like
I was running a little behind
What's in front of me?
I don't know, 'cause I can't see what hasn't started to grow
We only have 1 sun, 1 moon
1 me, 1 you
And we only have a little time to show how much we love
The sun , the moon 
How much I really love you
And we only have a little bit of time 
Wake up, world
Can't you see the earth is crying?
Wake up, world
Can't you see all the clouds are dying?
And maybe one day there won't be rainbows
Grass won't be green and the sky won't be blue
I don't wanna see a cyclone
There's no sun, no moon
No me, no you
We only have 1 sun, 1 moon
1 me, 1 you
And we only have a little time to show how much we love
The sun , the moon 
How much I really love you
And we only have a little bit of time Sun Gods crest upon his azure shield
Shows you what you know ain’t what you feel
Shooting beam, blinding me
The sun is a giant spaceship tangerine
It shoots out rays of hopeful golden morphine
Tangerine shooting beam
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tangerine shooting beam
As I stand before this holy sphere
It’s singing me a song I don’t want to hear
Want to hear
Uh huh, yeah, yeah, woah
All I see is warm champagne
Confetti on the floor from last night, still laying
The same playlist on my phone, still playing as my eyes strain
Jealous of the sun, wishing I could do the same
Man, but how I’m supposed rise though when shit just hold me down?
How I'm supposed to shine man, through all the smoke and clouds?
I’m on a trip, no luggage, no ticket
I’m looking in the mirror and I’m the only thing missing
I been tryna find myself, I feel so long distance
Made a promise to myself, I wouldn't just be a statistic
No, no, I’m the one of the one on one’s
Twenty some but my soul a hundred some
My mind’s racing, it’s racing
And honestly I can’t remember what it’s running from
I just hope that I come in one
Seems like everyone I know is getting married
Everyone else getting buried
Life should come with a sign saying "results may vary”
Straight up
I take my place along the memory
The sun’s so high, it’s rising in the heat
Try to fight the sunrise but it comes for you
Love is brighter than the fiery violent truthThe first impulse to violence is probably right
The second impulse to stop it is probably wrong
Why do people only show forgiveness when they want to sound cool in a song?
So I keep tryin' to understand where we are goin'
I keep searchin' for some meanin' in my dreams
And I'm dreamin' of bein' eaten by a tiger
While the sparrows start to sing in a tree
And we always end up singin' the same song
They remind us of the cool shit in the world
But they also remind us we are dying
That's why we want to sing even more
I don't think we got where we were goin'
I had a dream that we were in a weird sky
Why do people let their dreams be somethin' so bad?
Such a weird fuckin' dream
Flyin' around into the sky, like superman
Changing tigers and your arrows land sparrows
Those religious fucks will never understand
And we always end up singin' the same song
They remind us of the cool shit in the world
Maybe it wasn't a dream
I can't really tell anymore
And we always end up singin' the same song
'Cause we always end up singin' the same song
Helps us to forget that we were wrong
And we always end up singin' the same song
And we always end up singin' the same song
Helps us to forget that we were wrongWell, it's good to hear your voice
I hope you're doing fine
And if you ever wonder, I'm lonely here tonight
I'm lost here in this moment and time keeps slipping by
And if I could have just one wish, I'd have you by my side
Oh oh, I miss you
Oh oh, I need you
And I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder every day
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will stay
Well, I try to live without you
And tears fall from my eyes
I'm alone and I feel empty
God, I'm torn apart inside
I look up at the stars, hoping you're doing the same
And somehow I feel closer
And I can hear you say
Oh oh, I miss you
Oh oh, I need you
And I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder every day
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will
Stay, always stay
I never wanna lose you
And if I had to, I would choose you
So stay
Please always stay
You're the one that I hold onto
'Cause my heart would stop without you
I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder everyday
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will stay
I'll always stay
And I love you more than I did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask I will stay
I will stay
I will staySanta baby, I hear you've got some presents for me, Miley
I've been an awfully good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa baby, I don't need any fancy jewelry
Not me, I've got something else in mind
Santa baby, and I don't need your presents tonight
Don't want diamonds, cash, or stars
Nothing that comes in a box
No more fluff, I've had enough
And I can buy my own damn stuff
Santa baby, I bought a baller car of my own
My own, I bought it all by myself
Santa baby, with zero help from Elf on a Shelf
Listen Santa to what I say
A girl's best friend is an equal pay
So stop interrupting me when I talk
And don't text me pictures of your... *ringtone*
Santa baby, I'd love to know my ass won't get grabbed at work
By some ignorant jerk
Tell the dirtbag to put away the chimney tonight
Put away the chimney tonight
Just put away your chimney tonight
So put away your chimney tonight
So put away your chimney tonightFa lalalala
This is my sad Christmas song
I've had it stuck in my head all day long
I wrote it in the car on my ride home
Cause I knew I'd walk in the door and I'd be alone
Why'd I even put up that fuckin' tree?
If there's no one here that's gonna see
Just how pretty she looks on Christmas Eve
Cause there's no one here next to me
This is my sad Christmas song
So I light another bong
I turn on the radio
I binge watch our favorite shows
This year feels kind of lame
But the last one was the same
"Where's your holiday spirit?" they say
It's taking off on a plane
This is my sad Christmas song
Fa lalalala
I always thought that Santa was kind of cute
There's something about his beard, big belly, and boots
I left Santa more than cookies this year
I thought he might appreciate a few beers
That's why I'm always on the naughty list
He said cause when I get drunk, I'm always showing my tits
He leaned in for a kiss and he got real near
I had to stop Santa and say "My true love ain't here"
This is my sad Christmas song
So I rip another bong
I never been good at making plans
Next year, I'm gonna be with my man
My little sister says I'm the Grinch
But my mom thinks I'm just a bitch
Why did you have to go?
We were under the mistletoe
This is my sad Christmas song
Fa lalalala
Fa lalala
Missing you on fuckin' Christmas
Why did you have to go?
Wishing you a Merry Christmas
Know I miss you so
Missing you on fuckin' Christmas
Why did you have to go?
Wishing you a Merry Christmas
Know I miss you so
Wishing you a Merry Christmas
(Fa lalalala
Fa lalalala)
Wishing you a Merry Christmas

Wishing you a Merry ChristmasI'm so drunk, I can't even explain what I feel right now

I'm so drunk, I can't even explain what I feel right nowWhen the white flag sails, covered in streaks of blood
There'll be an endless sea, of hands rising up
And the preacher man, and the preacher's son
Will stand arm in arm, just like everyone
We longing to be free, I won't let you fade away
We shared so many dreams, I won't let them fade away
In the hands of love, we carry on
Stronger than we started
The ash and dust that trail behind us
Wicked is the blinded
Who we are comes to life, yeah
Who we are comes to life
When the water spills, the glass will break
It drips like tears, running up your face
And the hounds will cry, for the dogs of war
But the sounds of joy, that victory will soar
We longing to be free, I won't let you fade away
We shared so many dreams, I won't let them fade away
In the hands of love, we carry on
Stronger than we started
The ash and dust that trail behind us
Wicked is the blinded
Who we are comes to life, yeah
Who we are comes to life
We longing to be free, I won't let you fade away
In the hands of love, we carry on
Stronger than we started
The ash and dust that trail behind us
Wicked is the blinded

Creation shows me what to do
I'm dancing on the floor with you
And when you touch my hand
I go crazy, yeah
The music tells me what to feel
I like you now, but is it real?
By the time we say goodnight
I'll know if this is right
And I feel you  pumping through my veins
Am I into you, or is the music to blame?
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?
The room is full but all I see is
The way your eyes just blaze through me
Like fire in the dark
We're like living art
And it hits me like a tidal wave
Are you feeling me, or is the music to blame?
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?
So come on, baby
Keep provoking me
Keep on roping me
Like a rodeo
Baby, pull me close
C'mon, here we go, here we go, here we go
And it hits me like a tidal wave
Are you feeling me, or is the music to blame?
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
You used to call me your angel
Said I was sent straight down from heaven
You'd hold me close in your arms
I loved the way you felt so strong
I never wanted you to leave
I wanted you to stay here, holding me
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go and I need you to know
I miss you
Sha la la la la, I miss you
You used to call me your dreamer
And now I'm living out my dream
Oh, how I wish you could see
Everything that's happening for me
I'm thinking back on the past
It's true that time is flying by too fast
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go and I need you to know
I miss you
Sha la la la la, I miss you
I know you're in a better place, yeah
But I wish that I could see your face, oh
I know you're where you need to be
Even though it's not here with me
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go and I need you to know
I miss you
Sha la la la la
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go and I need you to know
I miss you
Sha la la la la, I miss youEvil is but a shadow that always accompanies the good
You can try to have a world, a world without the shadow
But it will be a dark, dark and hopeless world
'Cause it would be a world, a world without light too
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
The light of nature
The light of the true
The light of silence
The light of all I do
The brigter it shines from the mountain
The more evil hides in its hole
Enjoy soo hard to defeat us
A world starting to lose your control
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
-Trol, lose your control
-Trol, lose your control
-Trol, lose your control
-Trol, lose your control
We won't stop
We'll let it go, it drop
How'd it get to be so obvious?
I'll have fun
We won't stop
We'll let it fucking drop
We won't stop, oh
I'll have fun
Evil is but a shadow
A shadow in this world
Evil is but a shadow

But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own 
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes
Forever and ever, no more 
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds 
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you 
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the whitе winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like shе's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Loved by you
La, la, la-la, la
Midnight
And the days go by like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own, I begin again
I sing to my friend, eh 
Nothing else mattered 
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds 
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you 
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on her mouth, everybody's talkin' now, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white winged dove 
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Falling on, on the edge of
Seventeen
I don't hide blurry eyes like you
Like you
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you 
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, you know
I don't need to be loved by you

In the midnight
You know it's true
In the midnight
Sky What could you hope to achieve when I'm crying and you know why?
How do you find your reasons in my deepest, darkest night?
I keep giving you up
I remember when you were my only friend
Now I'm not sure you can feel like that again
I keep giving you up
And my, you know my mind's made up this time
There's no going back to find what we had
And I know there's no light here left to shine
There's no wrong where there's no right
So enough
I'm giving you up
All the things that you said
Well, you seem to forget
Dance around in my head every night
And there's a battle within that I'll never win
'Cause it's me that I'm up against
It’s my heart versus common sense
Can I give you up?
And my, you know my mind's made up this time
There's no going back to find what we had
And I know there's no light here left to shine
There's no wrong where there's no right
So enough
I'm giving you up
Strip the layers
Make me better
Help me get out clean
Show your colors
I'm slipping under
Help me through this, please
And my, you know my mind's made up this time
There's no going back to find what we had
And I know there's no light here left to shine
There's no wrong where there's no right
So enough
I'm giving you up
Yeah, yeah
My mind's made up
Yeah, yeah
I'm giving you up
I'm giving you up

Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?
But you see, it's not me, it’s not my family
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What’s in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh
Another mother's brеakin'
Heart is takin' over
When thе violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
It's the same old theme, since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What’s in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-aah, ra-ra

ZombieYou don't understand what it is
That makes me tick, but you wish you did
You always second guess
Wonder if I'll say yes
But you just lose out every time
If you only knew what I talked about
When I'm with my friends, just hanging out
Then you'd have the inside scoop on what to say, what to do
That way, when you play the game
Baby, you could never lose
Don't you wish that you could be a
Fly on the wall?
A creepy little, sneaky little
Fly on the wall
All my precious secrets, yeah
You know them all
Don't you wish that you could be a
Fly on the wall?
You'd love to know the things I do
When I'm with my friends, and not with you
You always second guess
Wonder if there's other guys I’m flirting with
You should know by now
If you were my boyfriend, I'd be true to you
If I make a promise, I'm coming through
Don't you wish that you could see me
Every second of the day?
That way you would have no doubt
That, baby, I would never stray
Don't you wish that you could be a
Fly on the wall?
A creepy little, sneaky little
Fly on the wall
All my precious secrets, yeah
You know them all
Don't you wish that you could be a
Fly on the wall?
A little communication
Well, that'll go a long way
You're getting misinformation
Too much hearsay, hearsay
And what I say is
Come a little closer
And what I'm gonna say is
Don't ya?
Don't ya?
Don't ya?
Don't ya wish you were a?
Hey!
Don't you wish that you could be a
Fly on the wall?
A creepy little, sneaky little
Fly on the wall
All my precious secrets, yeah

Fly on the wall?Do me a favor
And tell me what you think about me
Tell me how you want this to be
Go out on a limb and just dream
Paint a picture
Choose your colors extra wise
Especially what you put on my mind
Imagine what it be like to touch the sky, yeah yeah
Whoa-oh, your thoughts are gonna pick me up
Do you know it’s good to feel so much?
Whoa, you got my head in the clouds
Whoa, you got me thinking out loud
The more you dream about me, the more that I believe
That nothing’s ever out of reach
So dream, dream, dream
I breathe your visions
They pull me through the coldest of nights
They steer me towards that moment in time
When you show me what it means for you to be mine, yeah
Whoa, oh you're giving me the will to try
Do you know that there's happy in these eyes?
Whoa, you got my head in the clouds
Whoa, you got me thinking out loud
The more you dream about me, the more that I believe

DreamIt's been in the past for a while
I get a flash, and I smile
Am I crazy?
Still miss you, baby
It was real, it was right
But it burned too hot to survive
All that's left is all these ashes
Where does love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever
After all the time we spent together?
I have to know why I had to lose you
Now, you've just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean
Da-da-do
Da-da-do-do
Da-da-do-do-do-do-do
Da-da-da-do-do-do-do
In a dream, you appeared
For a while, you were here
So I keep sleeping
Just to keep you with me
I'll draw a map, connect the dots
With all the memories that I got
What I'm missing, I'll keep reliving
Where does love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever
After all the time we spent together?
I have to know why I had to lose you
Now you've just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean
This is it
Let go
Breathe
You don't have to love me for me to, baby, ever understand
Just know, I love the time that we both had
And I don't ever wanna see you sad; be happy
'Cause I don't wanna hold you
If you don't wanna tell me you love me, babe
Just know, I'm gonna have to walk away
I'll be big enough for both of us to say
Be happy
Da-da-do
Da-da-do-do 
Da-da-do-do-do-do-do
Da-da-da-do-do-do-do
Be happy
Mmm
Be happy Hey!
Rocking around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
A mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rocking around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
And you will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Rocking around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
*Instrumental*
Rocking around, rocking around
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Oh, voices singing, let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Rocking around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned wayYou belong among the wildflowers
You belong in a boat out at sea
Sail away, and kill off the hours
You belong somewhere you feel free
Run away and find you a lover
Go away somewhere all bright and new
And I've seen, I've seen no other
No one who compares with you
You belong among the wildflowers
You belong in a boat out at sea
You belong with your love on your arm
You belong somewhere you feel free
Run away, go find a lover
Run away, let your heart be your guide
And you deserve the deepest of cover
You belong in that home by and by
You belong among the wildflowers
You belong somewhere close to me
Far away from your troubles and worries
You belong somewhere you feel free
You belong somewhere you feel free
You belong somewhere you feel freeI come home in the morning light
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh, mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun
The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh, daddy dear, you know you're still number one
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have
That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna, wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna have
Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have
That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

Girls, they wanna have
Girls, they wanna, wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna haveI can honestly say
You've been on my mind
Since I woke up today, up today
I look at your photograph all the time
These memories come back to life
And I don't mind
I remember when we kissed
I still feel it on my lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
I remember the simple things
I remember 'til I cry
But the one thing I wish I'd forget
The memory I wanna forget
Is goodbye
I woke up this morning
And played our song
And through my tears, I sang along
I picked up the phone, and then put it down
'Cause I know I'm wasting my time
And I don't mind
I remember when we kissed
I still feel it on my lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
I remember the simple things
I remember 'til I cry
But the one thing I wish I'd forget
The memory I wanna forget
Suddenly, my cell phone's blowing up
With your ringtone
I hesitate, but answer it anyway
You sound so alone
And I'm surprised to hear you say
You remember when we kissed
You still feel it on your lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
You remember the simple things
We talk 'til we cry
You said that your biggest regret
The one thing you wish I'd forget
Is saying goodbye
Saying goodbye
Oh, goodbyeMy problem isn't that I miss you
'Cause I don't
My problem isn't that I kissed you, woah
I figured out
That you're nothing that I thought you're about
You're just caught in a place
That soon time will erase in my heart
You're my type of guy, I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High for the rest of my life
But people change, thank God I did
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you
Your problem's not for lack of trying
'Cause you do
It's just that you're at your best when you're lying, woah-ooh
Now you're standing here
And saying things you think I wanted to hear
But you've got it all wrong, I've already moved on, my dear
You're my type of guy, I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High for the rest of my life
But people change, thank God I did
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you
When you're standing near me
I don't see so clearly
The feelings are still palpable
But when I take two steps away
It sheds some light on my day
Yeah, you can't go back, it's all in the past
Guess you got to laugh at it
You're my type of guy, I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High for the rest of my life
But people change, thank God I did
And if there's some confusion
Let me tell you, you're just delusional, get a clue
'Cause people change, thank God I did
Thank God I did
Thank God I did
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you, doesn't mean I like you
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now

Tryna make you feel like you're less than that
Giving nothing more better than to make you crack
But really just trying to push your dreams off track
And you know in the end, it'll be okay
'Cause all that really matters are the steps you take
And everything else falls into place

Lord knows we were already dead
Look back and the memory's haunted
Can't believe we did it again, yeah
Can't count all the times that I faked it
Thank God for the thoughts in my head
Killed time, but we both gotta face it
Welcome to the end of the end, yeah
You know me the best
But you hurt me the worst, my darling
I can't pretend anymore
You win some, you lose some
Everybody talks, but they don't know our history
Everybody loves you, but they won't forgive me
Shot through the sky, we burned in the sun
What's done is done, we had some fun
You win some, you lose some
One drink and we're fighting in public
Two drinks and we're back in the bed
Wake up and I'm sick to my stomach
Can't believe we did it again, yeah
You know me the best
But you hurt me the worst, my darling
I can't pretend anymore
You win some, you lose some
Everybody talks, but they don't know our history
Everybody loves you, but they won't forgive me
Shot through the sky, we burned in the sun
What's done is done, we had some fun
You win some, you lose some
Everybody talks, but they don't know our history
Everybody's shocked when they all saw her kiss me
Shot through the sky, we burned in the sun
What's done is done, we had some fun
You win some, you lose some
I'm faded, sedated
See the fire, can't feel it burning
I'm cried out, goodbye now
Oh well, you win some, you lose some
Everybody talks, but they don't know our history
Everybody loves you, but they won't forgive me
Shot through the sky, we burned in the sun
What's done is done, we had some fun
You win some, you lose some
Everybody talks, but they don't know our history
Everybody's shocked when they all saw her kiss me
Shot through the sky, we burned in the sun
What's done is done, we had some fun
You win some, you lose someMmmm, yeah
Goodbye
We never said that we would be perfect
We only said that we'd try
And when you said that we were forever
I guess it's just another lie
Letting me slip right through your fingers
I hope you know it's real this time, yeah
You know that I said I'd never come home for a last goodbye, yeah
I don’t wanna let you go if you still love me
'Cause I don’t wanna see you cry, yeah
But it feels like you and I are dying
And there’s no one that can save our lives, yeah
And I know we're sick and tired of fighting
Sick and tired of being sick and tired, yeah
But I know that you're gonna want me to come home for a last goodbye
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, aye
Bye-ye-ye, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Laying in the dark with you against me
I can't even open my eyes
'Cause the pain has outweighed the pleasure
Don't think I can take another night
How has my best friend become such a stranger?
It seemed like everything was fine
We've already been through this twice
And I'm never coming home for a last goodbye
I don’t wanna let you go if you still love me
'Cause I don’t wanna see you cry, yeah
But it feels like you and I are dying
And there’s no one that can save our lives, yeah
And I know we're sick and tired of fighting
Sick and tired of being sick and tired, yeah
But I know that you're gonna want me to come home for a last goodbye
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, aye
Bye-ye-ye, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
I don’t wanna let you go if you still love me
'Cause I don’t wanna see you cry, yeah
But it feels like you and I are dying
And there’s no one that can save our lives, yeah
And I know we're sick and tired of fighting
Sick and tired of being sick and tired, yeah
But I know that you're gonna want me to come home for a last goodbye
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, aye
Bye-ye-ye, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You let me down
I gave you up
I took you back
I guess I can't blame ya for this when I told myself
I’ll never say that last goodbye
I'll never say...
That last goodbyeOoh, oh, yeah
I didn't wanna listen to what you were sayin'
I thought that I knew all I need to know
I didn't realize that, somewhere inside me
I knew you were right, but I couldn't say so
I can take care of myself, yeah
You taught me well
I learned from you that I do not crumble
I learned that strength is something you choose
All of the reasons to keep on believing
There's no question, that's a lesson that I learned from you
We always don't agree on what is the best way
To get to the place that we're going from here
But I can really trust you and give you the distance
To make your decisions without any fear
I'm grateful for all of the times
You opened my eyes
I learned from you that I do not crumble
I learned that strength is something you choose
All of the reasons to keep on believing
There's no question, that's a lesson I learned from you
You taught me to stand on my own
And I thank you for that
It saved me, it made me
And now that I'm lookin' back
I can say, whoa
Mmm, yeah
I learned from you  that I do not crumble
I learned that strength is something you choose 
All of the reasons to keep on believing 
There's no question, that's a lesson I learned from you
I learned from you, oh, I learned from you
I learned that strength is something you choose 
All of the reasons to keep on believing
There's no question, that's a lesson I learned from you, yeah, yeah
I learned from youAfter twelve, not so well
Won't pretend it's too soon to tell what's around this bend
No disgrace about face
Anything not to have to chase you down again
You know nothing hurts like losin'
When you know it's really gone
Except for the pain of choosin' to hold too long
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us, it's too late
Let the credits start to roll
A lot to say, but not today
Let the radio break the silence as we drive
A kiss goodbye, not this time
Don't remember what about this song I ever liked
You know nothing hurts like losin'
When you know I'm already gone
Except for the pain of choosin' to hold too long
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us, it's too late
Let the credits start to roll
I thought maybe we were gettin' somewhere
But we're still nowhere at all
I watch your tail lights fading
I try, but a tear won't fall
I remember what it feels like
To know love and have it taken away
Can't think of what I've learned right now
But I'll be thanking you someday
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
You know it's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us, it's too late
Let the credits start to roll
Let the credits start to roll
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road, be the end of the road
Will be the end of the road, be the end of the roadThe rain is pouring down
And I’m looking at the window
Thinking I’ma chang my ways
Somehow I do this to myself
But I’m blaming you again
And hold a grudge for days
I learnt from my mamma how to never let it go
But that's not who I really am
There’s a little part of me
With a lot of history
I wanna help you understand
That one day tears flooded
So I decided to be cold-blooded
So I'll never get hurt again
There was someone I loved
Who decided to be cold-blooded
So I'm just gonna blame it on them
I lie and say I'm better on my own
When we're laying here close
It's like laying in the snow
'Cause there's no love
I got cold, cold-blooded
It's getting uncomfortable
It hurts me any time you say I'm pretty
So I try to keep it moving
And I pick a fight to bring up something petty
It’s just that my daddy didn't always know how to say
That he's proud of who I am
There's a little part of me
Holding on history
And I wanna help you understand
That one day the tears flooded
So I decided to be cold-blooded
So I'll never get hurt again
There was someone I loved
Who decided to be cold-blooded
So I'm just gonna blame it on them
I lie and say I'm better on my own
When we're laying here close, it's like laying in the snow, 'cause there's no love
I got, cold, cold-
It's not you, you're perfect
I feel like I don't deserve it
When I can't see my own world
I can't see why you put me first
I lie and say I'm better on my own
When we're laying here close
It's like laying in the snow
'Cause there's no love
I got cold, I got cold
I got cold, I got coldblood
Mmm, mmm, mmm
ColdbloodNobody listens to me
Don't hear a single thing I've said
Say anything to soothe me
Anything to get you from my head
Don't know how really I feel
'Cause it's the faith that makes it like I don't care
Don't know how much it hurts to turn around like you were never there
Like somehow you could be replaced
And I could walk away from the promises we made
And swore we'd never break
I thought I lost you when you ran away to try to find me
I thought I'd never see your sweet face again
I turned around and you were gone, and on, and on the days went
But I kept the moments that we were in
'Cause I hoped in my heart, you'd come back to me, my friend
And now I got you
But I thought I lost you
I felt so empty out there
And there were days I had my doubts
But I knew I'd find you somewhere
Because I knew I couldn't live without you in my life for one more day
And I swore I'd never break a promise that we made
I thought I lost you when you ran away to try to find me
I thought I'd never see your sweet face again
I turned around and you were gone, and on, and on the days went
But I kept the moments that we were in
'Cause I hoped in my heart, you'd come back to me, my friend
And now I got you
But I thought I lost you
I told myself I wouldn't sleep 'til I searched the world from sea to sea
I made a wish upon a star
I turned around, and there you were
And now here we are, are
Here we are
I thought I lost you 
I thought I lost you 
Yeah
I thought I lost you when you ran away to try to find me
I thought I'd never see your sweet face again
I turned around and you were gone, and on, and on the days went
But I kept the moments that we were in
'Cause I hoped in my heart, you'd come back to me, my friend
And now I got you
But I thought I lost you
I thought I lost you 
So glad I got you, got you
So glad I got you, yeah yeah
I thought I lost you These four walls
They whisper to me
They know a secret
I knew they would not keep
Didn't take long
For the room to fill with dust
And these four walls
Came down around us
Must've been something, sent me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again
It's hard now to let you be
I won't make excuses
I've made my peace
Didn't take long
For me to lose the trust
'Cause these four walls
Were not strong enough
Oh, must've been something, sent me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
And now I wait for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again
Yeah, it's difficult
Watchin' us fade
Knowin' it's all my fault
My mistake
Yeah, and it's difficult
Letting you down
Knowin' it's all my fault
You're not around
Must've been something, sent me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again
Again
Oh, these four walls againSo, this is Christmas, and what have you done?
Another year over, and a new one just begun

And so, happy Christmas 
We hope you have fun 
The new and the dear one 
The old and the young 
A very, merry Christmas, and a happy new year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear
War is over if you want it
War is over now
Happy Christmas, everybodyEvery week's the same
Stuck in school, so lame
My parents say that I'm lazy
Gettin' up at 8 a.m.'s crazy
Tired of bein' told what to do
So unfair, so uncool
The day's too long
And I'm holding on
'Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's time when we're gonna
Breakout, let the party start
We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go, oh, oh 
Hanging out's just something we like to do
My friends, and the mess we get into
These are the lessons that we choose
Not a book full of things we'll never use
The day's too long
And I'm holding on
'Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's time when we're gonna
Breakout, let the party start
We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go, oh, oh 
Wish it would never end
Spendin' time with my friends
Oh, with my friends
Breakout, let the party start
We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go
Breakout, let the party start
We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go, oh, oh I been in a rut, back and forth enough, heart like a wheel
Without you around, so uncomfortable is how it feels
Every time you're near, trouble disappears under the ground
But when you go too far, silver clouds will start hanging around
And I know why
Try to run, but I keep on comin' back full circle
And I can't jump the track
Can't let you go, oh, oh, oh
Tied to one, so I keep on comin' back full circle
'Cause I know you'll come around, you'll come around
Skippin' down a broken path
How long can I last? Please let me know
Where's the finish line? 'Cause I've got to find somewhere to go
I don't wanna hear people interfere, what do they know?
What I feel inside when I'm up all night needing you home
I don't know why
Try to run, but I keep on comin' back full circle
And I can't jump the track
Can't let you go, oh, oh, oh
Tied to one, so I keep on comin' back full circle
'Cause I know you'll come around, you'll come around
'Cause I know you'll come around, you'll come around
I'll keep on runnin' 'til we meet in the middle
I'll put pride aside, and I'll give just a little
There's miles to go, but we both know that we'll make it
And I know why
Try to run, but I keep on comin' back full circle
And I can't jump the track
Can't let you go, oh
Tied to one, so I keep on comin' back full circle
'Cause I know you'll come around, you'll come around
Yeah, I know you'll come around
You'll come around
Yeah, I know you'll come around
You'll come aroundWe both lie silently still in the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together, we feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you
Yeah, I tried
But I guess that's why they say...
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yeah, it does
I listen to our favorite song playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder, does he know?
Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I, I could let you know somehow
Every rose has its thorn 
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But that scar, that scar remains 
Every rose, every rose
Every rose has its thorn
I know I could've saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of making love, we both made our separate ways
And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
And to hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
Every rose has its thorn 
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yeah, it doesWake up, here I go
Cram it all down my throat
Stomach's so full that I wish I could choke
7AM, my head's already in a spin
As soon as I'm out that door
Bam, it hits me like a ton of those red bricks
Can't dig myself out of this highest ditch
This madness
I swear, sometimes, I can't tell
Which way is up, which way is down
It's all up in my face, need to push it away
Somebody, push it away
So all that I can hear
Is a simple song
Sing along now
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
Midday sun beatin' on the concrete
Burnin' up my feet
Too many cars on the street
The noise, the red, the green
Makes me wanna scream
Five o'clock, now it's bumper on bumper on bumper
Horns honkin', nobody's looking, but everybody's talkin'
Just another day on this highway
I swear, sometimes, I can't tell
Which way is up, which way is down
It's all up in my face, need to push it away
Somebody, push it away
'Cause all I wanna hear
Oh, is a simple song, mmm
Sing along now
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
Hey
Sing along now
Sing along
What I'd give to turn it off
And make it stop, make it stop
You gotta make it stop
So all that I can hear
Is a simple song, mmm
Sing along now
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, da, da, da
La, la, la, la, la
La, da, da, daI know this isn’t what I wanted
Never thought it'd come this far
I'm thinking back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are
We were young and times were easy
I could see it's not the same
I'm standing here but you don't see me
I'd give it all for that to change
And I don’t want to lose her
I don’t want to let her go
I'm standing out in the rain
I need to know if it’s over
Cause I will leave you alone
Flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her like I did before the storm
Before the storm
And with every strike of lightning
Comes a memory that lasts
Not a word is left unspoken as the thunder starts to crash
Maybe I should give up
I'm standing out in the rain
I need to know if it’s over
Cause I will leave you alone
Flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her like I did before the storm
Before the storm
Trying to keep the light from going in
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart
We always say a heart is not whole
Without the one who gets you through the storm
Standing out in the rain, knowing that it's really over
Please don't leave me alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold you, like I did before the storm
Yeah, like I did before the stormHappy holidays everybody, especially you
Come on! Alright, now this is a song everybody should know. So I wanna hear y'all sing along. Yeehaw!
Just hear those sleigh bells ringling ting ting tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "yoo hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Baby 
Here we go. Altogether
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
My baby 
Alright now everybody's gotta do these ahh's with me. You guys ready? Y'all will catch on
Aahh, aahh, aahh, aahh
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Baby! With youKiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive
Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight
Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadnessIt's been like this from the start
One piece after another to make my heart
You mistake the game for being smart
Stand here, sell this, and hit your mark
But the sound of the steel
And the crush, and the grind
It all screams, "Who am I to decide my life?"
But in time it all dies
There's nothing left inside
Just rusted metal that was never even mine
I would scream
But I'm just this hollow shell
Waiting here
Begging, "Please, set me free so I can feel"
Hey
Stop trying to live my life for me
I need to breathe
I'm not your robot
Stop telling me I'm part of the big machine
I'm breaking free
Can't you see?
I can move, I can speak without somebody else operating me
You gave me eyes, and now I see
I'm not your robot, I'm just me
All this time, I've been misled
There were nothing but crossed wires in my head
I've been taught to think that what I feel
Doesn't matter at all 'til you say it's real
I would scream
But I'm just this hollow shell
Waiting here
Begging, "Please, set me free so I can feel"
Hey
Stop trying to live my life for me
I need to breathe
I'm not your robot
Stop telling me I'm part of the big machine
I'm breaking free
Can't you see?
I can move, I can speak without somebody else operating me
You gave me eyes, and now I see
I'm not your robot, I'm just me
I'm not your robot, I'm just me
I'm not your robot
I would scream
But I'm just this hollow shell
Waiting here
Begging, "Please, set me free so I can feel"
Hey
Stop trying to live my life for me
I need to breathe
I'm not your robot
Stop telling me I'm part of the big machine
I'm breaking free
Can't you see?
I can move, I can speak without somebody else operating me
You gave me eyes, and now I see
I'm not your robot, I'm just me
I'm not your robot, I'm just me
I'm not your robotYou drive a classic Mustang

Plus you got that nice leather with no stains
Smell like "daaang"

Who is this guy?
I think he really turns me on
Everything is classic, no need to ask why
Where do I sign? I'm gone

Cruising all and crashing

Several moments of your consideration
Leading up to the final destination

Wake up, America
Tomorrow becomes a new day
And everything you do matters

Stand up, I'll try if you will
Wake up, it's not a fire drill
All she needs is a little attention
Can you give her just a little attention?
Oh, it's easy to look away
But it's getting harder day by day
Everything I read's global warming, going green
I don't know what all this means
But it seems to be saying

Keep myself alive by candlelight
Say she can't love you like I do
Look me in the eyes and say it's true
I ask myself, "Is this love at all?"
When I need you most, you let me fall
I'm always here at the side of your stage
Let you live your life, pretend I'm okay
Don't you know that this ain't over?
I'll be okay
I'll hold you close, we'll stay forever
I, I don't understand why you're leaving me
I, I don't understand how without you, I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand, I'm bleeding tears
I don't understand why you can't take me with you
You can pretend I don't exist
But you see my face every time you kiss
I hope you hurt and your walls fall down
When you hear the sound that I'm okay
Don't you know that this ain't over?
I'll be okay
You can't hold me down, I won't stay forever
I, I don't understand why you're leaving me

The moon is low in the sky
I feel like going out
Before the night passes by
I won't just sit around
When life becomes a drag

I like the boom
I need guitar
I like that drum when it goes
Boom d'boom d'boom

As soon as my album goes number one
Mr. Lind, I'd like a Rolex with forty diamondsSeems like we're holding on forever
I gotta let it go
Time's up, you pushed me to surrender, tonight
Who knows what happens now, whatever
Wherever the wind blows
And I'm there as long as we're together
Alright
Let's have the time of our lives
Like there's no one else around
Just throw your hands up high
Even when they try to take us down
We'll have the time of our lives
'Til the lights burn out
Let's laugh until we cry
Life is only what you make it now
Let's have the time of our lives
Dreamers don't care if it's right
I think I'm really into you
Restless, let's leave it all behind
Tonight
Crazy when you cross my mind
Oh, the trouble we could get into
So what? Let’s just give this a try
Alright
Let's have the time of our lives
Like there's no one else around
Just throw your hands up high
Even when they try to take us down
We'll have the time of our lives
'Til the lights burn out
Let's laugh until we cry
Life is only what you make it now
Let's have the time of our lives
Looking back, what are we waiting for?
Take that chance, now's all we got for sure
Let's have the time of our lives
Like there's no one else around
Just throw your hands up high
Even when they try to take us down
We'll have the time of our lives
'Til the lights burn out
Let's laugh until we cry
Life is only what you make it now
Let's have the time of our livesI've been stranded on a lonely street
Got lost in the shadows
Fell hard in the battle
Heard cries and the suffering
Walked through the darkness
Left broken and heartless
I'm calling out, can you hear my voice?
I'm gonna find you through all the noise
You know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
Shine your light as I reach for you
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest and it runs through my blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
Whoa, oh oh oh yeah
I've been told at least a thousand times
"It's not worth the struggle, the hurt, or the trouble"
I keep running up to these front lines
No, I won't surrender
I'll wait here forever
Standing here with my flag held high
Can't you see that it's worth the fight?
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest and it runs through my blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
Whoa, oh oh oh yeah
I've marched across this battlefield
I'm screaming out, can you hear me now?
I'm holding on, I stand my ground
I'm screaming out, can you hear me now?
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest and it runs through my blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest and it runs through my blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love, for loveI have to wonder if this wave's too big to ride
Commit or not commit in such a crazy tide
It's sooner than I thought, but you called me out
I lost control and there's no doubt
I'm gonna start all over
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
I'm gonna start all over
Fantastic and romantic, all a big surprise
You got the warning, hesitation pushed aside
It's sooner than I want, but you caught my heart
I guess I'm ready now to start
I'm gonna start all over
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
I'm gonna start all over
It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy 
I'm gonna start all over 
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
I'm gonna start all overImagining you're far away
Searching for the words to say
I feel it when you fall apart
Our lives are our greatest art
I don't wanna change your mind
'Cause I accept you for everything you are and will be
Stay here with me now
The only thing that our hearts are made of
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
The only thing real, when push comes to shove
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
'Cause in the end, no one loses or wins
The story begins, again and again
With forgiveness and love
You don't ever have to read my mind
You can see it when you close your eyes
Don't believe it when you lose your faith
Another moment is a moment away
I can't tell you what the future holds or how to live
All I know is what feels right lights up my life again and again
The only thing that our hearts are made of
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
The only thing real, when push comes to shove
Are the acts of forgiveness and love
'Cause in the end, no one loses or wins
The story begins, again and again
With forgiveness and love
Let's jump the sun
Let's find forever
Where does the time go?
Just live your life
You'll get another today, today, today
Forgiveness and love
'Cause in the end, no one loses or wins
The story begins again and again
With forgiveness and love
Let's jump the sun
Let's jump the sun
Let's jump the sun
Forgiveness and loveI can pretend that I don't see you
I can pretend I don't wanna hold you when you're around
When you're around
I can say that nothing was right
But we know if I looked in your eyes, I'd break down
Yeah, let's break down
If I could have just one night to be with you
To make it right
To what we were and what we are is hidden in the scars
If I could take you there
I won’t let go of this, I swear
You won't have to wonder what we are
'Cause you won't have to ever look too far; it's in the scars
It's hidden in the scars
If I told you that I love you
But I'm doing alright without you, it'd be a lie
But I could try
I'd run a thousand miles, believing
You're the only one I want to free me to break down
Yeah, let's break down
If I could have just one night to be with you
To make it right
To what we were and what we are is hidden in the scars
If I could take you there
I won’t let go of this, I swear
You won't have to wonder what we are
'Cause you won't have to ever look too far; it's in the scars
Yeah, I'll tell you all my secrets
All the ones I've kept inside
And I'll give you all the reasons that you faded from my life
I won't let you go, baby, come here close
I won't let you walk away
If I could have just one night to be with you
To make it right
To what we were and what we are is hidden in the scars
If I could take you there
I won’t let go of this, I swear
You won't have to wonder what we are
'Cause you won't have to ever look too far; it's in the scars
It's hidden in the scars
Hidden in the scars
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can pretend that I don't see you
And I can pretend I don't wanna hold you when you're aroundAre you overloaded, can't decode it?
Your life's imploding now
There's a risk worth takin', a pain worth achin'
On this hollow ground
 Let go, don't hold onto
All of life's hardest parts
When we think of stoppin', let's keep on rockin'
To the rhythm of our hearts
We can, we can break out of here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can, we can forget the pace
Win in our own race
Become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah
Good and broken
Find the magic, go and grab it
Your fate is in your hands
C'mon, find a reason to believe and
Just tell yourself we can
We can, we can break out of here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can, we can forget the pace
Win in our own race
Become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah
Good and broken
Get off your seat, on your feet
Raise your hands, feel the beat
Let it go, lose control
Feel it in your soul
Don't you know what you can do
If you have faith in you?
Let's not be invisible
There's no red light in life, just go
We can, we can break out of here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can, we can forget the pace
Win in our own race
Become a broken chain, yeah 
We are broken chains, yeah 
Good and broken
 Yeah
We can, we can, we can, we can
We can
We can, we can, we can, we can
We can
We can, we can, we can, we can
We can
Good and brokenI need to feel your heartbeat when you say you love me
I don't wanna hear it, if it's something that you don't mean
If I had to leave you now, there would be an empty space
It doesn't matter anyhow
You can take your things and go your own way
And there's two more lonely people in the world tonight
Baby, you and I are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight
Yeah, wrong or right
Well, you know my heart is aching
You don't have to break it
If love don't change your mind
Then there's two more lonely people, tonight
I don't want the pictures, I don't want your sympathy
We don't have to be friends, we don't have to be enemies
In my head, I break it down and I'm absolutely sure
That you and I could work it out
Or we could kill the lights on what we had before
And there's two more lonely people in the world tonight
Baby, you and I are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight
Yeah, wrong or right
Well, you know my heart is aching
You don't have to break it
If love don't change your mind
Then there's two more lonely people
Well, we got something special, that should be enough
Nothing is predictable when it comes to love
Maybe lately, baby, it's been a little rough
But if you walk away tonight
We'll be two more lonely people in the world tonight
Baby, you and I are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight
And there's two more lonely people in the world tonight
Baby, you and I are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight
Yeah, wrong or right
Well, you know my heart is aching
You don't have to break it
If love don't change your mind
Then there's two more lonely people, tonightIt's 6AM and I'm wide awake
'Cause I can't stop thinkin'
'Bout the stuff you were sayin' to me
And I, I can't let it slide
The paper's not here yet, the sun's not up
But I'm not afraid
To tell you what I feel inside
I had one of those dreams that makes it all so
Clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective
It's so clear to me now
You can't treat me that way
It appears to me how
Long you tried to make me think
It was me who was being the fake
So clear
Why did I smile when I hurt inside?
Said I was okay, when I knew it's a lie
I wanted to believe in you
You took your chances and one was me
So I'll just forgive you and set you free
Yeah, I'm on my way
Yeah, I'm stepping out of the haze, and it's so
Clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective 
It's so clear to me now
You can't treat me that way
It appears to me how
Long you tried to make me think
It was me who was being the fake
So clear
I wanna put the past behind
Try and maybe I can find better days
The first time in a while
Think I even feel a smile on my face
I got a whole new perspective
You can't treat me that way, it's so
Clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective 
It's so clear to me now 
You can't treat me that way 
It appears to me how
Long you tried to make me think
It was me who was being the fake
So clear
Yeah, so clear, so clear, so clear
Sun's going down on a Saturday
And I feel alright, I feel okayI'll be right here where you need me
Anytime, just keep believin'
And I'll be right here
If you ever need a friend
Someone to care and understand
I'll be right here
All you have to do is call my name
No matter how close or far away
Ask me once and I'll come, I'll come runnin'
And when I can't be with you, dream me near
Keep me in your heart and I'll appear
All you gotta do is turn around, close your eyes, look inside
I'm right here
Isn't it great that you know that
I'm ready to go wherever you're at?
Anywhere, I'll be there
All you have to do is call my name
No matter how close or far away
Ask me once and I'll come, I'll come runnin'
And when I can't be with you, dream me near
Keep me in your heart and I'll appear
All you gotta do is turn around, close your eyes, look inside
I'm right here
Whenever you need me
There's no need to worry
You know that I'm gonna be right here
Ask me once and I'll come, I'll come runnin'
And when I can't be with you, dream me near
Keep me in your heart and I'll appear
All you gotta do is turn around, close your eyes, look inside
I'm right here
Oh, yeah, yeah
I'm right hereGonna stay in bed today
'Cause I can't stand the light
Don't know why I get so down
I won't be much fun tonight
And I can't believe
You still want to hang around me
It's not so pretty all the time
You don't mind
To you, it's alright
As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk, you listen to me
As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the piece that's missin'
I'm lookin' at him
I'm not the girl you think you see
But maybe that's a lie
You almost know me better than
Me, myself, and I
Don't know a lot of things
But I know what I got
It's not so perfect every day
I don't have to try
'Cause it all falls into place
As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk, you listen to me
As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the piece that's missin'

Face to face, eye to eye
You're standin' there
Feels good on the inside
I don't mind, I don't care
You're standin' there
Seein' me for the first time
Seein' me for the first time
Seein' me for the first time
As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk, you listen to me
As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the piece that's missin'
I'm lookin' at him
Found the piece that's missin'

Take me as I am 
Found the piece that's missin'
Take me as I amI've been to London, been to Paris, Australia and Rome
There's sexy boys in every city, but they're not what I want
Some got money, some got fame
Some got cars and the clothes
But if it just ain’t you, then I don't wanna know
'Cause baby, now I realize that I was wrong
When I said I didn't need you so
Miss you bad, so now I'm coming home
So you better leave the light on
Wait for me and just leave the light on

Won't let you go, no
Go, go, go, go - no, no, no, no
I've been to New York, been to L.A. and to Baton Rouge
I met a boy in every city, no one kept me amused
But don't call me a Lolita, 'cause I don't let 'em through
'Cause I'm saving all my loving for someone and it's you
'Cause baby, now I realize that I was wrong
When I said I didn't need you so
Miss you bad, so now I'm coming home
So you better leave the light on
Wait for me and just leave the light on
It's been like a permanent December
So much colder than I can remember
When I get you back, this time I swear that I won't

When I said I didn't need you so

The way you let her kiss you and the way you say her name
You like to call me crazy, I don’t know that I’m insane
But you used to look at me, the way you look at Mary Jane
I wish you looked at me the way you looked at Mary Jane
Knowing that you’re losing me I wonder what you gain
My heart was in your hands but now you got hold of my brain
I wish you looked at me the way you looked at
Oh, I wanna be that one, I wanna be that song
That you can repeat all night long and
Oh, you still have that something, but you know that something’s gone, you know that something’s gone
Na, na na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na, na na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na na
Oh, having to pretend, is getting exhausting
Acting like I’m living and you know I’m dead and oh
Was there something that I said?
There something that I did?
Make you choose here instead
You still look at me the way you look at Mary Jane
The way that I kiss you and the way you say her name
You like to call me crazy, like I don’t know that I’m insane
You used to look at me, ahh ahh, the way you look at
Oh, I used to turn you on, I used to be that song
The one that you could play on repeat all night long and
Oh, we used to have that something
But we know that something’s gone, we know that something’s gone
Na, na na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na na na na na na na na
Na, na na na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na naWhy do I just lie awake and think of you?
I need some sleep
Tomorrow I have things to do
Every time I close my eyes, I see your face
So I try to read, but all I do is lose my place
Am I obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you
But I do all the time
I do all the time
I just had to call you up and say hello
I know it's 3 AM
And I saw you a while ago
But I still have this aching pain to hear your voice
To know you're there
I don't seem to have any choice
Am I obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you
But I do all the time
I do all the time
I'm so sorry, I just had to wake you up
I feel so lonely by myself
Is this the way it feels when you're in love?
Or is this something else?
Yeah
Am I obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you
But I do all the time
Want you all the time
Ooh, yeah, but I do all the time
I want you all the time
Am I obsessed with you?It's our party we can say what we want

Sorry IRS
Ooh, yeah!
Too bad astronaut
Shut it downI never came to the beach, or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore, under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
In Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start

I never sat by the shore, under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same, and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do we even exist?
That's when I make the wish, to swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Ah-ah-ah
Next to youRight now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
I'm pickin' it up, I'm pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up
Yeah, we turnin' it up
Ain't got no tears in my body
I ran out, but boy, I like it, I like it, I like it
Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it
We out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'
Comin' out, even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now, can't stop so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth, and if you don't know
Then now you know it, babe
Yeah, you know it, babe, yeah
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
I just want you to come with me
We're on another mentality
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, I'm pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
Pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
Yeah, we turnin' it up
They point out colors in you, I see 'em too
And, boy, I like 'em, I like 'em, I like 'em
We're way too fly to partake in all this hate
We out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'
Comin' out, even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now, can't stop so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth, and if you don't know
Then now you know it, babe
Yeah, you know it, babe, yeah

Even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop so shut your mouth
Even when it's rainin' down
We turnin' upWhat am I supposed to say
When I only speak the truth?
If you're trying to inflict more pain
Then you're good at what you do
But we may never be the same
That's what brings me back to you
And you electrify my brain
You electrify my brain
I'm screaming out, out
My insides coming out, out
Said we'd make it thru this time around, round
But look what's already happening now, now
My insides coming out
My insides
My insides coming out
You electrify my brain
Woke up this morning but I'm dead
And I can't get out of my head
And I didn't really get much sleep
'Cause you came to me in my dreams
I never really thought you'd leave
Take your freedom and making a change
And you electrify my brain
You electrify my brain
You electrify my brain
You electrify my brain
You electrify my brain
I'm screaming out, out
My insides coming out, out
Said we'd make it thru this time around, round
But look what's already happening now, now
My insides coming out
My insides coming out
My insides coming out
My insides coming out
You electrify my brain
Covered in blood, covered in goo
Covered in tears, covered in glue
Oh I'm missing you, oh I'm missing you
Colored in green, colored in blue
Colored in gold, colored maroon
Oh I'm missing you, oh I'm missing you
You electrify my brain
I don't want you to go
I need you to stay
But I want you to know
This back and forth can drive me crazy
I'm scattered across the room
Want you to come and pick me up
It was my heart that you threw
But I'm still missing you
You electrify my brain, brain
But I'm still missing you
You electrify my brain
What am I supposed to say
When I only speak the truth?I’ve seen love go by my door
It’s never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
Shooting in the dark too long
When something’s not right, it’s wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
Dragon clouds so high above
I've only known careless love
It's always hit me from below
But this time around it is more correct
Right on target, so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
Purple clover, Queen Anne's lace
Crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry, if you don't know
Can't remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoiling me with too much love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river running slow and lazy
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time
Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mine have been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud
But there's no way I can compare
All those scenes to this affair
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing
Staying far behind without you
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying
Make me give myself a good talking-to
I'll look for you in old Honolulu
San Francisco, Ashtabula
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know
I'll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass, in the ones I love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
Oh, you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
Oh, you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're gonna make me lonesome when you goEvery time we turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
Public display of affection
Seems like no one else in the room
We can get down like there's no one around
They keep on watching, we keep on rocking
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watching
‘Cause like they’re probably saying
Gimme, gimme more
Give me more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme more

The center of attention
Even when I’m up against the wall
You got me in a crazy position
If you're on a mission
You’ve got my permission
We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking, we keep on rocking
Oh, cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
We keep rocking
They’re saying, we hear ‘em

Even when you're in your head baby, even when you’re in your mind
Breaking open the seal, let me see what's inside
Want to crawl into the dark spaces, hold them up into the light
Highs and lows your chemicals, I'm coming close to overdose
I can only stay this high, so long, so long, oh
So if I fall baby
I’m gonna take you down
Only love gonna save us now
If I fall, then you're going down with me
So if I fall
Let me live on hollow ground
In your arms where I'm safe and sound
If I fall, then you're going down with me
Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee
Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee
Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee
Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee
Tell me what do you see when you look into my eyes
Is there a flicker of a lost lightning?
Or are you riding for the sky?
And when the water recedes and the ocean's on the rise
Will you see it through the storm's passing?
Are you running from the tide?
Highs and lows your chemicals, I'm coming close to overdose
I can only stay this high, so long, so long, oh
So if I fall baby
I'm gonna take you down
Only love gonna save us now
If I fall, then you’re going down with me

I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were somethin' special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again
I've got a way of knowin' when somethin' is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again
I got this crazy feelin' deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader, but I'm readin' the sign
That you can't wait to see me again
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then

I got my sights set on you, and I'm ready to aim
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you againI remember

See my friends out tonight under these city lights
In the club 'til someone starts a fight
And we get in the car

And I’m so tired
You’re fired
I’m so jealous, restless, relentless
That’s just me

Don't make me beg for the things I need
You know what they say
Where there’s a will, there’s a way
Lies are free, talk is cheap
Now we're out in the street, and we're sweating the heat
And we move with the traffic and the beat
I don’t care if you choke when you light up your smoke
It’s the one thing I can call my own
It's so tragic
I'm so manic
I’m so jealous, restless, relentless
That’s just me

Every guy, everywhere just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection
I always gets a ten, 'cause I'm built like that

They try to change me, but they realize they can't 
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan

If there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya
I'm not here to sell ya or tell you to go to hell
I'm not a brat like that
I'm like a puzzle, but all of my pieces are jagged
If you can understand this, we can make some magic
I'm wrong like that
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go 
I wanna be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode
Baby, by now you should know

Don't change me, don't change me
Don't change me, don't change me
Dang it, you can't stop me
You can't hold me
You can't have me
You'll me amaze
I like to party

I made a detour out the game when I was hustlin' crack
Made a couple of dollars, made a little bit of change, never looked back
You can find me at the shootin' range practicin' bustin' gats
Or in a vocal booth in the studio, bustin' raps
Put some gold on my body, got my body off Carlos Rossi
I'm sloppy, I treat my luxury scraper like a Bugatti
La di da di, she like to party off molly, Bacardi
Let her get naughty, a hotty up in the lobby, she stopped, she said
"Fortywater, where you 'bout to be?"
I said, "Follow me, follow me, follow me, bitch, room 223"
You got to pay me or pay me no attention, that's how I do
When you're born and raised in the V, Northern Cali, Silicon Valley

I evaporate them 
Hey, tell me Miley what’s good 
Tell me Miley what’s good 
I spent my time
I spent my nights in the sun
Poor me, poor me, poor me
I’m gon’ get mine
Everyday ‘til I’m done
Poor me, poor me
In my spaceship, renovating 
Get my blunt rolled
This is my town, this is my turn
I do it my way
Watch and you’ll learn
I win what’s mine
I spent my nights in the sun
Poor me...R-O-C-K
Mafia
Creation shows me what to do
I'm dancing on the floor with you
And when you touch my hand
I go crazy, yeah
The music tells me what to feel
I like you now, but is it real?
By the time we say goodnight
I'll know if this is right
And I feel you
Pumping through my veins
Am I into you?
Or is the music to blame?
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Did you make my night?
Or did they do spinning the breaks I like?
Cause baby, if they stop the music, and I'm still into ya
Then I guess there'll be no doubt tonight
Who owns my heart?
The room is full, but all I see is
The way your eyes just blaze through me
Like fire in the dark
We're like living art
And it hits me
Like a tidal wave
Are you feeling me?
Or is the music to blame?
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Did you make my night?
Or did they do spinning the breaks I like?
Cause baby, if they stop the music, and I'm still into ya
Then I guess there'll be no doubt tonight
Who owns my heart?
My heart
Who owns my heart?
And it hits me
Like a tidal wave
Are you feeling me?
Or is the music to blame?
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Did you make my night?
Or did they do spinning the breaks I like?
Cause baby, if they stop the music, and I'm still into ya
Then I guess there'll be no doubt tonight
Who owns my heart?No one has a heaven or hell to put me through
But you do
No fate could fill me up or drug could keep me high
Like you do
No one else can understand it all I ever wanted
Was you too
If the world stops caring all that matters to me is
If you do
No one makes me wanna believe in anything
But you do
All I know is I can close my eyes and I can fall right
Into you
Oh I never wanna miss you baby
I hate we have to die one day
I’d hold my breath to die together
As long as forever is with you youSomeday, someday, someday, oh
Someday, someday, someday, oh
Someday, someday, someday, oh
Someday, someday, someday
No boy, don't call me feisty
I worked too hard for this, oh-oh-oh
No boy, no boy can find me easy to resist
But you boy, you boy
I know somewhere you exist
Yeah, I'm gonna find you
Someday, someday
I ain’t going to find you in London or Rome
Ain’t gonna find you staying at home
Ain’t gonna find you on the dance floor
Ain’t gonna find you there for sure
I'm gonna find you if I keep living
Someday
Hey world, are you listening?
I got so much to say
I know it is a small world, small world
But sometimes I can't find my way
And I know, I know
It could happen any day
Just around the corner, I'm gonna find you
Someday
I ain’t going to find you in London or Rome
Ain’t gonna find you staying at home

You know but seriouslyAlways get his way
Talks 100 miles per hour
But you hear just what he says
Let’s go
You’re dying again
There’s a part of you that calls him
'Cause you got some time to blow
And your head just wants to hear him
But your heart 
I didn't leave him, girl
It was the other way around
That boy can get your ego going
Yeah
My heart is not a rubber band
And with every pull I take
I know I risk a chance to snap
And you didn’t care about that
I know
This is for all my girls
I understand what you're going through, hey
And back and forth 
And back and forth 
This is for all my girls
On the other side of town...If you wanna be Bright Minded, there’s just one place to go
When you’re stuck at home, and the time is ticking slow
Monday through Friday, live with Miley on my Instagram show
Stay lit everybodyMmm, mmm, mmm
Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name, only "baby"
The more that you give, the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
It’s just the last one left a scar that made you bleed
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me
I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la
I'm everything they said I would be
I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you tonight
Mama says you don't look happy
Close your eyes
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
It’s just the last one left a scar that made you bleed
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me
I'm everything they said I would be
La la la
La la la la
La la la
Oh-ah-ah
Ah, oh
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
It’s just the last one left a scar that made you bleed
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me, oh
Angels like you can't fly down here with meToo infatuated, I see
Everything I say and do
Is for youEverybody knows the bones
Just had to find a way
Everybody knows what I am talking about
That is how I'll get an "A"
My body's many parts
And this is where it starts
Phalanges, I have ten
And Metatarsals then
I got some tarsal’s too
I will put them in my shoes
The Fibula is next
According to my text
Then comes the tibia
That ain't no phobia
And now I am up to my knee
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's the patella to me
We're doing the bone dance
You study the answers
Again and again 'til I get it right
We are doing the bone dance
You dance and you will learn it
And we won't not mess up this test
We'll get it perfect
And now I take it home with the Partial bone
It might be crazy, but we learn that way
Temporal and Frontal too
And now we are finally through
That makes two hundred and six
I found a way that clicks
Bone thugs in the house
We're doing the bone dance
You study the answers
Again and again 'til I get it right
We are doing the bone dance
You dance and you will learn it
And we won't not mess up this test
We'll get it perfect
Word!Sometimes I wonder
If everything changed, how would we make out?
And now suddenly thunder and everything's changed
There's this big dark cloud, hovering
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
Troubling
Stumbling
Fumbling
For the words that say that I'm leaving you
I'm leaving you
We go through the motions like everything's settled
But it's inside out
And it makes us uncomfortable, still holding on
When there's all this doubt, hovering
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
Troubling
Stumbling
Fumbling
For the words that say that I'm leaving you
I'm leaving you
And maybe we're just older
Just a little older
'Cause the fact that this is over
The fact that this is over with you's been...
Hovering
Hovering
Hovering
Troubling
Stumbling
Fumbling
For the words that say that I'm leaving you
I'm leaving you

Sleepy eyes on the ashes that remain
You used me up
Yeah, you thought I was the same girl
But I'm not the same girl
Living in your shamed world
Like a ghost, now you live inside my head
You're barely here, I don't remember why I bled for you
You got a whole lot of things that I don't need
You're about the troubles so just go ahead and grab me
You can take me anywhere you want anywhere you need it
Baby, don't be shy

Tryin' out our brand new bikinis
Maybe drive a few boys crazy
Makin' sure the fun never ends
We're goin' to the beach this weekend
One suitcase
Makeup and a camera
Few bucks for Pepsi and a pizza
Lips locked
And water tube toe rings
Take a ride in a ragtopedo
And cruise the coastline, listenin' to the Eagles
And turn it up, so everyone can hear us sing
We're goin' to the beach this weekend
Me and some of my best girlfriends
Playin' in the clear, blue water
Ridin' double long wave runners
Dancin' 'cross the red hot summer sand
Lookin' pretty hot in our new tans
Makin' sure the fun never ends

Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever, trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours - We live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust, I seek; and I find in you
Every day, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
So close, no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever, trusting who we are

Forever, trusting who we are
No, nothing else mattersOoh, yeah
Sometimes I couldn't hear what
You tried to tell me
I thought that I knew all I need to know
I didn't understand that
The doors you would open
Could take me to somewhere
I wanted to go
I can be strong for you now
You taught me how
I learned from you that
I do not crumble
I learned that strength is
Something you choose
All of the reasons
To keep on believing
There's no question
That's a lesson
I learned from you
You know where to find all of my hiding places
And there are no secrets from you I can keep
You let me know how you feel
Pulling no punches
And I never knew that kind of honesty
I'm grateful for all of the times
You opened my eyes
I learned from you that
I do not crumble
I learned that strength is
Something you choose
All of the reasons
To keep on believing
There's no question
That's a lesson
I learned from you
You help me to stand on my own
And I thank you for that
It saved me, it made me
And now that I'm looking back
I can say, oh-oh-oh
I learned from you that
I do not crumble
I learned that strength is
Something you choose
All of the reasons
To keep on believing
There's no question
That's a lesson
I learned from you

There's no question
That's a lesson
I learned from you, yeah-yeah
I learned from youI lost myself on a cool damp night
I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see and be who I want to be
When I think more than I ought to think
And do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you
Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady
Like my love
Listen me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she, coming near here
Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unready
Where's my love?
Listen to me
Why is everything so hazy
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?
Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Where's my love?
I, I feel unready for my loveI know 
There will be those days
I wanna hide under my pillow, yeah
And I'm sure 
That the clouds will come
And try to rain on my parade, but
I won't let that get me down
I'll laugh until the sun comes out, 'cause...
Oh you can't hurt this girl
Won't hurt this girl
Not this girl, no
She won't listen to you
And your lies
Can't you see why I'm
Not this girl
Can't like you or myself
What do I know
Need a finish line needing to find
Somewhere to collect my thoughts and
Better myself and try to be
Somewhere better than me
What a shame, I'm not this girl
The one who hides in her own little world
Now there are miles to go
And I'm not that girl, anymore
Not this girl
AnymoreThese clouds aren't going nowhere, baby
Rain keeps coming down
I just thought I'd try to call you, baby
For you got too far out of town
And I hope that you get this message that I'm leaving for you
Cause I hate that you left without hearing the words that I needed you to
And I hope you find it
What you're looking for
And I hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be
And so much more
And I hope you're happy, wherever you are
I wanted you to know that
And nothing's going to change that
And I hope you find it
Am I supposed to hang around and wait forever?
Last words that I said
But that was nothing but a broken heart talking, baby
You know that wasn't what I meant
Call me up, let me know that you got this message that I'm leaving for you
Cause I hate that you left without hearing the words that I needed you to
And I hope you're happy, wherever you are
I wanted you to know that
And nothing's going to change that
And I hope you find it
Whatever it is out there that you were missing here
And I hope you're happy wherever you are
I wanted you to know that
And nothing's going to change that
No, no, no
And I hope you find it
I hope you find it
Mmm
OohCome up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the startI can't describe
The way I feel, the way I feel
Oh, what a high
The way I feel, the way I feel
I just can't put in words
What I feel for you
The way I feel, the way I feel
It feels so good it hurts
What you do
The way I feel, the way I feel
I feel like I'm in love
It's too much hype, just because
I feel like sayin' something that's for us
That defines what's in our hearts
Dancin' and we're playin' around
You know you've got me
And then the feelin' comes rainin' down
All over my body
It tingles here, tingles there
Ooh, it tingles everywhere
That's why I've never found
The way to describe it
I can't describe
The way I feel, the way I feel
Oh, what a high
The way I feel, the way I feel
I just can't put in words
What I feel for you
The way I feel, the way I feel
It feels so good it hurts
What you do
The way I feel, the way I feel
This feels right, as the buzz
And it don't describe when we uh
You feel my heartbeat thumpin' from your touch
In my life, you were my luck
Dancin' and we're playin' around
You know you've got me
And then the feelin' comes rainin' down
All over my body
It tingles here, tingles there
Ooh, it tingles everywhere
That's why I've never found
The way to describe it
I can't describe
The way I feel, the way I feel
Oh, what a high
The way I feel, the way I feel
I just can't put in words
What I feel for you
The way I feel, the way I feel
It feels so good it hurts
What you do
The way I feel, the way I feel
The morning
Hopefully at 10 o'clock we're both yawnin'
Right now
Think about it later, let's just both get down
I can't describe
The way I feel, the way I feel
Oh, what a high
The way I feel, the way I feel
I just can't put in words
What I feel for you
The way I feel, the way I feel
It feels so good it hurts
What you do
The way I feel, the way I feel
Dancin' and we're playin' around
You know you've got me
And then the feelin' comes rainin' down
All over my body
It tingles here, tingles there
Ooh, it tingles everywhere
That's why I've never found
The way to describe it
Ugh, you better ask for forgiveness now
Me and Miley about to rip shit down
And she bored of the misfits
You motherfuckers better hope that I can't fit this crown
And how did we get this sound?
Gotta say thanks to P Willy
Feel it gettin' island tsunami in Hawaii
And the beaches say hey 'cause the Preme Free Willy
I can't describe
The way I feel, the way I feel
Oh, what a high
The way I feel, the way I feel
I just can't put in words
What I feel for you
The way I feel, the way I feel
It feels so good it hurts
What you do
The way I feel, the way I feelUh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
C'mon
I was justified when I was five
Raising Cain, I spit in your eye
Times are changing, now the poor get fat
But the fever's gonna catch you when the bitch gets back 
Eat meat on Friday that's alright
Even like steak on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social do's
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue 
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch
Oh, the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch
'Cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move
The things that I do, oh
Uh, uh, uh
Woah, uh
Oh, oh
I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul by dropping names
I don't like those, my God, what's that?
Oh, it's full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back 
Oh, oh
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch
Oh, the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact

HeyIt ain’t you

Just stop, you’re making it worse
Too hard or too far and you act like it’s all okSnippet:
So let’s go fast I don’t wanna take it slow
Put a ring on it cause I wanna let you know...Last night a little dancer came dancin to my door
Last night a little angel came pumping on the floor
She said, "Come on baby, Ive got a license for love
And if it expires, pray help from above because"
In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour, babe, more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more, more, more, more
She dont like slavery, she won't sit and beg
But when Im tired and lonely, she sees me to bed
What sets you free and brought you to me, babe
What sets you free, I need you here by me because
In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour, babe, more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more
He lives in his own heaven
Collects it to go from the Seven Eleven
Well, hes out all night to collect a fare
Just so long, just so long, it dont mess up his hair
I walked the walk for you, babe
A thousand miles for you
I dried your tears of pain, babe
A million times for you
Id sell my soul for you, babe
For money to burn for you
Id give you all and have none, babe
Just-a, just-a, just-a, just-a
To have you here by me because
In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, she cried more, more, more

Ooh yeah, a little baby, she want more
More, more, more, more, more
Ooh yeah, a little angel, she want more
More, more, more, more, moreJe ne suis jamais venue à la plage
Je ne me suis jamais trouvée au bord de l'océan
Je ne me suis jamais assise près du rivage, sous le soleil, les pieds dans le sable
Mais tu m'as amenée ici, je me réjouis que tu l'aies fait
Parce que là, je suis libre comme l'air, j'ai le vent en poupe
J'ai toujours pensé que je sombrerais, alors je n'ai jamais nagé
Je n'ai jamais fait de bateau, je ne sais pas comment ils flottent
Et parfois, j'ai tellement peur de ce que je ne comprends pas
Mais on est là, tous les deux
À Malibu, le ciel est encore plus bleu
À Malibu tous les deux
Tous les deux
Tout en marchant, on regardait le soleil se coucher
Je passerais bien le reste de ma vie ici à parler
Tu m'expliquerais le courant pendant que j'essaie de sourire
Espérant que je reste simplement la même, et que rien ne change
Et qu'on soit nous, rien qu'un moment
Existe-t-on seulement ?
C'est là que je formule le vœu, sans concession, de partir à la nage avec les poissons
L'été tout entier est censé être aussi chaud ?
Je ne t'aurais jamais cru si tu m'avais dit il y a trois ans
Que je serais ici en train de composer ce morceau
Mais on est là, tous les deux
À Malibu, le ciel est encore plus bleu
À Malibu tous les deux
Tous les deux
On est pareils aux vagues, qui fluent et refluent
Parfois, j'ai l'impression que je me noie
Mais tu es là pour me sauver
Et je veux te remercier du fond du cœur
Tu m'offres un tout nouveau départ, de prometteurs débuts
Un rêve devenu réalité à MalibuI can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life
Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me
I can't find, oh the right romantic line
But see me once  and see the way I feel, oh
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh they need love to help them heal
Ohh
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me
Don't let the sun, the sun...Kiss you goodbye, don't start to cry
Got company
I gotta run, I gotta run
They are after me
It's not about you, ooh
It's not about you, ooh
It's about me
I'm wanted, baby
Most wanted, baby
All these bitches want something from me
Got me fucked up on LA money
Fake-ass fiction saying that they love me, oh
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am
My famous friends forgot again
That everybody dies
What's happening is not what you see
All the pictures lie, yeah
It's not about you, ooh
It's not about you, ooh
It's about me
I'm wantеd, baby
Most wanted, baby
All these bitchеs want something from me
Got me fucked up on LA money
Fake-ass fiction saying that they love me, oh
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am
Hanging out, with the criminals
Got our faces on the billboards
Hanging out, with the criminals
Yeah
All these bitches want something from me
Got me fucked up, got me fucked up, LA money
Fake-ass fiction saying that they love me, oh
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I am
They don't even know who I amSnippet:
I ain’t got no worries when I’m ‘round you cause I always feel...Well, I believe in love, but not the kind of screws you up, no!
I believe in time and chance
'Cause I’m not one for making plans
Well, you’ve go down in history
And that’s just what it is to me
I believe in moving on when sentimental and love is gone
But if I’m crying over you
And I won’t lie, leaving’s hard to do
When you turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means goodbye
I'll see you in another life
I'll see you in another life
I don’t know where I’m going
But when you turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means goodbye
I believe in love, but not the kind of breaks you up, no
I don’t regret the day I fell
Kiss to life, I wish you well
But if I’m crying over you
And I won’t lie, leaving’s hard to do
When you turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means goodbye
I'll see you in another life
I'll see you in another life
I don’t know where I’m going
But when you turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means goodbye
Well, I know you’re full, full of good intentions, yeah
But that doesn’t change a thing 'cause I’m already out of here
Oh-oh-oh
But when you turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means goodbye
I'll see you in another life, yeah oh
I'll see you in another life
I don’t know where I’m going
But when you turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means goodbye, yeah yeah
I'll see you in another life, oh
I'll see you in another life
I don’t know where I’m going
But when you turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means goodbye
I'll see you in another life
I'll see you in another life
I don’t know where I’m going
But when you turn around, I’ll be gone
And that means goodbyeI woke up in Montecito
I was thinking about my life
And the questions made more questions
Staring out into the night
Yes, I've worn the Golden G String
Put my hand into hellfire
I did it all to make you love me
And to feel alive
Oh, that's just the world that we're living in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playing gin
You dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
There are layers to this body
Primal sex and primal shame
They told me I should cover it
So I went the other way
I was trying to own my power
Still I'm trying to work it out
And at least it gives the paper something
They can write about
And oh, that's just the world that we're living in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playing gin
And you dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
So the mad man is in the picture
And it's hard to unvolve
He said "If you can't make ends meet, honey, it must be your fault"
We all focus on the winners
And get blinded by their shine
Maybe caring for each other is just too 1969
But oh, that's just the world that we're living in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playing gin
And you dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away, oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
But I think I'll stay
Too much, you say
But I think I'll stay
I can't walk away
I think I'll stay
Yeah, I think I'll stayAll alone at the end of the evening
And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
Loved me but I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer
I've spent my life running 'round
And it's so hard to change
And I can't seem to settle down
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep turning out and burning out
And turning out the same
So put me on a highway
And show me the sign
And take it to the limit one more time
You can spend all your life making money
And you can spеnd all your love making time
If it all fell to piеces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
And when you're looking for your freedom
But nobody seems to care
And you can't find the door
No, you can't find it anywhere
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back, you're running back
You're coming back for more
So put me on a highway
And show me the signs
And take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
So take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time
Oh just one more timeFeels like I just woke up
Like all this time I've been asleep
Even though it's not who I am
I'm not afraid of who I used to be
No one stays the same
You know what goes up must come down
Change is a thing you can count on
I feel so much younger now
Feels like I've been living in a dream
But never make it to the end
My eyes open when they feel the light
It's always right before I'm about to scream
No one stays the same
You know what goes up must come down
Change is a thing you can count on
I feel so much younger nowOoh
Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go
I want my house in the hills
I want my whiskey and pills
You want a wife and a kid
I don't think I'm down
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us 
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go
I do get drunk and obscene
I'm forever seventeen
You want your castle and queen
I don't think I'm down
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
I want my house in the hills
I want my whiskey and pills 
You want a wife and a kid
I don't think I'm down 
It's time to let it go 
I go crazy 
Slide away 
Back to the ocean, it's time to let it go 
Back to the ocean, it's time to let it go 
Back to the ocean, it's time to let it go 
Back to the ocean, it's time to let it go 
Back to the ocean, it's time to let it go 
Slide away, slide away
It's time to let it go Took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can a child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes bolder children get older
I'm getting older too, well
Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes bolder children get older
I'm getting older too, well, I'm getting older too
So take this love and take it down
Yeah and if you climb a mountain and you turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well, the landslide brought down
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well, maybe, well, maybe, well, maybe
The landslide'll bring you downLook at this stuff
Isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl, the girl who has everything?
Look at this trove
Treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Lookin' around here you'd think
Sure, she's got everything
I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs? I got twenty
But who cares?
No big deal
I want more
I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see 'em dancin'
Walkin' around on those
What to ya call 'em?
Oh, feet!
Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'
Strollin' along down a
What's that word again?
Street
Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free
Wish I could be part of that world
What would I give if I could live outta these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
Betcha on land, they understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Proper women, sick of swimmin', ready to stand
And ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it
What's the word?
Burn
When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be part of that worldI can't seem to focus
And you don't seem to notice I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflection's all alone
I had to go
Can't you hear me?
I'm not comin' home
Do you understand?
I've changed my plans
'Cause I, I'm in love
With my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I, I'm in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself
I know supposedly I'm lonely now
Know I'm supposed to be unhappy
Without someone
But aren't I someone?
And I'd, ooh I'd like to be your answer
'Cause you're so handsome
But I know better
Than to drive you home
'Causе you'd invite me in
And I'd be yours again
But I, I'm in lovе
With my future
And you don't know her
Yeah I, I'm in love
But not with anybody else
I'll see you in a couple yearsMmm, mmm, mmm
Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name, only baby
The more that you give, the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down hell with me
I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la
I'm everything they said I would be
I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you tonight
Your mama says you don't look happy
Close your eyes
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down hell with me
I'm everything they said I would be
La la la
La la la la
La la la
Oh-ah-ah
Ah, oh
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything 
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down hell with me, oh
Angels like you can't fly down hell with meBaby, baby, are you listening?
Oh
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
Baby, can you hear me
When I'm crying out for you?
I'm scared, oh, so scared
But when you're near me
I feel like I'm standing with an army
Of men armed with weapons
Hey, oh
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore youRefrão
Drive my heart into the night
You can drop the keys off in the morning
Cause I don't want to leave home, without your
Love
Without it
Verso - Pablo Nunes
Ahh então deixa eu sonhar
Pois eu quero conquistar
Tocar cada coração, sentir toda emoção
No flow já vou irmão na mente
Mais tatuado de sonho do que Malkaa
Um brinde com a Miley, curtindo mo vibe
A beira-mar
Verso Miley
I thought you would be there when I go
You promised you would be there when I go
But all the broken promises I won't miss
I'm finished
All I know are the facts
That when I look you in the eyes
All I see are the lies
Been there, done that
Refrão
Drive my heart into the night
You can drop the keys off in the morning
Cause I don't want to leave home, without your
Love
Without itSometimes I get a little too hurt
Got my mind going places it ain't wanna go
Sometimes I get a little too loved
And I can't see myself through the fire and smoke
And you, like a neon light
Shining through a door that I can't keep closed
You were like a rolling stone
Always built a city along the rocks that you broke
And in my head, I did my very best singing goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you
But I think that you don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high
Sometimes I stay up all night
'Cause you don't ever talk to me in my dreams
And I think about eventually, you're old to me
And dancing to the record like a moviе scene
And in my head, I did my vеry best singing goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you
But I think that you don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Sometimes I get a little too hurt
Got my mind going places it ain't wanna go
And in my head, I did my very best singing goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you
But I think that you don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel highHello
The sun, it brings the shady people
A crowded room where nobody goes
You can be whoever you wanna be here
And oh, I've been living at the Chateau
Shouldn't drive, but I should really go home
I don't even know 'em, but they won't leave here
Frightened by my own reflection
Desperate for a new connection
Hold you in, but don't you get too close
Love you now, but not tomorrow
Wrong to steal, but not to borrow
Pull you in, but don't you get too close
I've been California dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleeding
Keep me up all night 
Keep me up all night 
Lost in black hole conversations
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night 
Keep me up all night
I just wanna feel 
I just wanna feel something 
But I keep feeling nothing all night long
Hello 
I'll tell you all the people I know 
Sell you something that you already own 
I can be whoever you want me to be
Love me now, but not tomorrow
Fill me up, but leave me hollow
Pull me in, but don't you get too close 
I've been California dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleeding
Keep me up all night 
Keep me up all night 
Lost in black hole conversations
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night 
Keep me up all night
I just wanna feel 
I just wanna feel something 
But I keep feeling nothing all night long
All night long
All night long
All night long
All night long
I've been California dreamin' 
Plastic hearts are bleeding
Keep me up all night 
Keep me up all night 
Lost in black hole conversations
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night 
Keep me up all night
I just wanna feel 
I just wanna feel something 
But I keep feeling nothing, all night longCan stop at the clouds
Watching the world.. spin around
Something looks familiar in the color of the sky
Reminds me of the best thing that I made last night
It's blue at the ocean, as wild as time
I'm home!
In your arms is where I belong
Please don't let me go, thank god that I'm finally home
Here I go again, to where I have been
Now for awhile it feels so damn good
To let off a smile, Can't remember the last that I fell in love
With you skin, touching mine, How I feel so strong
When I look in your eyes, When I look into your soul?
If you don't holding me, I can't breath, I rather die
I'm home!
In your arms is where I belong
Please don't let me go, thank god that I'm finally homeRock Mafia
For those who don't know me, I can get a bit crazy
Have to get my way, yep
24 hours a day, 'cause I'm hot like that
Every guy, everywhere just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection
I always gets a ten, 'cause I'm built like that
I go through guys like money flying out the hands
They try to change me, but they realize they can't
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan
If you're gonna be my man understand
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed
If there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya
I'm not here to sell ya or tell you to go to hell
I'm not a brat like that
I'm like a puzzle, but all of my pieces are jagged
If you can understand this, we can make some magic
I'm wrong like that
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go
I wanna be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode
Baby, by now you should know
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed
Well, I'm not a trick you play
I'm wired a different way
I'm not a mistake, I'm not a fake, it's set in my DNA
Don't change me, don't change me
Don't change me, don't change me
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go
I wanna to be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode
Baby, by now you should know
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamedSnippet:
You’re just mad cause your hair is flat, your record’s wack and you seem to attract
You’re just mad cause you’re fake as fuck, with your big old titties and a big old butt
I hope you know I like being a slut, and when you said I got a Justin Bieber cut
I know I’m 100 and I know I’m fresh, here’s a mint, use it on your bread
You said...Thank you guys so much
This next song, I think you guys might know
It's a little song called "Best of Both Worlds"
I wanna hear you singin' along, oh yeah
C'mon
You get the limo out front 
Hottest style, every shoe, every color
Yeah, when you're famous it can be kinda fun
It's really you, but no one ever discovers
In some ways, you're just like all your friends
But on stage, you're a star
You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together
And you know that it's the best of both worlds
The best of both worlds, yeah
You go to movie premieres 
Hear your songs on the radio
Livin' two lives is a little weird, yeah
But school's cool, 'cause nobody knows
Yeah, you get to be a small town girl
But big time when you play your guitar
You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together
And you know that it's the best of both—
You know the best of both worlds
Pictures and autographs
You get your face in all the magazines 
The best part is that
You get to be whoever you wanna be
Best! Best! Yeah, the best of both—
Best! Best! You got the best of both—
Best! Best! C'mon, the best of both—
Who would've thought that a girl like me
Would double as a superstar?
You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together
And you know that it's the best—
You get the best of both worlds
Without the shades and the hair
You can go anywhere
You get the best of both girls
Mix it all together, oh yeah
It's so much better
'Cause you know you got the best of both worlds
Thank you, everybody!Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted I, bought them for you
Graceless lady, you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away
I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Can make me feel bitter or treat you unkind
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away
I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom, but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken
Tears must be cried
Let's do some living after we die
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses we'll ride them some day
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses we'll ride them some dayOne minute I'm in Central Park
Then, I'm down on Delancey Street
Said, from the Bowery to St Mark's
There’s a syncopated beat. Right
I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
I'm streetwise
I can improvise
I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
I'm street-smart
I've got New York City heart
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
I may not have a dime
But I got street savoir faire
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just been-BO population
And I got street savoir faire
The rhythm of the city
But once you get it down
Said, then you can own this town
You can wear the crown!
Why should I worry? Tell me
Why should I care?
I Said, I may not have a dime. Oh!
But I got street savoir faire
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just doo-population
And I got street savoir faire
Everything goes
Everything fits
They love me at the Chelsea!
They adore me at the Ritz!
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
And even when I cross that line
I got street savoir faire
I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whooFeels like I just woke up
Like all this time I've been asleep
Even though it's not who I am
I'm not afraid of who I used to be
No one stays the same
You know what goes up must come down
Change is a thing you can count on
I feel so much younger now
Feels like I've been living in a dream
But never make it to the end
My eyes open when they feel the light
It's always right before I'm about to scream
No one stays the same 
You know what goes comes back around 
Change is a thing you can count on 
I feel so much younger now 
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down
So much younger now
So much younger nowSnippet:
Hey
Gotta go, yeah I’m trying out my laces
You can’t come cause we’re going different places
Adios we can never be the same...
