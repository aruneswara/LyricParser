Get the fuck out the way , must be this high to play 
It must be nice up above the lights and what a lovely life that I made, yeah 
I know that feelin' like it's in my family tree, yeah 
That Mercedes drove me crazy, I was speedin'
Somebody save me from myself, yeah
Tell them they can take that bullshit elsewhere
Self care, we gonna be
Good
Hell yeah
They lettin' me go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o

Out
I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know, I didn't know
Yeah, well
Didn't know what I was missin', now I see a lil' different
I was, thinkin' too much, got stuck in oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, oblivion, yeah, yeah
I got all the time in the world, so for now I'm just chillin'
Plus I know it's a, it's a beautiful feelin'
In oblivion, yeah, yeah, oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah
Yeah, okay, I ride around my city when I come home, yeah
The sun set quickly then get up slow, yeah
I disconnect and upload
Watch it spin around, we just spin it round, yeah
Let's go and travel through the unknown, yeah
We play it cool, we know we fucked though, yeah
You keep on sayin' you in love, so
Tell me, are you really down? Are you really down? Yeah
Let's go back to my crib and play some 45's
It's safer there, I know there's still a war outside
We spend our nights all liquored up, our mornings high
Can you feel it now?
Oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I got
All the time in the world, so for now I'm just chillin'
Plus, I know it's a, it's a beautiful feelin'
In oblivion, yeah, yeah, oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeahI spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring cleanin'
I'm always too busy dreamin'
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret, but I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Oh, I hate the feelin'
When you're high, but you're underneath the ceilin'
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealin', yeah
Get everything I need, then I'm gone, but it ain't stealin'
Can I get a break?
I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
Well, maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always tryin' to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm sayin' it about
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?
When it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm runnin' out of gas, hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
Well, so tired of bein' so tired
Why I gotta build somethin' beautiful just to go set it on fire?
I'm no liar, but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it, yeah
It's what I do
If you know me, it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's the problem with a closed door
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?
There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side
I'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
I'll finally discover
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad, ain't so bad
Well, it ain't that bad, mm
At least it don't gotta be no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hey, hey
Mm, hey, mm, mm, mmYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, now
I got a little bit of money fillin' my pockets, roll around like I run this shit
I got a system filled up with toxins, I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch
Getting high to deal with my problems, fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit
But these bitches getting obnoxious, they nuttin' to me though, I love this shit
Go long days, longer nights, talk too much, the wrong advice, all the lights
And call my life, doctor, doctor, will you help me? Get me healthy, keep it low, this where hell be
Ain't shit you can tell me now, fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new bitch, you jealous now, smokin' weed at the crib watching Belly now 
All the pain that they causin' like, fuck it, we ballin', now everythin' straight
You feeling the feeling, I'm chilling, just living, I'm burning away
Conversations we having, I'm getting too static, too much on my plate
Lord, I need me a break
But I'll be good by the weekend  
I'll be good by the weekend 
Everything good by the weekend  
Everything will be good by the weekend 
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight, like fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight, fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight 
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight 
I been having trouble sleeping, battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing: is it money, fame or neither?
I been thinking about the places that I frequent, all the people that I see
I’m just out here livin' decent, what do it mean to be a G? Yeah 
And all the time we fall behind, bitches in the concubine, I call her mine, crazy
She ain't God as I, I make water wine, pausin' time, it's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line, I cross the T's and dot the I's, wondering, well
Wonderin' how I got this high, fell asleep and forgot to die, Goddamn
I'm poppin' them downers and drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter, I'm stuck on the browser, like, how did I make it?
These bitches don't know me, this shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what the day is
But I'll be good by the weekend  
I'll be good by the weekend 
Everything good by the weekend  
Everything will be good by the weekend 
Mondays I think of you, but I ain’t tripping on it
Tuesdays I’m hittin', gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I'm lit wit'chu, you know you're staying over
Thursdays I’m sick of you, I got to get rid of you
'Cause Fridays are always the start of the time of
My life, alright
When I get faded you hate it, but, baby
It’s gon' be alright
Haha, alrightCan you turn the beat up?
A little louder
There you go
People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinkin' 'bout her all the time
I never seen somebody put together perfectly
What would I have to do to call you mine?
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes, or you can walk in blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear-view
Let's leave it all in the rear-view, girl
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry
Mend a broken heart, girl, if you can
I don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
That responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm havin' some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shootin' stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did I think I'm still myself
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear-view
Let's leave it all in the rear-view, girl
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cryYeah
Eric
Well
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
Yeah, okay, you gotta jump in to swim
Well, the light was dim in this life of sin
Now every day I wake up and breathe
I don't have it all but that's all right with me
Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me
Send you back home with a light that's beamin'
The whole team 'bout to figure it out
We ice cold, that's what winter about
And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route
Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhmm
Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out, yeah
Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money
Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
I was yea high and muddy
Lookin' for what was lookin' for me
But I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
Yeah, they ask me what I'm smilin' for
Well, because I've never been this high before
It's like I never felt alive before
Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind than war
See, me and you, we ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'
Take my time to finish, mind my business
A life ain't a life 'til you live it, I was diggin' me a hole
Big enough to bury my soul
Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own
My own, with these arms I can carry you home
I'm right here when you scared and alone, and I ain't never in a hurry
You don't ever gotta worry
Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold
See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job
But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
Now when it gets hard
I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm
Because I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more

Rap diablo
Yeah, yeah
It's the rap diablo, macho when I drop flows
Bar gets raised up, it's me and Petey Pablo
Colder than gazpacho, colder than the mono
Rappin' head honcho, rocking shows like I was Bono
I go play a couple keys on the piano
The industry a lie, all the promises were hollow
Follow me I could show you where we be's at
How'd I get my g-pass? None of your fuckin' beeswax
These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
Fuck the little 8 balls, show me where the ki's at
The time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish 'em
Tryna find a balance, reachin' from my equilibrium
Fools I pity 'em, I'm not a human
I'm amphibian, fake superhero like the Mystery Men
I ain't saving nothin'
I'm gettin' faded 'til the angels comin', skippin' all the famous functions
How do the famous function? The A-list can't be trusted
I strong-arm 'em like I play the trumpet
The bottom barrel of society, I tell my bitch
If she don't love me then just lie to me, I'm finer than the winery
Take it from the rich, this is piracy 
Finally, I don't even need my fucking eyes to see
Come and die with me
'Cause everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Yeah, said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Yeah, um
Okay, my mind is Yoda, I'm on Ayatollah
These other rappers just a diet soda
I find Jehovah in the darkest places, empty as apartment basements
This a marathon gentlemen, go 'head and start the races
Save the coffin spaces
You'll come up missin', tell your bitch that you been trippin', now you on vacation
Rappin' like it's automated, lights I keep 'em on like Vegas
Lava makin', so hot I'm turning hog to bacon
Only God can save him, I heard the monsters made him
I ain't a star, I'm way farther with the constellations
Contemplatin' suicide like it's a DVD
Lost inside my mind, it's a prison, homie, leave me be
You can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks
Bitch, I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke
Gordon Bombay in these streets, ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete
Been a beast, every word I spit rewritin' history
Look at what you did to me, look at what you did to me
Run into the underworld with guns and set the sinners free
No bitches in my circle, I'm the show, you the commercial
I been poppin' like a kernel, readin' Justin Bieber's journal
Treat you like a urinal
'Cause everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Yeah, said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homiesMy regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head
In my own way, this feel like livin'
Some alternate reality
And I was drownin', but now I'm swimmin'
Through stressful waters to relief
Yeah, oh, the things I'd do
To spend a little time in Hell
And what I won't tell you
I'll prolly never even tell myself
And don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
When you inside all day
I wish it was nice out, but it look like rain
Grey skies are driftin', not livin' forever
They told me it only gets better
My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my headI don't know why, but I think that he makes me smile
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love
Said, you know I know who you really are, ain't need to lie
Said, the universe couldn't keep us apart
Why would it even try?
Yeah, said, don't let them hurt you ever
I know you far too smart
Before things come together, they have to fall apart
It's been a while since I've been sober
This life can be so hard, I'd rather talk about you
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part 
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love, yeah, yeah
If you wanna stay, we're taking it slow, baby
'Cause you want me, and I got enough on my mind
But I can make some time for something so divine, oh, yeah
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into loveHey
Ayo, Sap! What's good, bruh?
This man's kinda high out here *Laughs*
Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him 'cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon
For now, I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say, "fuck it"
'Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear 'em talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit? 
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe, we gon' win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap
Uh, uh, uh
And ma'fuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring her friends
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me, then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly
But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe, we gon' win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrapI never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see: Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
'Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
'Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney, boy, my family Proud
Make 'em say, "Ow," make 'em say, "Oh"
The hoes that tell me "Yes," the same ones that tell ya "No"
Whoa, I ain't just an Average Joe, way above the average flow
Boy, my life is Most Dope, uh
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughin' like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek, ayy, ayy
And I ain't gonna wait for nothin'
'Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This gon' be the best day ever
If it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half-insane, and with the lames I see you hatin'
But there's nothin' that you changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin', I'll be in another zone
Move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Find a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Thumbs up, homie, I'll be sure
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughin' like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek, ayy, ayy
And I ain't gonna wait for nothin'
'Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This gon' be the best day everYeah, yeah
I can't keep on
Losin' you over complications
Gone too soon, wait!

The key that I won't forget, too soon
I can't keep on losin' you
I can't keep on losin' you
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
How many mistakes do it take 'til you leave
And I'm left with my hand on my face, all red
In the face, lookin' at you like "wait!"
I know I ain't a saint, if it ain't too late, well...
 Don't run away so fast
Know my heart like gold, but it break like glass
Know my shit get old and I act so young
Baby, you so cold, never have no sun
You don't wanna grow up, yeah, that shit no fun
So when I get home, I'ma give you some
Make you feel like  when I hit that drum
Yeah, the dick ain't free, I don't give no fucks
Yeah, it's complicated, got you frustrated
Get home late and you don't trust me, baby
Way too drunk, you don't know what I'm sayin'
You can drive my car, don't drive me crazy
Complicated, got you frustrated
Every single night I keep you waitin'
You say you don't care, that's what you sayin'?
We both know that's some bullshit
Okay, we be fightin', we be reunitin'
Kiss me, touch me, tease me, me excited

Play your games like they my ticket to an Ivy League school
Won't get Hall of Fame dick from a minor league dude
I just eat pussy, other people need food 
Only got a little time and I ain't tryna spend it
Arguin' about who ain't givin' who attention
Startin' up the engine, need to reboot
I just eat pussy, other people need food
And I use every bone in my body
Keep on holdin' on to your trust
I know you don't want nuttin' to do with me
But just one more time, let's make love
One more time, it ain't much, fuck 'em all, let's be us
Summer's soft sweetness
Call late drunk, you hang up
What a mess I made us, sense, I make none
It's complicated, keepin' me up late
Can't concentrate, you're always on my brain
If it's love, then why the fuck it come with pain?
I just think that's some bullshit
Okay, it seem invitin', trust me, she's a titan
This week she like him, next week they fightin'

Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
WooUh, close your eyes
So watch her do the Macarena, somewhere out by Pasadena
Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waster of the space that you take up
Livin', this time around I'm not kiddin'
I had an intuition 'bout these women and suspicion
Got me lookin' at shit different, how a man in my position
Can't start slippin' down these slopes 'cause it's all just downhill from there
As a kid I didn't learn that, but now I'm aware
When you a youngin' you just tryna live your life and have some fun in
A world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep 'em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids
You had the world, you 'bout to leave it to these young kids
And we gon' show you what the love is...
Stay high
Go for what you know
Let it in your mental
And don't ever let it go
It won't stop!
You can't fight the feeling

You can't fight the feeling, no
It won't stop!
You can't fight the feeling

You can't fight the feeling, no
Uh
And I keep a couple Most Dope homies by me
So there ain't too many times it's me, myself and Irene
We stay smokin' through the night, wake up, do some tai-chi
Homie, can't you see I'm chillin'? Please don't fuck up my chi
Yeah, my jacket Y-3, recently been up on fashion
Waste a bunch of money, kinda stinks of satisfaction
Fell asleep at Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan
Ballin' like I'm Jordan, but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on a idea, we never can agree
They tell you what to know, but it's better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Still I tell em, "Fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable"
Just continue livin' life, 'cause enough of 'em don't
You spent your days countin' every single penny made
Restart now, 'cause we comin' for you anyways
Stay high
Go for what you know 
Let it in your mental 
And don't ever let it go
It ain't never gon' stop, 'cause
You can't fight the feeling
 Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
Uh, I told you it won't stop, 'cause
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make her
Wrap this much make-up off my bed, soon as she's yawnin', take up
Hours upon days just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre, I mean
The sun is slowly fallin', we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh, you left your phone behind?
Identity crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless
My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open of oceans
That coast the line on the margins I rhyme, you chokin' or soakin' up game
I'm hopin' you picked the second one, shame
The emotion of jealousy that you're holdin', you're tellin' me
That you're golden but really cubic zirconia, let me see
I'll break you down like a pound of fire, whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you're Mayweather you

Why you tryna stunt, you need to play your own position
Never gave a fuck, yeah, nothin' 'bout me changed
Still roll up them blunts, got diamonds in my chain, haha
Yeah, you heard me I got diamonds in my chain
And it don't make a difference if you cryin' in the rain
Two hundred shows, I'ma kill more, I just sold out that Fillmore
Got a million, make a mill' more, then a number one spot on the Billboard
Yeah, people lie, numbers won't, keep me high, drugs is close
Roll one up, pour a cup, watch the world go up in smoke
I like my music real loud, real loud

Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low

Here she comes, there she goes, never chasin' after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
Argh
I'ma get that Grammy soon, fuck your magazine
Jordan gonna hand me shoes, still fuck your magazine
Hammer team in that pack with me, hear the Jerm beat banging, with a glass of lean
When I went to every high school class would be tryna fuck the female faculty
I'm a crazy little fucker, think my head done ran away
I experiment with drugs but I won't ever fuck with yay'
I just made a million dollars, still I think I'm underpaid
Fuck with me? Kid no way, when you meet me, bitch stand up straight
Pump out raps, yeah, I got raps, tryna talk shit, what you think about that?
For the pesos, getting bank roll, I'ma lay low, chill, 'til I let that stack

Here she comes, there she goes, never chasin' after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets lowYeah
Haha
Uh, think I can see a fuckin' halo , about to meet my maker
Brought a double cup of Drano , some soda for the flavor
Uncontrollable behavior with some psychopathic tendencies
Lonely as your neighbor with the bitches, he got special needs 
Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy
My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe 
They got my soul, but I don't let 'em take the rest of me
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly
And my denim tailored , me and Action rappin'
Al be fuckin' with the fader , sippin' mind eraser
Actually, we rappin' for the fuck of it
Takin' money from you, gonna smack you out in public
You the Republican government
Abundance of substance, have a consumption to fuck a bitch 
With your Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick
And your bitch lookin' like Cousin Itt, the ugliest
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit 
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty-fifth
Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit
Lookin' up into the clouds where the angels sit
They lookin' down, keepin' watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head? 
Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first 
After rappin', take my people out for octopus 
We all deserve it; dedication to the fam 
Don't hold your hand out for nothin' if you claim to be my man, damn
You see me peelin' off a whip like when your mother strip 
Blow the dice, roll them shits, hit another trip 
Shit, I'm on some shit
Hands are fuckin' hotter than the leather in the six in the summertime 
Understand I'm only rhymin' for this son of mine
And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
We ate the tuna, it's suede Puma
My look is Jay Buhner, doggy, ‘cause some of us just age sooner 
I'm still twisted, rockin' lizards from a strange river 
Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver
Check the bio 
I fixed the game between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio, I been wild
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit 
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty fifth
Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinkin' crazy shit
Lookin' up into the clouds where the angels sit
They lookin' down, keepin' watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head? 
Uh, uh
Bitch, I'm noddin' off, I'm hot as wasabi sauce
And constantly givin' y'all a bit of this ambiance
I was a minor chasin' after vagina
None of my friends were fake, but none of my clothes designer
Went from posted on stoops  to smokin' on roofs 
I came from that basement, now look at this view 
Makin' this money , blowin' it all 
Fuck what you did , just show me results 
Yo, I'm a 635 dipper, fly motherfucker
Leather to the foot, horses, I led 'em to the brook
If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book
I see a lion in the mirror when I look
Look, I lose money, but I make it back
I keep it true and ain't no motherfuckin' fakin' that
I get a fade and then I fade to black
Bet on the Razorbacks, I hold the multi-colored flavored gat
Blat!
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
You was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
This name says "Crack dealin' trap nigga slash cap peeler
Back with a black stripper
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker, too fat to snap zippers"
In half is what I'll do to Mac Miller
Now my mind's first track figured
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixir, taps liquor
Then pass 'til it goes around the room, like his casket finna
Oh, you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
You-hoo! I'm finna murder this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure that look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you "beastie," boy
You can't match a killer with that, wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Thriller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from, Malcolm
I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King
You're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were struckin' blows, bloody nose for your honey roll
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You a bully's best day ever, with them Nike's on your feet
Comin' through Blue Slide Park
I'm gon' rob this chump
On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump
Nigga, give me that shit!
I liked you better when you was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?Yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Yeah-yeah
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Well, okay
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same 
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
 Shame on you 
Everything is strange  that's just a game 
Everybody trippin'  throwin’ it away 
We was gettin' lifted, now we gettin' paid
Shame on you 
A—a'ight, a'ight
I paid the cost to see apostrophes
That means it's mine  keep to myself, takin' my time 
Always into some bullshit, and outta line
Drivin' with my eyes closed, missin' all the signs
Turn the ignition, I'm driven and sittin' pretty 
Listenin' to Whitney and whippin' it through the city, yeah 
Man on a mission, figure it out
Puttin' way too much on my shoulders, please hold me down 
I keep my head above the water 
My eyes gettin' bigger, so the world is gettin' smaller 
I be gettin' richer but that only made me crazy
Mama told me I was different even when I was a baby
That Mercedes through the P.A. when I pull up , soundin' like a concert
Or a  monster truck, I'm trippin' but I'm fallin' up
Always said I want it all, but it's not enough
Well, o-kay 
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same 
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
 Shame on you 
And everything is strange  that's just a game 
Everybody trippin'  throwin’ it away 
We was gettin' lifted, now we gettin' paid
Shame on you 
We only just begun
No, we don't wanna hurt your feelings
'Cause it’s only just begun
No, we don't wanna
Hurt  feelings 
Down go the system, long live the king 
Turn the power off and get your water from the spring 
I'm bringing everyone with me when shit get iffy 
I give a hundred and fifty percent
This is the shit that I'm dealing with, but I wish I'd forget
Used to be feelin' depressed, now that I'm livin' I'm a little obsessed, yes
High in Jacuzzis, I be hittin' the jets
I'm showing her some love she been givin' me sex 
Respect to Adonai
Don't fuck around and be a victim of your pride, why you lyin'?
 Tell the truth, just step aside
I don't got the time to let it slide 
I'm too grounded, push whips that move mountains
New cribs, blue fountains, these are my surroundings
I've been going through it, you just go around it
But it's really not that different when you think about it
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same 
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
 Shame on you 
And everything is strange  that's just a game 
Everybody trippin'  throwin’ it away 
We was gettin' lifted, now we gettin' paid
Shame on you 
Hurt
FeelingsHallelujah, thank God I have a future
Prayin' I don't waste it gettin' faded
'Cause I'm smokin' *censored* until I'm coughin' up tar
Feel the surge, energy curve like a lumbar
I don't act hard, I still read Babar
Trippin' out, lookin' at a bunch of Google map stars
Shit, they got a app for... that
But me, I'm still trapped inside my head
It kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm livin' paradise, so what I have to worry 'bout?
Dealin' with these demons, feel the pressure
Find the perfect style 
Makin' sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
And I experience a touch of my epiphany in color form
Difference between love and war inform me, I'm above the norm 
Give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts
Rhymin' like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed
I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice
And I don't know what I'm runnin' from, but I'm runnin' still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothin' real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fuckin' deal 
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil
But I want that Rolls-Royce that the homie Lennon drove
So, if you don't talk about some money, I'ma send you home
Unconventional, special but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's lettin' me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity, I let 'em go 
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow 
That's just me all wildin' out and bein' extra though 
Yeah
And if God was a human, it'd be yours truly
Watchin' horror movies with some foreign groupies
Thinkin' this decor suits me 
I do drugs, get more loopy
I'm in tune to ancient jujitsu spirituals, it's blissful 
Lookin' out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet 
I think I'm JFK's final speech, they try assassinatin' all of my beliefs
 So whisper to me for the peace of mind
And he be high, some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine 
Twenty thousand on my watch 'cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine 
Yeah, can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now, it's just not the same 
I'm lookin' out my window, ashin' on the pane 
Shit, wonder if I lost my way 
Yeah, don't you ever wanna hide away? 
Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today 
I'll greet the devil with a smilin' face 
Shit, that God fellow may reside in space
As, times are wastin', I'm freebasin' with Freemasons
My girl's switchin' the locks, the keys keep changin' 
Dreamin' of places, my own personal creations
If there's a party in Heaven I plan to leave wasted 
Retracin' my steps way back to Biblical times
We-we all gon' end up meetin' at the finishin' line
And these words that I command you today shall be in your heart
And you shall teach them diligently to your children
And you shall speak of them when you sit at home
And when you walk along the way, and when you lie down
And when you rise up, I am the lord, your god]
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it take
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day
Can't stop, then you won't stop
I know just how that feel
When you're on top, 'til the ball drop
You've never seen it be so real
It feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day
Feel it a little, feel it a lot
I'm swimmin' a bit, but deeper in thought
Keepin' my head on top of my shoulders
Into some shit, I'm out of the box
This the level I'm on
Needin' it all right now, when forever is gone
Baby, the weather is strong
Whether it's hot or cold
I'm comin', knockin' on yo' door
Well, I'ma, I'ma maintain how I'm stayin' so high
Put the ladder all the way up 'til we touchin' the sky
And you know you're dead wrong, you're in love with a lie
All I, all I, all I wanna do is free yo' mind
We don't see no lines, we don't color inside
It's a very small world, we don't fuck with the size
Yeah, see the bigger picture when it's beneficial
Lovin' how I catch you
Blow the whistle when you run out of time
Yeah, wakin' up, I open up my eyes
Do you mind if I blow yo' mind?
A little closer, baby, don't be shy
Why you worried that it's gon' be fine?
I guess it's that kinda day
It's really all I'm tryna say
We don't have a lot of time to waste
Somehow we gotta find a way
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day
I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot yo' shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got
Yeah, yeah
All the- lights flickerin', hittin' the right switches
I'm livin' this life different and missin' the flight bullshittin'
I had a plan to change, you can't stand the rain
Little delayed, but I came and you cool wit' it
I don't trip, flip or lose my grip
And I don't know it all, but I do know this
Before you know me, better know self
I've been in this shit so long that it don't smell
I turn the hotel to a castle
Livin' like a king for a grand
I don't do nothin', that's a hassle
Besides, even that castle made of sand
Just might slip into the sea
Fuck it all, if it all ain't me
Maybe we inside the maze
Somehow we gotta find a way, okay
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day
I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot yo' shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we gotYeah mane, you know I'm smokin' at the beginnin' of the song, man, like a damn... rapper. Ah man, man, it's crazy bein' so rich, man, damn
In '09, we were still on the bus, nigga
Before Nak was deluxe, when I didn't have a brush
When there still wasn't hoes tryna fuck with me
'Fore I cleaned up a bit like it's company comin'
I ain't know we was on the cusp of the money
Tryna get a few bucks under custody
And my twin brothers was all Syd's brothers
So my kin gully and my skin toughened
Thick lens coverin' my eyes now
They ain't bright, nigga, I'm just high now
And if this a different way to clear my mind out
I need to find out, I'm doin' fine now
And I don't look as stupid when I talk now
And everybody at the show look astounded
Posted up drowsy
In the cut so much that it's pus 'round me
Catch him in the daytime or dusk hours
Smokin' out the pound, houndin' mutts out it
If your tucks lousy then you can't sit with us 
Can't call it harsh livin' when the margin
Between you and all these fuck niggas is about as large as it gets
And you workin', givin' arm and a leg
Say he workin' but he just talkin' 'cause he ain't workin'
Like a long-distance bitch
Who you know that's out that's harder than this?
Chargin' niggas like a Tomlison win, nigga
Slight frown on the brow on the brim, color brown
Runnin' wild on the route that was picked
When the clouds branch out
And I'm out with my face in the shallow end, drownin' again
I could drown you with a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
Drugs got me feelin' like Vigo Carpathian
Just look at the state he's in, yo, yo
The most critically acclaimed, slang contortionist
That ain't suckin' corporate dick
Said it with my balls in grip
Other hand got a cork to hit
All this Ralph be the sportsmanship
Walked in and said I needed all the chips
As well as the one on my shoulder
Feel like my heart got pneumonia, blunt laced, covered in odor
Cops still lockin' niggas up for quotas
Brain still numb from the shit in the soda, so
A generation lost
Facin' a Paul Allen in vacant loft
Warrants bein' filed for the cases fought
And them drugs get obtained by debatin' cost
You ain't Superman when that cape is off
Just Clark, nigga, sittin' in his high-rise
Tryna see the bright side of life
And a nigga just keep comin' back with a dark picture
It's like hard liquor, and see people are books
So you judge a ma'fucka by the first page
And a bitch by the back cover
The crime is long-sleeved, so the tats covered
Real ones, I'm the last brother, when they see me on stage
They said my shit was so insane
It was like Cobain did his last number
Motherfucker
I could drown you with a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul 
Shallow soul , shallow soul 
Yeah, well
Isn't he dizzy off the ups and downs
He got a lil' Whitney, put it in a blunt for now 
Shit was s'posed to get me high
Why the fuck I wanna die now?  and I'm
Strung out on this dusty couch
In a big white ugly house, I tell the bitch, "Slow down
 Stop runnin' your mouth
You holdin' my money, just shut up and count," my  
Right nostril hasn't worked in a week
Plus the plug got work, like he servin' for a sheik
Me, I'm swervin' in a Jeep
Burnin' weed, doin' circles in the street  yellin'
"Play my shit or wake the baby up!” 
I get her faded, put it back in her labia
All my life I've been afraid of powder
All my life I've been afraid of power, where did all that go?
The wrong decision always call my phone 
Last supper I was fuckin' with the Corleones 
I need somethin' stronger than a cortisone
That can save me from the war I know
Shout out to Soulo , and rest in peace Alori Joh
The devil on the other side of this glory hole 
Any time, any place, you can bet I'ma eat
'Cause my hand on the fork and the fork in the road 
Whoa, look at all these new faces
I see, I see, I see
They comin' on a plane but they're leavin' their suitcases
Been a criminal before scales were digital
Used the put the weed in the sole of my blue Asics  )
Hate myself, fuck the strangers 
But the raps are just way too flagrant, so
Here I go 
Throwin' up a prayer, it's a Hail Mary
 ) I've never been religious
But I feel like the scripture's got it all there
It's not just gypsies and fairies  this could be my last breath
 I'ma take my time
'Cause I'ma go out the same way I came in:
Right by the pussy with nothin' on my mind
You are standing in a shallow soul
You are speaking with a shallow soul
Shallow soul
I could drown you with a shallow soul
Tell me why I'm so lonely
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinking from a shallow soul
Tell myself I'm free
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are standing in a shallow soul
"Uh, I've been without sleep for 80 hours so I'm beyond simple fatigue."I'm thinkin' maybe I should thank you
Oh, baby, I should buy you another round
'Cause you care, and I swear that I'm here, but I'm there
It's gettin' harder to hunt me down
Get away to a place with a lake, such a great view
Leave the bank, couple hunnid thou'
I made it, but I hate once I build it, I break it
That might just break me down
And all I ever needed was somebody with some reason who can keep me sane
Ever since I can remember, I've been keepin' it together, but I'm feelin' strange
Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws, they go missin'
It's likely they might be, but...
You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design
You, despite bein' an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs
Down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down
Down, down, down
Yeah, well, I'm just being honest, my conscience ain't doin' bad
Because I try to minus the problems that I attract
And half the time, the wheels that's in the back of my mind
Just keep on turnin' 'til the tires flat and burn until the fire crack
I do not lie, though, facts may seem a little farfetched
That's only 'cause I may be make-believe and full of darkness
When I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
Walkin', droppin' change inside your empty guitar case
That's charity, um, I move carelessly, that's why I'm always trippin'
I guess it's like electrolytes, you help me go the distance
Not too efficient, but the way it's always been
Until the day we have to meet again
Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws, they go missin'
It's likely they might be, but...
You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design
You, despite bein' an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs
Down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down
Down, down, downAhem, ahem
Good evening everybody
How's everybody doing?
Just wanna ask you a question, um, have you, have you
Have you been in love, before?
You like your vodka with a little touch of lime
You should pro'bly take your heels off, 'cause you been runnin' through my mind
Oh baby, they say we're no good for each other
And I can't really tell, what is this spell you put me under?
Your love's not too kind to me
I hate the pain, these days of rain
You playin' games of hide and seek, my love
And I'm still tryna find you, I'm lookin' for you, babe
And I'm still tryna find you, through sunshine or rain
]
I love you
Yeah
You got your stained glass iris, diamond behind your eyelids
Autopilot fly, my heart skip a beat like a scratched CD
Your skin smell like butterscotch and your lips taste like kiwi
Let's take a plane to Fiji, make a date, let's take it easy
Love is power, swear there's somethin' 'bout her that make me nervous
Mother Earth done gave us all a gift, she made you perfect
Let's eat some mushrooms and go to the circus
Girl, you know I'm lovin' you just like you deserve it 
So, baby, make me earn it, show me the way you work it
Tell me what you afraid of, I'll spit you my favorite verses
Let's... just go take a breath
I want it all, every ounce of love that you got left
You are my drug, in love to death, feel free to fall, you are a catch
I'm in your heart, I'm in your dream, so fuck the world, it's you and me
She is the only one that got away
If her love don't last forever then forever ain't the same, yeah
Your love is not too kind to me
You know my love is sugar-sweet, yeah
The only thing on my mind is she
You think about you, I've been thinking of me
My love, my love
My love, my love, yeah
And I know that nothin' lasts forever 
Nothin' lasts forever
Yeah
And she is cool, calm and collected, I knew that you was the one
When I seen ya, leave me breathless, a-okay, I need a second
Day-to-day, give me attention, I want to take care of you
Marry you, somethin' I'm prepared to do, there can't be two
You was here, I ran from you, scared to take that step
But now that I am ready, you not, you up and left me
Hope your new man make you laugh like I do
I do not mean to worry you with my obsession, I just want to be beside you
I'm too nice, and I had to pay that price
Everything I do is wrong  everything you do is right 
Let's start a family, hold on to forever, baby
Your pussy is a palace and your head is crazy *Woman moans*
That bomb is detonating, look at this mess you're making
I am the king, you are the queen, look at this chess we're playing
Oh we had a love, that love was record-breaking
I'm sick of waitin', yeah
Your love is not too kind to me
You know my love is sugar-sweet, yeah
The only thing on my mind is she
You think about you, I've been thinking of me
My love, my love
My love, my love, yeah
And I know that nothing lasts forever 
Nothing lasts forever, ever, ever
So gimme all of your love
And I will be yours, through rain and through shine
Gimme all of your love
You will be mine through rain and through shine
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeahYup, yup
Yup
Uh
I hope you're proud of me, dude I grew to be
Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
Going through memories like they were movie scenes
I know I been the shit, all these people full of me
I admit, I guess I'm full of myself, too
There's just a bunch of shit, I wish I could tell you, but
This life move fast, I never knew that
Yours wouldn't have lasted, the dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stop
For now, I need to run to any place that a train stops
And everybody wanna talk to me about some business shit
Never really listening, couldn't get real interested
My days gettin' darker, so the haze get sparked up
All this hate sound the same when my name get brought up
You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up
So I could meet your son and talk you up
I remember
When we were just kids
We knew nothing at all
And we would talk about the life we lived in
West Virginia
Lost somewhere out in
West Virginia
It's a
Dark sign when your friends start dyin'
Like, "How could he go? He was part-lion"
Life goes on, the tears all dried and
Couple years are gone by by then, uh
Can you please help me find my friend?
I give you anything you need multiplied by 10
I heard he moved to a place where the time don't end
So you don't need money, all you got is time to spend
Yeah, life's short, don't ever question the length
It's cool to cry, don't ever question your strength
I recommend no limits, intricate thought
Go 'head, just give it a shot, you'll remember shit you forgot
'Cause way back then I didn't know shit
And I don't know shit now
When the world's lookin' hopeless
I'ma still hold shit down
I remember
When we were just kids
We knew nothing at all
And we would talk about the life we lived in
West Virginia

What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out

What's the use?
Never superficial, you gon' know it when it hit you
Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice
Yeah
Okay, we're colder than the breeze
But the breeze ain't flowin' like me, motherfucker, hol' up
You don't need to hol' up, yeah
And I can show you how I seem
What it is, what it truly might be, nothin' that you know of
You don't need to hol' up
I'm so a-bove and beyond
You take drugs to make it up way up where we on
Space shuttle, Elon
Time, we don't waste much, fuck when we wake up
Then I have her sing just like Céline Dion
Catch me if you can but, you'll never catch me, damn
Whole lotta, "Yes, I am"
All the way in wit' no exit plan
Already left and the jet don't land
Yeah, the time is tickin', come take a ride, get inside
This is highly different, I'm talkin' fly, got a pilot wit' 'im, uh
Can I mind my business?
Why you trippin'? Give you somethin' that your eyes can witness

Get a  little  senti-  -mental when I'm off the juice 
Well, I'ma give you what you came for, yeah
Shit, I've worked too hard to have a clue who you are
Set the bar so far above par, we can parlay all day
Crib long range with the yard
I know I should probably pray more but you gotta love me
'Cause I save the day, spend money
When I had nothin', shit, it wasn't so funny
Made a promise to the homies nobody go hungry
Look how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my name
But it never worry my brain
Heads turnin' like a hurricane swervin'
Tell the sun, "Get up outta my shade"
If they don't get the picture, cut 'em outta that frame, shit
I'm up thirty thou' miles plus change
It's been a while but I'm down 'til I'm out
And it is what it is 'til it ain't, yeah

Close my eyes before I cross the street
If a car about to hit me, then he ought to beep 
Watchin' Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep
It's harder than it seems, I'm underwater in my dreams
I'm in awe, this jigsaw puzzle's not complete
I'm just an idea, nothin' con-cer-ete 
I came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines
They tryna change wit' us, but come to the same difference 
Shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
I don't mind those hatin' on my style
I tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low
I'm no God
I don't think that I'm a human though, 'cause I'm so odd
People sellin' drugs 'cause they can't find no job
Wonder if Christ made a million off of sellin' the cross
Let bygones be bygones, my mind strong as pythons
The day that I die on will turn me to an icon
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on
The best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan, Dylan

FlyLo's still tryna put me onto Ableton
Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me
I ain't nobody, and neither are you 
Been contemplatin' if I even still believe in the truth, I'm so stubborn
I'd rather write my own history book
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
All your songs are 16's and a hook
We here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution
I'm dyin' for the movement, tryin' not to lose it
Jewish Buddhist consumin' the views of Christianity
Wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in a igloo
I hear the fish bitin' nice right now
I can't figure out life and feel right right now
Boo, if I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it down

I think I know it all but I don't
Why you always at the mall when you're broke? Yeah
And I just wanna ball
Maybe dunk but I never been tall, yeah
I might trip, I never fall
God knows I came close 
I know I probably need to do better
Fuck whoever, keep my shit together
You never told me bein' rich was so lonely
Nobody know me; oh, well
Hard to complain from this five-star hotel
I'm always in a rush, I've been thinkin' too much, but
Keep it on the hush, no one need to know, just us
That's really all it takes
We don't need nothin' but today , today 
Today , today 
The world is so small 'til it ain't
I'm buildin' up a wall 'til it break
She hate it when I call and it's late
I don't wanna keep you waitin' 
I hope I never keep you waitin' 
Woo

Yeah, got a bad attitude, playin' 'til I'm out of moves
No need for shame, I get mo' peace at slow speeds
Go beat the game, young control freak
It's cold in my veins, I'm below freezin', snow season 
They know that I so need my space
Don't wanna grow old so I smoke just in case
She say that I glow below the waist
And the stroke is just so PGA
All I got is a little bit of space and time
Drawin' shapes and lines of a world we made
Tomorrow may be right around the corner
But I swear it's gon' be worth it if I make you wait
There's somewhere above you, keep reachin' up
That's really all it takes 
We don't need nothin' but today , today 
Today , today 
The world is so small 'til it ain't
I'm buildin' up a wall 'til it break
She hate it when I call and it's late
I don't wanna keep you waitin' 
I hope I never keep you waitin'
Yeah, nine times out of ten I get it wrong
That's why I wrote this song, tell myself to hold on
I can feel my fingers slippin'
In a motherfuckin' instant, I'll be gone
Do you want it all if it's all mediocre?
Starin' at the wall and the wall full of posters
Lookin' at my dreams, who I wanna be?
I guess you gotta see it to believe
Ooh, I been a fool but it's cool, that's what human beings do
Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes
Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
But the sun comin' out now, clouds start to move
Don't tell me nothin' but the truth
I'm tired, I don't got a spare second
Win or lose, win or lose
I don't keep count, nobody checkin'Yo, all your bitches got the green boat

All that horse shit, you shoulda left it at the barn
Keep a stallion, tell her gallop to the store and get cigars, yeah
Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made 
I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase
Me and my bizarre ways 
I moved up from a Private to a Sergeant, you can see it from the scarface
Hidden in a dark place, swimmin' in a shark tank
Give a bitch a little bit of change, she a game in a arcade
 Not a second to lose
I'm the motherfuckin' Bible, that's forever the truth 
And this is not another case of the celebrity blues
The devil wit' me and he tell me to shoot, boom
Murder, murder, murder, murder , what would you do?

Leave it to me, I do enough for us all 
Got what you need if you like breakin' the law
My mother raised me a God 
Yeah
Blame the drugs, got me sinnin' on a weekday
Drunk as fuck, do a buck sixty on the freeway 
Givin' y'all the freebase, hidden in the middle of a briefcase
That's hidden in a subwoofer, beat case
Used to wanna know how a freak taste
Now I'm in it in an instant like replay
Broad's a baton, pass her off like relay
Why I'm so mad on my B-Day?, she say
"I thought you got sober," then I said
"I wish you'd stop bein' a bitch and get to mindin' your business"
Told me, "Money has changed ya"
I get to thinkin', how rarely do I visit? How'd I get so egotistical?
I'm a Buffalo Soldier
Heaven is a mile away, the trouble, much closer
I'm only twenty-three but my mind is older, and it'll forever be
Dead presidents to the homies, death to my enemies
Murder, murder, murder, murder , what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for somethin' to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all
Got what you need if you like breakin' the law
My mother raised me a God 
A goddess told me "Good mornin'" when I woke up
You know I had a good mornin' when I woke up
Gotta thank God every mornin' then I woke up
Would you remember me if I never woke up?
Bye-bye 
I've been a sinner, I'm just tryna stay
Warm through the winter, and I'll be on my way
I'm just a drifter, in endless seas of whispers
I just need some shelter, give me shelter from the wind
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh 
Ooh—ooh—ooh
Woo—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh—woo—woo
Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system
412-9... *buttons dialed* is not available
"Yeah, man, I wish you were here, happy holidays
Um, I love ya. And I hope you have a good night/weekend/I hope I talk to you soon, alright, godspeed"
Oh yeah
I thought I'd have it figured out by now
Shit would be simple, problems would be in the past by now
Me and the homies would be sittin' on millions
Reminiscin' on times when we were so broke and livin' in Oakland just chillin'
I thought I'd have it in the bag by now
I thought that we'd be kickin' back by now
I know that life is a bitch
I know that life is a bitch, I thought we'd put her in a cab by now
But I'm stressin', I can't relax
Swallowin' my pride and I'm hidin' what's makin' me mad
Everybody sayin' I need rehab
'Cause I'm speedin' with a blindfold on
It won't be long until they watchin' me crash
And they don't wanna see that
They don't want me to OD and have to talk to my mother
Tell her they coulda done more to help me
And she'd just be cryin'
Sayin' that she'd do anything to have me back
All the nights I'm losin' sleep
It was all a dream, there was a time that I believed that
But white lines be numbin' them dark times
The pills that I'm poppin', I need to man up
Admit it's a problem, I need to wake up
Before one mornin' I don't wake up
You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya
I'm too obsessed with goin' down as a great one
But if you wait too long they gon' find someone to replace ya
So I guess this is a letter
To all my brothers: Most Dope, that's forever
I love you more than words could express
And this the part that Q start cryin', if he ain't already yet
I did my best to be a leader you respect
At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret
So tell my baby I love her
And if she give me the chance I'll put a seed inside her, make her a mother
Just know that there's a place
Where all my people worry free and e'rybody straight
Every devil don't got horns, every hero ain't got capes
Open up my eyes, shit, I'm finally awake, good mornin'
Yeah, good mornin'
Yo Vin, it's the morning, you gotta go to work
Alright
Yo, you gotta—you gotta be at work in like ten minutes, yo
I'm good, man
You good?
I'm straight, yo, what's good?
When you going?
You gotta go pick up the dry cleaning and shit still?
Man, fuck that shit, I'll skip
You 'bout to go to work?
Mmm
Aight, what time you gotta be at work?
I don't know... soon
You Democrat or Republican?
Uh... I don't know anymore
Would you vote for a female president?
Mmm, I don't care what gender or race you are*Coughs*
I think I'm getting sick
Been in this room
Like I was hiding from somethin'
Look, ugh
Posing a question: how many been empty and holdin' aggression?
Close to depression, open your eyes and just focus a second
Fuck a recession, my brother my mind is my weapon
I'm lettin' it go, loaded and pointed at negative energy
Tellin' me stop, they tellin' me, "No" 
Your aura is something you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, whores got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feeling come after the shock
Praise me, I'd rather you not, 'cause
It's drivin' me crazy, the fact that you pay me amaze me
That's somethin' I love
You come to the club searchin' for drugs, drunk, fuckin' these sluts
God loves me, what if he does? What does it mean?
You wastin' away doin' nothin', you frontin'
Why aren't you chasin' your dreams, ugh?
We wonder 'bout life, but none of us willing to learn
The money we earn is something to burn
Why won't they give me a turn? L
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?
When them high-rollers homes in Vegas raided with some home invasion
Contaminatin' the place with plague, we just saved the day
I waste away in a room spittin' these raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm givin' it back, yep
It's a gift
 Our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
 Our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
Forfeitin' the war, he lays his sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store, begins to contemplate
Dealin' with death like he work in the morgue, absorbing souls forgotten
He lost his way, starin' down that barrel, thinkin', "Not today"
Life's so precious, Lord knows that life is so precious
Fight to the death 'til there's nobody left
And you holdin' your breath 'cause you might get infected
I'm animalistic, instinctively thinkin' of getting ballistic
Be specific, to those in control we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined
My trigger finger itchin', all I kill is time—*Bang*
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shooting lasers
'Cept I'm cool with Vader and blowin' up rooms that's full of strangers
A news anchor the youth can relate to, it's nature
You a hater? I'll deal with you later, no, thank ya
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors
Really Doe, come on, homie, we major
I waste away in this room spittin' out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back
It's a gift
 Our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
 Our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's just a different time, man
It's just a different time
There was a time
When we showed love
Da, da-da, da-da, da-da
You know like how we 
Approach a young lady 
You see a beautiful young lady, you like 
You say, damn, man 
You're gorgeous 
I'll take off my coat right now and 
Lay it down on the puddle and 
Make sure you don't miss a step 
Da, da-da, da-da, da-da
You know what I'm talking 'bout, young man? 
See all these bitches and... 
Hoes and...

Hold on tight when demons come
It'll be alright, no need to run
Stay with me tonight, we'll see the sun
And when we wake up early we'll still be young
Never felt this free before, I need you more
Than keys need doors, I need you sleepin' next to me
The blanket sheets, I'll take them all and keep you warm 
And I teach her that we were the creatures of love
You be the leader, I could be Julius Caesar
When I'm pullin' up in the Bimmer
The beats in the trunk, all the freaks wanna fuck

Hello, I would like to tell you about my love affair with my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other, and find out about each other. We got to know each other little by little, living very close in the same building, and he would help me with things, and I would see him and think "what a cute guy," and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little, we got to know just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being... finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...
So, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other.Someone like, someone like

Light up 'til the pain gone , all I hear is the same song 
When the radio came on, fuck around and get based on 
Do this shit 'til the day I die , are you ready , are you ready? 
Terrified but my hand is steady , verified, get the camera ready 
Carry my own weight, all these earthquakes don't wake
Me up from this deep sleep , divin' into this cold lake 
Fuck a bitch 'til her toes shake , tellin' me I'm her soulmate 
Disguised emotion, no face, bullshit with that, no thanks 
Dealin' with it since '08 , fucked around, now I'm done
And I heard you're supposed to race when you hear the sound of that gun 
Now it's losin' all of its fun , spendin' days in solitude
Too many dumb interviews, put me in this awful mood
Not thinkin' logical , gettin' high, jump off the moon 
Looked into his soul, when he died right there in the hospital
Peace don't seem possible , when the mind is so closed 
Came in for your money , then left with all of your hoes, ha
Life move fast but my baby keep it slow
Open up your mind, start forgettin' what you know, oh
Shit ain't been the same since she left me here alone, whoa
You hurt so good, girl, your lovin' hurt so good
Uh
Love me, love me, that fentanyl, it numb me 
Beautiful, it get ugly, turn you into a junkie 
Still searchin' for something , but I don't know what 
Dreaming about nothing, wake you up and then fuck 
I love it when you get a little nasty 
Hit it from the back, if you like that, wiggle them ass cheeks 
Isn't that sweet? Same shit we did last week 
'Fore all the cash, you might've stood up and would've walked past me 
Wake me up from this bad dream , put a match to this gasoline 
Every night you somebody different, got me thinkin' it's Halloween
Fucked up, can't feel myself, work hard, might kill myself
Exist through audio, but all my problems as real as hell
Trapped in this wishin' well, death creepin' like Splinter Cell
Gettin' high, blew my mind away, find the words, what I'm tryna say
...I'ma think of that later 
When the world goes against you, you better get that paper 
Life move fast but my baby keep it slow
Open up your mind, start forgettin' what you know, oh
Shit ain't been the same since she left me here alone, whoa
You hurt so good, girl, your lovin' hurt so good

Was that good for you?
Was that good for you?
Was that good for you?Well, this is what it look like right before you fall
Stumblin' around, you've been guessing your direction
Next step, you can't see at all
And I don't have a name, I don't have a name, no
Who am I to blame? Who am I to blame though?
And I cannot be changed, I cannot be changed, no
Trust me, I've tried
I just end up right at the start of the line
Drawin' circles
Mmm
Well, I drink my whiskey, and you sip your wine
We're doing well, sittin', watchin' the world fallin' down, its decline
And I can keep you safe, I can keep you safe, mmm
Do not be afraid, do not be afraid
You're feeling sorry, I'm feeling fine
Don't you put any more stress on yourself, it's one day at a time
It's gettin' pretty late, gettin' pretty late
Damn, and I find
It goes around like the hands that keep countin' the time
Drawin' circlesIt was all about a dream
Turned into reality, double-cup of lean
Uh
Let me get a one-way ticket, haven't picked a destination
I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station
Packin' no bags, nothin' but the clothes on my back
With a Cognac, let me sip it, tryin' to relax
Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon
I got a army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan
Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on
I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't stayin' long
What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?
I told my story, put my life inside this ink pen
Said I'll make it big when everybody know me
Well, I made it big and everybody phony, ha
So could you pour me? I need a cup
No, none of that liquor, mix in purple stuff
I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much?
Go 'head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
What the—, what the fuck is time? 
Ask 'em, what the fuck is time? 
What the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?
What do you do when you think you could be a icon?
'Cause all these people get to screamin' when the lights on
Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, zebra coat
Racin' to the gate but my flight gone
And now these writers takin' shots without a Nikon
But I don't fight though, figure it's a typo
Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though
Potion in my Sprite, then my night slows... down, down 
See, that's exactly what I need
My khaki's filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat
Like it was "Donald Trump," a fuckin' hit but I just call it luck
They throw it on when I'm walkin' in the club
Hey, this the 'Burgh shit, I don't deserve this
Well, I don't think you lookin' far beyond the surface
Learn quick, now I'm big time
Fill ya cup up, and I'ma sip mine
Fill it up with dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
What the—, what the fuck is time? 
Ask 'em, what the fuck is time? 
What the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?
A'ightYeah
Well
I got a bone to pick like roses 
I ain't feelin' broken no more
Balled a fist, they gossipin', I notice
Talkin' shit, I wander through the motives
Wonder who the fuck we're supposed to be
I ain't worried now 'til I leave
I'm just tryna ride and feel the breeze
With somethin' bad beside n' next to me
Wind in my face, don't stop now when it feels so great
You can run 'til you slip on the sidewalk
And the same bone that you picked gon' break, that's a motif 
Yeah, when it's comin' right back, so familiar, never been realer
Never felt so damn good where I'm at
I don't know what it's all about
Runnin' through too many thoughts to count 
Still ain't addin' up, I'll let you know when I've had enough, yeah
Yeah, well
I'd put some money on forever, but I 
Don't like to gamble on the weather, so I
Just watch while
The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon
The walls keep gettin' wider, I just hope I never find 'em, I know
Hey, well
These are my wings, these are my wings, yeah
These are my wings, yeah, well
Movin' so fast, the clock look slow 
Water my seeds 'til the flower just grow, yeah
Love so much that my heart get broke
I don't really know how the normal shit go, so
I guess I just play it by ear, silence is all that I hear
Listenin' close as I can
Growin' up , jump
Nobody holdin' my hand, no
Trust is a problem, never knew how
Yeah, that's why I just keep to myself
Get what I need, then I'll be out 
Who can surf the universe with me?
Lucifer is human, so are we
All I ever want is what I need
And that don't include your time and company
Follow me, we on the up and up
Remember when I owed a hundred bucks?
Now, I look around like, "What the fuck?"
If you don't fuck with me, you fuckin' up
I know I need to watch my temper, so I
Don't ever gamble on the weather, but I
Just watch while the
The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon
The walls keep gettin' wider, I just hope I never find 'em, no, no
Yeah, well
These are my wings, these are my wings
These are my wingsWoah

Nike-Nike-Nikes, Nike-Nike-NikesUh, ign'ant-ass white kid 
But I'm still bicycling and recycling 
And I'm still eating gummy bear vitamins
All my bitches taking Vicodin, huffing nitrogen 
Hyper than Williams' middle son
Since I was a little one, moms had to put me on the Ritalin
Made a swisher run, crack the 40 then I lit a blunt
Told Chuck I had a couple raps, so we kicked the drums
All the best rappers are usually dead
But I'm the poison that left a widow Juliet
In the studio with candles lit and Buddha heads
Coming up with all the coldest shit, take your Sudafed
Contagious, speaking while sedated
God shit, make 'em want to add a couple pages to the Bible
I ain't got nothing left in my will
'Cept, "Throw it all in the casket, it's mine still"
Uh, I need some backpack cast raps
Took a break just to kill the game half-assed
Set some rat traps, went and took a cat nap
Woke up, threw the dead bodies in the trash bags
Act polite, but I'm nasty on the mic
Your bitch don't want my dick, then she has to be a dyke
Slap her but she like it, tell me, "Master, feed me pipe"
I'm the scotch on the rocks, you the Appletini type
Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it
Gees...
Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it
Gees, woah...

Bozo on these doppelgänger Jojos 
Take a bitch to Soho for some Froyo
Tell her she gon' blow it: Romo
And now I'm out in Cali like Tone-Lōc 
Young boy, but I'm chilling with some grown folk 
No joke, Most Dope, you just bowl smoke
How much coke you gotta sell to make a boat float?
Hit 'em, hit 'em 'til they tell me, "No more" 
I'm a highly difficult ropes course
Pulling up to Rome on a chrome gold horse
Say "Wassup?" to the Pope, pull off in a Porsche
Who you kidding? Your flow's warshed
I ain't in the street but I'll grill you from the porch 
I been had hoes, I played sports 
Her ass out the bottom of her shorts 
Suck my dick before I slap you with it
Gees...
Bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with it
Gees...
Uh  
Turned my daughter to a queen, turned a dollar to a dream
Flashy as high beams, smoking on good weed
Something from kush seeds, the only strand to smoke for us OGs
I'm rich car service, no car keys 
First class flight, 'bout to land to a new bitch 
She fuck me and swallowed every homie I came wit' 
MCM bag and nigga, bet some weed in it
200 dollars worth of Backwoods, we all living 
Brought the gangsters back to bucket hat, how real is that? 
I'm getting money, rub my tummy, that's my baller sack 
Quarter million in a safe in case I get a case
Faggot-ass judge hatin' on me 'cause my money straight 
Dropped 10 racks in all 50 states 
Gon' name my next tour Million-Man March 
Make a nun throw it back while I pull her scarf 
She gave me head, my nuts touched her cross, boss
Figg Side!

You was coughin' when you hit my weed
But I've never seen you feel that free
So cute, you wanna be like me
Wouldn't you rather get along?
Wouldn't you rather get along?
Until, until there is no longer
Let's get lost inside the cloud
And you, you don't gotta work harder
I can calm you down
Yeah, well, I was busy when you hit my phone
But you miss me, told me come back home, yeah
And you don't really like to sleep alone
But I'm takin' too long, I'm always takin' too long
Baby, we don't need a trip, we could be right here
When the shit get weird, we could switch up gears
I wanna see them lips, kissin' ear to ear
I wanna hear your song
Oh, I wanna feel just how you feel
Touch you one more time so I know you're real
We could spin that wheel, wouldn't you rather get along?
Until, until there is no longer
Let's get lost inside the cloud
And you, you don't gotta work harder
I can calm you down
I think we just might be alright, thank God
I think we're gonna be alright, alright, okay

Yeah, used to wanna be a superhero
Flyin' round with a cape catchin' bad guys
Now my head underwater
But I ain't in the shower and I ain't gettin' baptized 
To the good and the bad times 
All the cuts, broken bones, and the black eyes 
Young motherfucker with a mad mind
Made a couple million off of rap lines
Y'all can’t tell me nuttin' no more
Came from the basement under that floor 
You don't come close, you don't even know I'm the G.O.A.T
You don’t need to know how I go
'Cause I know what you want
All I wanna do is the most
Backflip off the rope, sky hook when I'm in the post
Yeah, my girl too clutch to choke 
And I ain't callin' it quits
You can build a wall with your bricks
While I keep talkin' that shit, it's like this  
Liquor still in my cup 
Get faded when I wake up 
'Cause everything is too much 
So what? 
Woke up this mornin' with a bright idea 
Maybe I can exist forever right here 
Yeah 
Hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm, hmm
Okay, okay
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
Hundred-twenty on a car that I don't whip 
I don't even pull it up the driveway
Throwin' up shots like I don't miss 
Never put a limit on the high stakes 
Try to pull my card, tell them, "Go Fish" 
You ain't gonna find a lie in my face
I pick it up and let it go quick
They wanna get pussy from my—
Yeah, I don't say nuttin' that I don't know
Jumpin' out the womb wearin' Polo
Everybody wanna jump in, but I'm old school
Lone wolf, take 'em on solo, yeah
I don't need nobody 
I don't need to be nobody 
I'm just doin' my thing
Kick it at the crib, I don't see nobody, no
So over there with that bullshit
We don't need it on this side 
I'm pullin' up in that new shit
You always whippin' that dick ride 
I demand your respect
I won't share my connect 
Let's get this clear, I am here
I don't care who got next, young vet 
Feelin' like they forget, I let it slide, this time
Like twenty-five years I've been high and no less 
Shit, I know, I don't guess
Rather glow, I won't stress
Better say that shit with your chest
Okay, okay
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel 
Well, I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, gettin' lost 'til I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel 
Fate in your hands
While you're waitin' for me
I'm already there
Fallin' in deep

We be high, lookin' for another fuckin' tree to climb
She was playin' hard to get, I read between the lines
Binge watched Sopranos, made it all the way to season five

My name Mac Miller, who the fuck are you?
Well, my crew too live, but I ain't Uncle Luke
And I ain't no hipster, but girl, I can make your hips stir
From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher
Welcome  to the Cam Rellim chronicles
Lookin' out my monocle
I'm dodgin' obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cock-a-roach, I'm heroin 'cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and fuckin' shiny, word to Mop & Glo
Tryin' to get a mansion, ain’t nobody here gon' find my room
Money gon' be green, I guarantee you that my slide stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template
The next day, these losers always goin' with what's trendy
My pen game is somethin' these motherfuckers have never seen
All City Champion, everybody is second-string
No need to testify  for the best is I 
And anybody in my way gon' be left to die
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back 
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve, bitch
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back 
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
I got my own stickers now, so literally I’m everywhere
Hundred different shoes, still feel the need to cop a fresher pair
These motherfuckers treat me like it’s just my second year
Fool, you better get prepared
Don't know 'bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
Frick Park Market, where we kickin' out the garbage
Sick bars, I’ve been a boss, so stick around and watch it
Didn't fit around no college campus, chillin', writin' on top of planet Earth
Fuck who's first, It’s just 'bout who the hardest
On my own, too, fuck who's sayin' different
Every time I rhyme, I get that Punxsutawney feelin'
I’m the starter, you a fill-in
You a martyr, I’m just killin'
Gettin' harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin' it and goin' in
Don’t call me Malcolm if you didn't fuckin' know me then
And if you lonely, girl, I could be your only friend
You got some shit to say? I suggest you hold it in, bitch
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back 
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
If you don't hold me down, for all I care, you can starve, bitch
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back 
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
Yeah

Snowflakes keep fallin' on my expired debit cards
Don't know why I'm still awake, I gotta be up at 10 tomorrow
Missiles in my repertoire, I'd say I'm pretty regular
I never leave my house, I don't know why I got an extra car 
My pool-house studio is covered up with pencil marks
And everyday it's full of jokers like a deck of cards 
Swear, I'm so lonely, there's horns on my dome-piece 
But I'm not the devil, I'm a motherfuckin' minotaur
Oh my God, look at how upset you are
'Cause we out here winnin', brought my dogs from out the reservoir 
And I'ma let 'em bark, before you ready my set will start
We forgot our roots before and, trust me, things, they fell apart
Wash myself with acid, it's because I got a denim heart
My conscious so weak I need to split it up in seven parts 
Revis brought me out to Cali for the first time
Went to Amar'e's party, took tequila shots with Kevin Hart
 But Kevin don't remember that
I saw him at the VMAs, told a joke - he never laughed 
The rap diablo, free your mind my motto
And we all gon' be good if TreeJay ever hit the lotto 
So arigato, so shit, you know I'm world famous
And R. Kelly been told me I'm the world's greatest 
But still to fall in love is like an orgasm
'Cause you never gonna know if your girl fake it
I'm always faded, gettin' shaded in the basement
I just bought a cello, now all I do is play it 
Thank God that I made it  ask Q where Dave is 
He'll probably tell you that he rollin' midnights out in Vegas 
Me? I'm in my spaceship, my face is so complacent
Wear a suit to cash a check, we goin' to the banquet 
And Jimmy got the burner, but he don't wanna murder
And ClockWork is somewhere out in Sweden speaking Danish like
 Hi Sven, isn't this your language?
That man must be a alien, I really can't explain it, shit
It's just a little cocaine sniff *Snorts*
But the lines longer than parades is  yeah
I think it's time to give me all your praises 
So I can get this money and give all the homies raises 
My life is on these words, this is my affidavit 
And if you want a legal battle, send your ass to David 
Um, I'm half-man, half-amazin'
Probably half-God, but that don't fit my calculations
 I know the planet Earth is 'bout to explode
Kinda hope that no one save it, we only grow from anguish
Yeah

There's snowflakes fallin' on my debit card
Swear I'm not alive, I couldn't tell you if we ever are
In this Game of Thrones, it is known I got the 4G
LTE connection bars, no control, fuck Ken' Lamar
 I don't vote, I never registered 
But I'm a magnet for them zeros, call me Edward Sharpe 
I wake up feelin' dead, I need a fresher start
So me and Q put people on the label we don't remember 
Smiled as I saw Jerm nerdin' out with Josh Berg
Talkin' analog gear and drinkin' Arnold Palmer 
In the other room, watchin' C-Span with E. Dan
Layin' down a baseline, doin' drums with his free hand 
When I was in first grade, I wished to be Puerto Rican
My mom took me to a barbershop to get some cornrows
I walked in, ready for them Sprewell braids
But the lady said my hair was too short though  man
I always thought my moms was the illest for that shit 
Drivin' through the hood, she did not have a reaction 
With a six-year-old she kept the doors unlocked
And drove by the 5-0 like “fuck those cops!”
Goddamn, it just don't stop 
I know my father pro'bly wish I would just smoke pot *Inhales*
My grandma pro'bly slap me for the drugs I got 
I'm a crackhead but I bought her diamonds, we love rocks

And still all these bitches will get in position 'cause I got their pussies all drippin' in paint 
Somehow, I'm makin' this music it's just to relate to
 And I got the life raft, ain't gonna save you
Look at my reflection  I broke the mirror
It's only for protection  shit keep gettin' weirder 
And I can't see a thing but  things never been clearer 
Call the Mothman, it's Richard Gere 
Yeah, this is our year
Let's get fucked up and get the fuck up outta here 
I've kicked it with the aliens, a different stratosphere 
And lookin' down like, "We come in peace" 
Yeah, I told Will and Bill they need to kick the habit 
We on the same trip, we just got different baggage 
Parks spilled the grape juice on all of Dylan's dad's shit 
We were just some motherfuckin' kids

The Divine Feminine, an album by Mac Miller
Ohhhhh-ohhh
Ohhhhh 
Am I supposed to? Okay... love
Love, love, love, love, love 
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love 
This sun don't shine when I'm alone
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised, this all I know
I felt the highs and they feel like you
See a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl, I'm so in love with you, yeah
Girl, I'm so in love with you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah , yeah, yeah
Um, well
Baby, you were everything I ever wanted
Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college?
Hours on the phone, we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
Mr. Charmin', that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said, "All you ever think about is sex"
I'm like, "Oh well, you know me so well
And if this what make you late, I swear, I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail"
Well, I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass is what Heaven's like
And when I'm in that pussy, it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
It's my only chance, I better get it right
Take your time, my baby
It's all waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
But it's all waitin' right here for you, for you
You get closer with, run away
All I ever known is the color gray
Your lovely ways bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine
Heaven probably not the same without you
But now you're in my world, in my world
Ahhhh, ahhhh
Ahhhh, ahhhhYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, things like this ain't built to last
I might just fade like those before me
When will you forget my past?
Got questions, ask, you know the stories
And you need to let me know
When you're leaving, where you go
Can I come?
Do you believe me, are you close?
Yeah, even if you don't
That'll get you sprung
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?
Yeah, don't run away, love
Hate love, heartbreak will have you bankrupt
Too many days in a daze, better wake up
I put your face in a place where the space was
Nobody makes you feel like you but 
And you don't know what you should do
You just lookin' for someone to make you move, ooh, tell me 
I make this planet feel like home
It's us versus time, the door is closing
So far beyond all our control
You saved a soul so close to broken
It's so much better when you wait
Forever and a day, that's all I got
Put it together then it break
All the energy it take, it never stop
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?
Yeah, I never slip, I never fall
I tried to tell you 'bout a better life
And get involved big or small
It's been my fault, I keep it safe, it's in the vault
Blindfolded, keep it going 'til we hit a wall, yeah
I'm never going through the motions
I'm just tryna lay your body down slowly
We can only go up
We can only go up
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?It's a blue world without you
It's a blue world alone
Yeah, well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mmm, don't trip, we don't gotta let him in
Don't trip
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I let it go
But I never go with it, mhm, yeah
Okay, cool as fall weather, fuck your bullshit
I'm here to make it all better with a little music for you
I don't do enough for you
Without you, it's the color blue, ooh, don't trip
I was in the city, they was talkin' that shit
Had the homies with me, all a sudden, they split
We ain't even worried, we just laughin', that's rich
You know how it goes, it ain't broke, don't fix
Hey, one of these days
We'll all get by
Don't be afraid
Don't fall
Think I lost my mind
Reality's so hard to find
When the devil tryna call your line, but shit, I always shine
Even when the light dim
No, I ain't God, but I'm feelin' just like Him, ooh, don't trip
See, I was in the whip, ridin', me and my bitch
We was listenin' to us, no one else, that's it
That's a flex, just a bit, let me talk my shit
Say my head got big, yeah
Yeah
Well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mmm, don't trip, we don't gotta let him in
Don't trip
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I let it go
But I never go with it, mhm
Don't trip
Don't trip
Don't trip
Well, if you could see me now
Love me and hold me down
My mind, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes
Yeah
Well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mmm, don't trip, we don't gotta let him in
Don't trip
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I let it go
But I never go with it, uh
Hey, one of these days
We'll all get by
Don't be afraid
Don't fall in lineNo
Yeah
No
Ugh, passport, filling it up with stamps
Set a camp up on my land, swam the rivers of Japan 
She keep on asking for a rack, so I ran
Looking back, like, you can't see who I am
Think my bitch don't know me no more 
'Cause everytime she's sad, I can't console her no more 
If money buy you love , then love's not enough 
So tell me why you on your knees crying to the floor
If you had the chance
Would you take the time you need to make it right?
The clouds are gray
But would you pay the price to paint 'em white?
Might have a baby on the way
Cause I been going in raw, it feel better, that real pleasure
I'm not real, I think I never was 
I get a rush every time she let me get a touch 
I need to feel that , I need to feel that 
My garden hasn't been growing so can you bring that ?
I keep my head up , a little fed up 
They always tell me where my mind is on this LP
I don't , hiero-
Pyro-, meta-
Telekinetics put 50K on my credit card 
Look for the answers, I'm searching but I ain't getting far 
Let's get it on, I'm royal like Tenenbaums in Lebanon
Decepticon, hit it 'til my head is gone
Point me to the road , and I'mma run it
Bloodhound with my nose  to the money
Ain't fucking with these hoes , getting ducats
'Til I die, while my foes  busy running, fuck it
Marijuana smoke in my stomach, ugh, toasted in public 
Head in the clouds, when my toes in the struggle
Like, who dare to test it? Test this
There's a few new rules in effect, bitch 
Listen up, go 
See, this a rather spooky action movie, roll it up and pass it to me
Hash and booty, absolutely, smack a groupie acting boujee
 ass beauty,  rather shoot me
Truly, bitches must have them bad jeans and back is Coogi
Had to do these rapper tunes to let 'em know the trap is booming
Past the views of Catholic schoolers, fact
But you, in fact, assuming
Back to doing , posted up like 
Rapper feuds are sad if you would battle for a stack or two
These ... eloquent irrelevant sentences show my penmanship
Indefinite boundaries show you the end of it
Don't forget, you infested in nesting crevices
Allowing birds to fall to their death before they even fly 
He and I are not the same
Doctor, doctor, please prescribe me something for the pain
Money in machines 
Those will make you change 
If I go tomorrow, I just hope it ain't in vain, but I can't complain
Point me to the road , and I'mma run it
Bloodhound with my nose  to the money
Ain't fucking with these hoes , getting ducats
'Til I die, while my foes  busy running, fuck it
Marijuana smoke in my stomach, ugh, toasted in public 
Head in the clouds, when my toes in the struggle
Like, who dare to test it? Test this
There's a few new rules in effect, bitch 
Listen up, goYah
Yo, yo
Look
Concoction of hamentashens 
Launchin' a bottle rocket 
Done bein' nice, I'm here for your life and all the profits 
I'm not your conscience, you nuts? Almonds and Häagen-Dazs
Auction off your grandfather's watch from the Holocaust 
I'm iconic, naked, walk in the garden bird watchin'
Alarmin' all of these cardinals like I need a pope 
Puffin' that white smoke  get faded and play the maestro
I'm ice cold, bunny slippers, nice robe 
Sneaky bitch stole my Rollie last night, yo 
I might know some dyke hoes who can fight though 
Walkin' on a tight rope, underneath a microscope
But close-up we all just molecules and isotopes 
My psychic don't know the future
To live life, you kids might just close your computer 
The street lights might blind you though 
Make a collage and look at it through a kaleidoscope
There's a bird in the sky
Look at him fly, why?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Ugh
Let the money pile, I'll be runnin' wild
Life's a motherfuckin' joke so we fuck around
Feel like I do this in my sleep 
Literally, I do this in my sleep
It's an impression of Bueller
Yeah, yeah
A little TV money , dollars for sense of humor 
Scholar but my attendance like Bueller, so no use for a tutor
Some cold brews in the cooler  comin' through
In the wood-grain PT Cruiser, stuntin' 
I'm pissed off like a blind person lookin' for a restroom 
Prob'ly be dead soon, inhalin' cigarette fumes *Coughs*
Sorry for that blind people comment, that was just rude 
And I was raised better, say, "God bless you"  haha
I'm Kenny Powers, you more of a Debbie Downer
My bitch takin' off her trousers every time I get around her
I'm nasty, I never shower, go sleep on a bed of flowers
Not into this conversation, I've been in my head for hours, I'm out
There's a bird in the sky
Look at him fly, why?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Ugh
Let the money pile, I'll be runnin' wild
Life's a motherfuckin' joke so we fuck around
Feel like I do this in my sleep 
Literally, I do this in my sleep"I know what happens to you, me and everyone else
When they supposedly die
It's this passage around the great loop"
Yeah, yeah, can you turn up my headphones?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This music go with my funeral, yeah, yeah
Music go with my funeral, a-hem, yeah, I said
Said I was raised inside this gritty city, ridin' through, you probably miss me
My bicycle fell, I hit the road, the mailman almost hit me
All these sins be more than shitty, I just pray the lord forgive me
Doin' drugs is just a war with boredom but they sure to get me
My side-bitch is sort of pretty, but she got enormous titties
Know I'm worth a fortune, she just want a brand new Porsche or Bentley
Had a few abortions, unfortunately, I forced them
Lord knows I turn a child to an orphan when I'm tourin'
I'm more than what I think of myself, I really have to be
Sit at home and drink by myself, my thoughts harassin' me
Actually, as a matter of fact, she ain't gettin' back to me
A shame that my tragedy my masterpiece, yeah
Trapped inside these dreams of mine
Just tryna get some peace of mind, yeah
I've been trapped inside these dreams of mine
So you'll never get a piece of mind
This the last  day 
Of my life 
Party like it's the last  day 
Of your life 
This the motherfucking last  day 
Of my life 
Party like it's the last  day 
Of your life 
Yeah, yeah
See we swallowed in this web of lies, never tried to exercise
You used to be a fantasy but now I guess it's televised
I heard the legends never died, oh this lonely hell of mine
There never was a better time to better myself
Forever I melt and float away like waves in the ocean
Starin' inside of Heaven's eyes, the gates will never open
I'm smokin' on this field of hope, waitin' 'til my deal gets closed
I keep gettin' hotter but all I seem to feel is cold
22 don't feel so old, but I think I'm 82
You mean to tell me God took seven days and all he made was you?
I'm out here with the kangaroos, makin' danger, break the rules
Celebrate my date of birth with acid, get the days confused
Happiness I take from you, searchin' for the naked truth
I'm not awake, I'm in a lake, I'll swim away with you
Bitch, check out the butterfly
If you the truth then what the fuck am I?
Yeah
This the last  day 
Of my life 
Party like it's the last  day 
Of your life 
This the motherfucking last  day 
Of my life 
Party like it's the last  day 
Of your life 
So where are you going?
Where are you headed?
Where are you going?
Can I come? Can I come?*Alarm clock sounds*
Um, uh
Woo, yeah
Woo, yeah
Okay, okay, yeah, um
We in-between heaven and hell 
Fuck a nine-to-five, I'd rather end up dead or in jail 
American Ninja to these obstacles, no stoppin' me, we on the move
Your mouth runnin' like a prostitute's, keep your head to yourself
I work harder than anybody you know 
I'm done with tricks, don't need no money to blow
Deadly aim, self-contained, superstar, they yell the name
Blood diamonds, finna go to hell for my chain
The P fitted on my head though
I'm too high, you can't reach me with the cell phone
No goodbyes, no hellos
You don't want this life I live, you'd rather had a wife and kid
Shootin' dice with Jesus Christ, put twenty on the midnight
To everyone who sell me drugs:
Don't mix it with that bullshit, I'm hopin' not to join the 27 Club
Just want the coke-dealer house with the velvet rug
Fuck the world, there's no one else but us 
Everything we think we love
It ain't nothin' but a brand name
To everyone but us 
It ain't nothin' but a brand name, nothin' but a brand name
Yeah
Ask her what she wearin', say it's nothin' but a brand name
Baby, this right here is handmade
Yeah
I got brothers, I don't need no friends 
My shoes off, I'm comfortable, I'm chillin', smokin' weed again 
I'm from the 'Burgh, not the burbs
Investigatin' my nation, homie, we ain't concerned
Went from the 412 out to the 310
Went from the pavement in my basement to them yellow brick roads
See, I was on my P's and Q's like L-M-N-O
But kickin' bitches out my crib, somebody tell 'em go home, oh, no
I was in the crib with my different shit
Simple livin', I'm a hypocrite 'cause I'm filthy rich and got businesses
Been had wifey, had mistresses
Been tryna tell you what my vision is, but y'all still ain't listenin'
The war ain't winnin', it's just beginnin'
And I've been 'bout Sparta like Michigan, I got stats
They got opinions, I got facts
LeBron left home, but he came back
This what raised me, made me rap
PA's baby, I ain't been to PA lately
See, I left and they call me shady
I'm a white rapper, they always call me Shady
Got no idea what I'm contemplatin', I guess 
Everything we think we love
It ain't nothin' but a brand name
To everyone but us 
It ain't nothin' but a brand name, nothin' but a brand name
Yeah
Ask her what she wearin', say it's nothin' but a brand name
Baby, this right here is handmade
Woo
La, la, la, la 
Yeah 
Everything we love, love
Good mornin' 
Good mornin'
And everyone but us 
Good mornin' 
Good mornin'
Yeah"Okay, you work a God damn lousy job, you know. You come home at night, you're tired. What are you going to do? Go to a movie? Turn on your radio? Hell no. You're going to get a bottle of whiskey and drink it, and go down to a bar and maybe get in a fist fight and meet some bitch. Something's going on. Then you'll go to work the next day, and do your simple little things, right?"
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My bitch can tell that I'm addicted to pussy, she looking past it
The smile that she faking is tragic, hate looking at it
That magic I try to grasp it, she's had it with the dramatics
Fantasize of love, so classic, attracted
To what she got up in her attic, can we mind fuck?
Do I lie when I look inside her eyes? Hush, don't say a word
I know I make you hurt, sorry is my favorite word
I don't deserve your trust, but can we make it work?
I hate to end the story, can we wait until the morning to decide on it?
Spend this time pretending it was that first summer
We was pure lovers
She was used to being hurt, I took that curse from her
Sometimes I wonder what it's all for, you wish that I would call more
You're sick of seeing condoms in my sock drawer
Love turns to war so quickly, I envisioned us married and 50
Couple of kids that we drop off at little league
I'm addicted to you, you only want the best, I need to listen to you
I'm fucking other girls, wishing it's you 
Fuck the bullshit, we in love
I'm a mess, but can you clean me up?
Girl, I'm the worst, yeah, I know that I'm the worst
Yeah
But you're something I can't lose, let me just tell you the truth
That'd be a first, yeah
Girl, I'm the worst, yeah, I know that I'm the worst
Don't know what I gotta do, just love you so much
That it hurts
Yeah, um
And I see you falling victim to the thirst, all the sins you committed
You could probably use a couple minutes in church
But, for what it's worth, I think you're perfect
There's an angel hiding underneath your surface
Yeah, the woman of my dreams, I'm looking at her sleep
The pussy right in front of me, I shouldn't be so weak
What did I do to deserve a love like this?
You see her shining? That's my sunlight, bitch
I'm sick of fighting, that smile is so inviting
I see you every time I'm writing
I'm losing to all my vices
They kicking my ass
I hold on to this feeling, I wish it would last
Don't wanna lose you for some evil I did in the past
You knew I fucked that bitch and you didn't react?
Girl, it's me and you, how simple is that?
Gave me all your love, now I'm giving it back
But I know that
Girl, you the worst, yeah
You know that you the worst
But I'm something you can't lose, if you just told me the truth
That'd be a first, but
Girl, you the worst, yeah
You know that you the worst
Every time you say you sorry everything you do
Just feel like it's rehearsed
"A road man."
"A what?"
"A road man."
"A road man."
"For the Lords of Karma."
"Yeah."
"For the Great Hall."Damn you rabbit, you smell like fuckin' piss!
Yeah, no fucks when I go nuts
You can kiss my ass
Give no fucks when I go nuts
'Cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa, yeah
Fuckin' rabbit!
I give no fucks when I go nuts
'Cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa, dead
Woke up from a coma
Poured up with a soda, smoked, went back to bed
Never thought I'd be such a loner
I tell my bitch that I fuckin' own her
My neighbor's daughter just got a dog
I'ma run it over, I'm a fuckin' soldier
So cold, bruh, fuck pneumonia
All my bitches got love for Sosa
I just wanna fuck Rosa Acosta
Then disappear in Southern California
Strung out 'til the night, I'm chillin'
Everybody worried that the lights might kill 'em
Uh, feel ya sight slippin'
Long lines of those white women
I'm with the homies, bump Counting Crows
Just went through a half ounce of coke
Blood pourin' all out my nose
Don't tell my mom I got a drug problem
I'm fuckin' high-ly publicized
When the sun go down, I come alive
'Cause the guns go off in the summertime
The guns go off in the summertime, blaow
This another motherfuckin' rap song
Broke and crazy, rich and famous doesn't last long
Spent all my cash on a broken dream
Went from weed and liquor to the coke and lean
All-all-all I got's this mansion and this potpourri
But don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Don't-don't-don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Whoa
The rabbit can kiss my ass
Come on, let's go man
I hate you
Fuckin' rabbit! Kill his ass!
I don't like rabbits comin' to my fuckin' house, I kill 'em
I blow a spliff before the ink dries on the paper
And lately, I don't like shit, I been inside on the daily
Gettin' wasted as the time that I'm spendin' high and sedated
I'm puttin' five in his face, because we don't buy into bullshit
As soon as it's flashin' lights then it's kush to hide in the bushes
I do this shit out of spite 'cause there's niggas that overlooked me forever
I'm more content with dark and stormier weather
Flip the fuckin' cross on your rosary, we supposed to be better
But here's a toast to your efforts
And don't approach me with nothin' that isn't money or breakfast
I'm close to chokin' a pussy, pussy
Sweaty Man, you best had bet your bottom dollar on him
With a couple niggas, weighin' sess like it's a lot of options
Fifteen on me for soda and swishers
And who's the shit, a bag of chips and a colon decleanser?
I'm over bitches tryna act like I owe 'em a picture
Rather introduce these hoes to Vince, who could show you a pistol
Listen, ST was the older initials
Been rap game tighter than boa constrictors
Rollin' stone like a boulder ravin'
I'm so impatient and goin' dumb as
Disclosin' my fuckin' home location to total strangers
No love in my heart for coppers, blood from my lungs on the sink
Cashin' out off the garments, the artist, fuck what you think
The sky'll turn black and the carrions could pick
At my flesh when I rest, tell 'em bury me adrift
This another motherfuckin' rap song
Broke and crazy, rich and famous doesn't last long
Spent all my cash on a broken dream
Went from weed and liquor to the coke and lean
All-all-all I got's this mansion and this potpourri
But don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Don't-don't-don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?

Fuckin' rabbit! I'm sick and tired of it, this shitty-ass rabbit stinks! Smells like pussy! He smells like an asshole! Smells like wet-back dick!
He smells like a bunch of bullshit!
Is it dead?
I dunno but I'm finna make sure
*Continuous gun firing*Yo, I'm fucking zooted right now in the fucking bathroom, dog. And, you know what I'm saying, I'm just recording this shit 'cause I feel like I got so much fucking shit to say and like, you know what I'm saying, this is the only way that I'ma get it out
Yeah, can I get the littlest bit of reverb on my voice? 
I'm tryin' to hide from somethin', I just don't know what
Oh, it's not sad, baby , you know?
Yeah, I, I, um, I saw a mountain, you know, across the horizon
And I got there, realized it was just a pile of rocks
Yeah, said, "Goddamn"
I wonder, yeah
And everybody hope that this song , is not  Depressin' as the last one was 
'Cause heaven smell like Nag Champas
So, come here darlin', ash my blunt 
Waitin' on hallucination, ain't a single fact I trust 
Dear family, my sanity go down when my cash go up 
Rap too much, how the fuck I get through the verse? 
I came from house parties
Find a bitch and go through her purse 
All I need is a little good pussy and a whole lotta universe 
I met God before I ever stepped into a church
And that motherfucker still owe me money 
Oh, I need a religion to follow 
I swear to God that I got more problems
Than there is bitches in Carlow 
Lord have Murciélago , yeah

And don't ever trust these bitches
What happened to your life when your house become a home?

By the kid havin' asthma attacks
'Cause he panicked every single time he sat on his glasses
Every Wonderland have a Alice

What you gonna do when everybody just go die out?
Let's ride out*Dog barking*
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, um

 Well
You could have the world in the palm of your hands
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
I tell 'em, "Red light, stop it"
Shit, that give me more headaches than alcoholics
There was nothin' in my wallet, just a lot of dreamin'
I built a crib on top o' the Promised Land, we'll call it even
Hmm, I bring more flavor than all the seasons
Winter, spring, summer, fall
The grass is always greener 'til I cut it all
Please leave me to my studies, I give you no applause
My hands been countin' money, and it's hard to be the boss
But somebody gotta do it 
Often with the bullshit, and, baby, I been through it
Enough for the both of us
So come over later and we won't let no one close to us
We could be posted up
Yeah
Okay, well, you could have the world in the palm of your hands

Clementine, peelin' off and everyone get left behind
I'm only 5'7'' 'cept I'm feelin' like I'm 7'5"
Damn it, cross planets, interstellar
Never land, not a Jackson, packed with action
So what's happenin', my man?
No relaxin', kickin' back, this ain't exactly in the plan

Macadelic
America
I'm, in a room filled with holographic images
Path is limitless, death, well, that's ridiculous
I'ma live forever, 'cause a legend never die
See the world as simple, but complex in the design
I spent some time just thinkin'
Where did that get me? High, more drinkin'
Now my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source
Bear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list
Try to understand the fuckin' message I encrypted
Ancient, halucinatin' visions of utopia
Until I figure out that the perfect world a lonely one
Never hold my tongue, vocal as a loaded gun
And I'ma shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run
Mac Miller, I'm the only one
But I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium
Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split 
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public 
Welcome to America 
Motherfucker, welcome to America 
My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split 
Hands on my nuts while I'm wilin' out in public 
Welcome to America 
Motherfucker, welcome to America 
Still, in a room filled with holographic images
Crushin' information into powder, then I'm sniffin' it
Directly to my head, never sleep or use my bed
Iller than the future death of you ingestin' Sudafed
Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest
Hop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress 
See, this is what I do the best
Nothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest
Save hard, a Braveheart, a warrior
I take part to stay far from coroners
I heard some corny words said about my music though
Talkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho
Most Dope, got you hooked, yellin', "Rufio"
First you lose your mind, then you lose your soul
So what you talkin' about? Thinkin' you out of options
American born, impeccable form
Above and beyond, never the norm
Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split 
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public 
Welcome to America 
Motherfucker, welcome to America 
My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split 
Hands on my nuts while I'm wilin' out in public 
Welcome to America 
Motherfucker, welcome to America 
Yo chick live in Pittsburgh? Bet I steal her
Shout out my wigga Mac Miller, comin' up in a world full of killers
I'll be shaded up at the villa
With a girl that know what the deal is
Yeah, they know I come from the illest
City on the map, we don't know how to act, ah!
Realest young rap go-getters in America
Bad chicks get tossed around like the merry-go
CV and Mac Meezy takin' off on PJ's
We the future, so every night is a new day
Sittin' in the studio, chain on and my hat low
Young visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show
I can trigger the wave in my sleep
Name paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat, ah!
Wake up shower, get paid and repeat
Spit one flow and got made on the streets
Welcome to the land where you never stay for free
Swag worth a mill, drop cast let it deal
Veggies
Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split 
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public 
Welcome to America 
Motherfucker, welcome to America 
My middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split 
Hands on my nuts while I'm wilin' out in public 
Welcome to America 
Motherfucker, welcome to America 
'Bout to drop hot shit, runnin' out of patience, niggas not sick
Rollin' up the dankest loud, plane goin' Mach 6
Rise to the top and topics change
To Glocks and the Stock Exchange
Now watch the price of life on the block drop, insane
You can't stop this reign, don't name-drop in vain
Inhale toxic flames from tropic strains, it's awkward, strange
Last week he was nothin', boxers stain
Now everybody love him and chicks offer top for fame
To the top I aim, testin' waters, so I've been afloat
No deal but flow so real, he been in the scopes
Sun got shine, now they say he shady, but he never dippin' though
Still facin' L's, you would think a nigga wins was low
What you think I'm in this for?
Won't stop 'til the nigga who invented dope
End the flow or behind bars, droppin' prison soap
Beggin' for forgiveness, but it's business though
I'm record spittin' Guinness flows
Got it up in sources, now he in the storeSometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Uh
Yeah 
Man, my voice probably sounds mad raspy right now
 Yeah
So step up on the mic and, uh
Show 'em what you got, tiger
A'ight, look
Uh, sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
So I've been lookin' in the mirror and it still don't make no sense
I'm askin', "What am I supposed to do?"
Done so much in my short lifetime, but I haven't done shit
I done flew around the whole world
First I shook a million hands, then I took a million pictures
But I'm a hostage in my own world
Yeah, my thoughts my own enemy, got no time for these bitches
I got too much on my damn mind
So if I add some more stress, I just don't see how I'ma cope
I think they underestimate the grind
I do to bring this dough, and I'm only 20 years old
I wonder why I sip this devil juice, 'cause it feel incredible
Problems, I got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Uh, I've been blessed with, much to be expected
What am I doing here?
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here? 
What am I doing here?
I hope this feelin' last for fuckin' ever
I don't wanna come back down, let me stay above the ground
I hope I do what I was meant to do
'Cause I've been searchin' for that answer, I just hope I get it now
Please, let me find euphoria
When you up above the clouds, like, "Who gon' touch me now?"
And do we ever get to know the truth?
'Cause everybody seems to have it, but to me it seems they lack it
Now I'm rollin' and I'm sippin' lean
Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love
Drinkin' liquor and I'm smokin' weed
And you don't ever do too much if you could never do enough
Wonder why it's me instead of you, I'll be there to rescue you
Problems, you got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Uh, I've been blessed with, much to be expected
What am I doing here?
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?
Uh, sittin' in my Bentley,  thinkin' 'bout these hoes
All I do is kill 'em, I kill 'em like Nicole
Simpson, flag crimson, smoke 'em like Winstons
I just bought a new chopper, I treat it like an infant
I'm lightin' up a stogie, it's longer than a hoagie
Situation's gettin' fishy and I don't eat anchovies
Fuck the world, kill 'em all, she answer when I call
If the cops pull us over, she gon' hide it in her drawers
See, I come from a place where stars never shine
And drama is accepted, credit cards are declined
Everybody gotta die, but I ain't everybody
If that ho play with me, I whoop that chick like Terrence Howard
I'm a pimp, I ain't lyin', but that is not important
I'm just tryna buy time, but can't really afford it
Sayin' ain't that a bitch, but I hope that bitch is bad
I feel like money in the trash, like...
What am I doing here? 
I wonder what am I doing here 
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?Think for yourself and you'll find out
That a lot of those so-called authorities are bullshit
Yeah, ay, Jerm, Jerm
Yeah, ahhh! Ahhh!
Ah, I'm the muh'fuckin' greatest, y'all don't know that yet
I don't need your money, you can hold that check
At the crib in some Polo sweats
I don't need a ho, that's what the hoes don't get, whoa 
I'm on my worst behavior 
Bad side piece with the pertinent flavor 
Muh'fuckers never loved us
Comin' for your money, muh'fucker don't trust us 
Uh, you ain't shit
Bought a brand new crib, yeah, I move that brick 
I don't want nothin' with your doo-doo clique 
Treat her like a dog how I do that bitch, uh
Done doin' promo 
And it's still motherfuckin' Most Dope 
Made a couple million off a brand
Muh'fucker, we ain't even got a logo, uh
Bitch, you better have my money 
I don't see anybody but me 
Keepin' shit too real 
See a muh'fucker like me gettin' money 
Already been but I'm back for more
Insomniac, I don't know what I got a mattress for
Insomniac, I don't know what I got a mattress for
Don't sleep!
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac 
Yeah, yeah, said, said
I'm a maniac, crazy, act insane
Think I might need a cage in fact
Chain reactions happen when I make a pact
A psycho, God made me that
'Cause I fade to black, I gets down like a plane attack
You muh'fuckers just made me laugh
Ha ha, God damnit, this ain’t a drill, do not panic
Let me see how loud you scream 
I'm off the map, muh'fuckas start lookin'
But they're never gonna see where I be
She only speak French
Said "Bitch look, don't try and speak around me"
And I don't sleep at all
If you on that bullshit, I ain't gonna be involved
Shit, shit, shit
I could make a million puttin' my lyrics on a tee 
Fearless, Jet Li, fourth quarter, Gretzky
Take your bitch, Joe Pesci, don't test me
Don't flex if you ain't got shit on me
And, you ain't got shit on me, come get it
Jar full of fresh white snow, bag full of unleaded
I don't get enough credit 
Don't sleep!
M-M-M-M-M-M
They done fucked up, huh?
The biggest bezzle, huh?
The don, Ricky Farrakhan, huh?
M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music
My weed burnin', my chain glitter
He's self made, Mac Miller my real nigga
Fuck who don't like it, bitch, come see me
Fuck who don't like it, hitta, hitta, hitta
G-G-G-Gettin' money so complicated, I'm the shit, I'm constipated
Yo baby mama, straight G, let me use the crib to mail all the weed
California, Atlanta, white girl in a black Phantom
My top down, mid-December, ride with a big black fat nigga
Krispy Kreme then it's chicken wings, introduce, different things
Jet skis and the best weed, think it's fake? Bitch, test me
I'm jet-lagged, don't need a stylist, pants sag, Jimmy Fallon
Blowin' green in the green room, Def Jam like, "Boss really wildin'"
Yeah, they hate but won't box a nigga
Bought the estate from a boxer nigga
Paranoid, I'm walkin' round
I'm butt naked with my chopper, nigga 
My chopper, nigga 
Hahahahaha! I'm butt naked with my chopper, nigga
Said I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniacYou feel like you're alone, Will? You have a soulmate? Somebody who challenges you. I'm talking about someone who opens up things for you—touches your soul. You can't give back to them, you know. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're always afraid to take the first step because all you see is every negative thing 10 miles down the road. But you can do anything you want, you are bound by nothing...
Yeah, are you my soulmate?
My angel, what do you want with me?
Too high , slow pace 
My eyes closed, your body all I see
I think you're too divine for my human mind
When I'm with you, what do you do? Bring me to life
No matter what, one day everyone dies 
You think you a God 'til you run out of time 
Yeah, said, when you're gone , what will you leave behind?
Yeah, do I belong sometime soon? Where goes my mind? 
You the one to show me
Divine love , love , love , love
Where was you when I was lonely
My divine love , love , love , love?
When the stereo plays our song, sounds so clear
Baby, where'd you go? What's so wrong?
I'm right here...
Yeah, why do you stay on my case?
I try to make you feel okay
Do you know  I'm in pain?
I give you clues, you misconstrued
You continue to push me far away
Why don't you come on in?
It's like you forgot my face
I just wanna taste of everything you made of
We ain't 
Cut the strings, my balloon, watch me fly
Yeah, said, when are you comin' through to free my mind?
Are you happy with your life?
Can I come and satisfy? Open up, let me inside
When you take off all your clothes, I am under your control
Rollin' up, you get me high  
You the one to show me
Divine love, love, love, love
Where was you when I was lonely
My divine love, love, love, love?
When the stereo plays our song, sounds so clear
Baby, where'd you go? What's so wrong?
I'm right here...Can you feel it?
Don't answer that, that was a rhetorical question
 rhetorical 
Forever life been never nice, we expedite the process
And every night I get advice, cause life is way too complex
Heaven's lights are hella bright, ironic how that came to be
But can't you see? This angel speaks
She's saying the place is safe for me
I told her "wait for me," the make believer normally disguise
Transform before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs
The morning rises and I'm fast asleep
Somewhere off in the master suite
Having dreams of Latin queens and nasty freaks
My mind, it wanders to places yonder and even farther
When I'm sleep walking I'm Stephen Jobs or I'm Peter Parker
A genius author, a Jesus preaching just to feed his daughter
The weed to spark up, yeah he's a goner, fuck these prima-donnas
I'll always wonder what happened 3000 years ago
I like to toy with the idea that we really know
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?
In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings
I'm wearing a blindfold, like, "Where did the time go?"
I know you hear me up there, give me a sign though
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Baby, I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Take me away, girl, somewhere they won’t be
Hold me closely, look at me, don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind go?
Said, will you follow me wherever my mind go?
I'm just trying to make it all make sense
As you hypothesize on how to monetize and take advantage of
All the time “we fall behind, get lost in this Aquarium
America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up
We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria
Confessions that I have and curiosity about life and death
Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest
Read about the meaning of dreaming and all its messages
Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes
We all in search for substance, that drugs you pain and numbness
Circumstances advance the second chances for this beloved
I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this coming
But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrows trend
Your life, it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained
Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days
Life, it works in such mysterious ways
All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say, ayy
I'm wearing a blindfold, like, "Where did the time go?"
I know you hear me up there, give me a sign though
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Baby, I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Take me away, girl, somewhere they won’t be
Hold me closely, look at me, don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind go?
Said, will you follow me wherever my mind go?
Wherever my mind goes
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?Hey
It's like
Long days, longer nights
You keep startin' fights, think you always right
Call you up to tell you I ain't comin' home tonight
Say you wanna leave me, it's just talkin', but I know you might
Now get along, I get along, I go
You sing along to every song that you know
You play your part, I'm playin' mine, you breakin' hearts, ain't breakin' mine
Since growin' old is takin' time, I'm actin' like I'm eight or nine
Tryin' to move on, talkin' to my old friends
See me, say what up and I'm actin' like I don't know them
Causin' so much problems, why you doin' that, doin' that?
Rippin' people's hearts out, you too cute for that, cute for that
I been on the same shit 
We run into each other and it's like we don't even speak the same language 
I guess people always goin' through changes 
Didn't think I would lose you once I got famous
Said, "Baby
I got missed calls and e-mails all going into detail
'Bout how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave
So go 
I'll be fine on my own" 
Said, "Baby, I got missed calls and e-mails all going into detail
'Bout how you used to love me, I keep changing like the leaves
Hell, go 
You'll be fine on your own" 
She tell me
"You an asshole, superficial douchebag
Wishin' that you knew that, you could have these shoes back
All of this perfume back, necklaces and jewels back
All the shit you buy me" she said, "I want you back
I can't be seen again with you and none of your friends
It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when
I thought you used to be the one, I guess you don't have time
'Cause all you do is grind and it's got me losin' my mind
You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to
Think I'm 'bout to lose you
I'ma end this now before things just confuse you
Kept breakin' promises you said you'd keep
So you can leave a message at the beep"
Said, "Baby
I got missed calls and e-mails all going into detail
'Bout how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave
So go 
I'll be fine on my own" 
Said, "Baby, I got missed calls and e-mails all going into detail
'Bout how you used to love me, I keep changing like the leaves
Hell, go 
You'll be fine on your own" Outside is cloudy, but I like that better 
Behind the wheel, but still ain't on my way
Some people say they want to live forever
That's way too long, I'll just get through today
Without any complications 
Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated? 
Well, I'm way too young to be gettin' old
And all I wanna do is look, but I can't see, baby
Who you talkin' to while you talkin' to me, baby?
Let me, let me know if I can see you later
We could make it easy
Inside my head is getting pretty cluttered 
I try, but can't clean up this mess I made
'Fore I start to think about the future
First, can I please get through a day?
Without any complications 
Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated? 
Well, I'm way too young to be gettin' old
Some people say they want to live forever
Without any complications 
Does it always gotta, does it always gotta
Gotta be so complicated? 
Well, I'm way too young to be gettin' oldBetter act right, 'cause I smack dykes
Give 'em blow and a bit of that bagpipe
Bitch wanna live that rap life, but I already hit that last night
Think you're fuckin' with me, huh? Must be hittin' that crack-pipe
I be makin' my money, thank God I learned how to add right
My cash like that cocaine, give me more, say, give me more
Don't worry 'bout it, ain't no thing, big titty hoes in my videos
Classy bitch, don't kiss and tell
Smack her ass and then wish her well
Life sucks, better give 'em hell
Get money, fuck girls, free Biggavel
A million in my briefcase, 'bout to shop for some real estate
'Bout to party with drugs though, turn it up, bitch, feel the bass
Throwin' money in your face, feelin' good, livin' great
Bad bitches in different states, it's like I think I'm Vincent Chase
With porn stars, sports cars, and my crib got a courtyard
How we get all this money though?
You know how big his tours are?
Greedy bitch, you a needy bitch
Want some money, but need some dick
And my belt monogram
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram, though
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram, though
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram

We in my black Benz, windows up
Gettin' head, smokin' blunts
Everybody know what's up, and I turn them girls to sluts
Crib's like a mob boss, my bitch get my car washed
We non-stop, my dick out, her jaw drop
'Cause all we do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck
All she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck
All she, all she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck
All she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck
Don't I look like a drug dealer? Don't I look like I'm somebody?
Killin' beats with that Murder Inc, don't I look like I'm Irv Gotti?
Ridin' through in my hippy van
You broke bitches don't give a damn
You softer than the Michelin man
Your bitch put her pussy on Instagram
Better go hard when my flow starts
They brand new with they old cars
Your pockets is on low carbs, she do a show, she a pollstar
In the penthouse, with the pants down
With the camera out, no hands now
Them hard drugs, we don't ran out
Can't believe that's somebody grandchild
She's so bad but I like it, wanna hear your pussy, I'll mic it
My credit card bill is righteous but, girl, that ass is so priceless
Spend the night with the right bitch, my dick ill, my pipe sick
Small pussy, tight fit, she loves to sniff that white shit
Fuck free, no charge, I play the pussy like Mozart
Eat that pussy, I won't starve
Love the pussy with my whole heart
Bitch named Layla my Clapton ho
Give me head, put the Benz in captain mode
And my belt monogram
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram though
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram though
When I die, bet she fuck my hologram
We in my black Benz, windows up
Gettin' head, smokin' blunts
Everybody know what's up, and I turn them girls to sluts
Crib's like a mob boss, my bitch get my car washed
We non-stop, my dick out, her jaw drop
'Cause all we do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck

All she wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck-fuck, fuckThis is madness 
This is an outrage! 
As a matter of fact, this is outrageous! 
Hahahah, yeah
Young sire, slap the fuck out Jon Cryer
Rough rider, raw bust inside a vagina
Like I want kids, my head continues to be haunted
I burn a city down while I'm unconscious
Maybe gon' take some quaaludes, conversate with Jesús
Batting practice with the mothafuckin' ghost of Babe Ruth
Do as a saint do, turn painful to graceful
Devil on my trails, I'm trying to find the Holy Grail
 Right there
And if Mars is the farthest that man has set his target
Then I don't know why I even started
I'm sick of being too nice to people who don't do shit but consume light
Told myself, "Fuck the world kid, just do what you like
Go and have a food fight, start yourself a new life
You're too bright to be inside a bunch of mediocrity
But all those big words ain't gon' get you paid
And those abstract ideas for sure won't get you laid
You got it made in that mad house
What the fuck you got to be sad 'bout? Go 'head and rap now
Do what you do best
I mean, that's what you do best
Matter fact mothafucka, you a suit vest, you need to buy a new dress
I heard you and your girl live in a duplex
I'ma put her ass in a suplex, the sun east, the moon west
You got a clue, what does a clue get? Nothing"
My milk and honey, my chérie-chérie amore
My Cinderella in her carriage by the doorway
Her ruby slipper made the wizard send the scarecrow
And the lion through the forest
To the Wicked Witch's fortress where she scorched them in the foreplay
Remember that? He said he'd fight the box to see the wizard
When he was visited by Dorothy who came here on a blizzard
Now the whole world's in color, still
How Auntie Em was next of kin but not her mother, real
Her face was careworn, I suspected she migrated to Kansas up from Dearborn
And had beef with Mrs. Gulch from the very beginning of year one
Mr. Candyman, the parables parabolic
The poetry's like the poems and psalms of Ecclesiastes
Lightning should strike the stone and then Moses should make a tablet
The Judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet
And yell "Hear hear", finally some order to this rap shit
Finally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips
I keep my shit crispy and elegant
So miss me with the irrelevant, the god body is heaven-sent
The hard-body is reverence, since the son of Byford
Brother of Fal, every rhyme's halal
Every line is kosher, livin' la vida loca
Shout out to Tony Toca, we ballin' like we suppose to...Yeah, it's been a while without your face
But I saw your picture on the wall the other day
Too much distance, too much space
You need to come back home or run along, yeah
I'm waitin' for the light to change
You ask me how I've been, well I'm good, I can't complain
Times get harder, things get strained
All I know, I don't want you gone
I know it hasn't been easy lately
But you don't wanna leave me, baby
And you know I hate to keep you waitin'
But when it's right, then it's right, yeah
Days turn into nights
Conversations turn into fights, we gon' be alright
Love turn into life
Girl, you been burnin' so bright, let me turn off the lights
Stay awake 'til the mornin', yeah
It ain't always great, but it's never borin', yeah
And I been itchin' for your love
Don't want to feel a single thing if it ain't your touch
I get drunk and become numb
Just want to stumble into us
But baby, don't stop now 'cause it ain't over, yeah
Few years ago I was so dumb
Clueless, young and stupid, but look at who I have become
I ain't gonna break your heart, promise it's always safe
Baby, don't go now, pull me closer
I know it hasn't been easy lately
But you don't wanna leave me, baby 
You know I hate to keep you waitin'
But I know when it's right, then it's right, yeah
Days turn into nights
Conversations turn into fights, we gon' be alright
'Cause love turn into life
Girl, you been burnin' so bright, let me turn off the lights
Stay awake 'til the mornin'
It ain't always great, but it's never borin'
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah

Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah 
But when it's right, then it's right, alright
Ooh-ooh, mhm
Ooh-ooh, mhm
Ooh-ooh, mhmBe without fear in the face of your enemies
Be brave and upright that God may love thee
Speak the truth even if it leads to your death
Safeguard the helpless and do no wrong
This is your oath
Yeah
Yeah, so how's it feel?
Can you feel it?
Uh, polo pajamas, I think I made it
I showed my mom my first million, she damn near fainted
The rich and famous, so nice to make your acquaintance
The legends put out their latest, I feel that it sound outdated
I'm the hardest workin' person in the universe
Temptation, victim to the church of Lucifer
Internet rappers ain't shit when no computers work
You spent your whole advance on two chains and a Gucci verse
 I'm the greatest, admit it, I'm the greatest
And I don't hold a grudge against anybody who hated
I'm underrated, don't fit on nobody's playlist
If I ain't in your top 10 then you a racist
Cocaine ether creates a strange creature
They wasn't hearin' me 'til I fucked with a Brainfeeder
I'm still playin' it out the same speakers
I did it all without a Drake feature!
So many things that I've created
But this right here might be my favorite
They ask me how I feel, I say, "Amazing"
I feel amazing
So many things that I've created
But this right here might be my favorite
Yeah
Brand new home, I think I made it
Key to the city, I keep to open the gates wit'
A briefcase with a million under the pavement
That's just on some rainy day shit, yeah
The kids gettin' murdered that I grew up wit'
They shootin' up, doing drugs or they doing nothin'
My girl's parents still livin' out in the hood
I come through in that new Beamer like the shit all good, damn
I'm just a human, let me make mistakes
Shit has changed, ain't little Malcolm with the baby face
Even my homies tell me, "Take a break"
They know it ain't their place, and this a day I hate to waste
Tryna be a legend by tomorrow
They say I can't, I'm determined to prove 'em wrong though
I'm not perfect but they ain't either
I did it all without a Jay feature!
Golly, you hear a lot of savage and unnatural things about people these daysYeah, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
Said
Where are you goin'? Can I come too?
The whole world is open, a playground for me and you
And we could be fine, shit, who the hell knows?
It's your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your nose
Head and your shoulders, your knees and your toes
I dream of this moment
Will it come true?
The whole world, they know it
They just waitin' for me and you
And she, just like I
Got her head in the clouds
Don't need to be lower
Before it's all over, I promise we'll figure it out
I ain't comin' down
Why would I need to?
So much of this world is above us, baby
They might tell you that I went crazy
I'm just tryna read you
Ooh, ooh, oohh
Ooh-ooh-oohh
I know we try
And the days, they go by
Until we get old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow
People, they lie
But hey, so do I
Until it gets old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow
Let it go, let it be
We're all we need today
Let it go, let it be
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Yeah, well
Sometimes I get lonely
Not when I'm alone
But it's more when I'm standin' in crowds
That I'm feelin' the most on my own
And I know that somebody knows me
I know somewhere there's home
I'm startin' to see that all I have to do is get up and go
Goin', goin', goin' before I'm gone
Gotta get goin', goin', goin' before I'm gone
Ayy, and I know we try
Days, they go by
Until we get old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow

Ain't got a choice, no, she do it cause she have to

No respect, 'cause you wear a v-neck 
I mean stress, pressure that could even make Keith sweat

I'm a grade-A douchebag, I'm a dickhead
Asshole area where my gooch sag
Little momma got salty at me, she started talking tough
So I called the Wolf Gang up, they start to bark it up
Popped a hundred mollies, fifth of sherm, think I was sparking up
A bottle of Zima, the Bimmer, I started parking up
Seen my nigga, Mac, and he hopped in the back

Um, I'm at IHOP to eat with Tyler 
Drink cocoa then double-team Mariah 
But please, don't tell Nick
We were all watching movies at a Motel 6 
Like ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
I hope Kendrick fucked Gaga 
If Madonna on the Kabbalah
Then me and Snoop could chill and be Rastas
I don't need Prada to show you I'm rich
Pulling out the llama like, "Show me your tits"
Keep crying 'cause I still ain't over my bitch
Oh well, it'll be okayYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's worth it
Who really has the time at all?
It ain't perfect but I don't mind
'Cause on the surface I look so fine
But really I'm buggin', buggin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'
Yeah, as hard as it gets: cool, calm and collected
Holdin' my breath, this ain't what I expected
Don't argue to death, pull my heart out my chest
The cards is all on the table, I'm callin' it
Don't say it, I swallow it
When livin' off of borrowed time
Often I'm on the fence, on a line
Addin' up what's on my mind
My feet on the clouds, head on the ground
That we goin' down, bet you know me now
I'm treadin' water, I swear
That if I drown, I don't care
They callin' for me from the shore, I need more
Well, it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's worth it
Who really has the time at all?
It ain't perfect but I don't mind
'Cause on the surface I look so fine
But really I'm buggin', buggin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'
Yeah, it feel like the weekend on a Tuesday, I can move dates
"I got somethin' else to do" day, always do hate
If I do say, the D'USSÉ with the homies like it's Kool-Aid
Me? I'm just tryna play it cool, J 
Yeah, mind over matter, I'm purer than alkaline
Been stuck on album time, I gotta get out to shine
Fly on the wall, shit, I was buggin'
Miss me like you gettin' withdrawal, I keep that comin', yeah
I'm treadin' water, I know
If I stop movin', I'll float
They nothin' new, it—
Just play it cool, baby, just play it cool
You know, cool
Well, it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's worth it
Who really has the time at all?
It ain't perfect but I don't mind
'Cause on the surface I look so fine
But really I'm buggin', buggin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'
Yeah, tell me you love me, spin me around
Pretty please, pick me up in the air and don't put me down
Seen it all unfold, sat back and watched
Knowin' time don't give a fuck about clocks until they stop
Bare feet, runnin' late, her car started
Even though the only thing that she drivin' a hard bargain
More important is I'm kinda sorta out the door but
She put me back together when I'm out of order
PerfectClarity...
Clarity...
Clarity
Figure all this out, I ain't gonna take a charity
Marry me
Wish everyone could shake and play the tambourine
Perfect
I know I love you, I ain't tryna let those words slip
Pure bliss
I knew that we would stay together, we in cursive
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Infatuation
When every single move you make is fascinatin'
Gravitatin'
Towards anything that gives a sense of happiness
Activist, love activist
Sendin' my love for girls who got some cuts at their wrists
Hope you found what you lookin' for
I hope you find what you lookin' for
You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm payin' you back
I'ma be waitin' for that
I'ma be waitin' for that
Misery
You represent love, you the epitome
So wish for me
I'll come out of nowhere—your epiphany
Disconnect
From everybody who don't understand my vision yet
In a jet
Is where my mind is, so I light another cigarette to calm me down
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So calm me down
Everybody who can save me now is not around
Chopper down
Busy today, but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds?
In between
Purgatory ain't as bad as it would seem to be
Live a dream
That's so cliché, but I can tell you what it means to me
You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm payin' you back
I'ma be waitin' for that
Said, I'ma be waitin' for that
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-ohYep, yep, yep, yuh, yep, yep
I don't got a reason to lie, they gave me the key to the sky
But I'd rather open my eyes, 'cause that's what'll keep me alive
Somethin' that's easin' my mind , please do not fuck up my day 
Everybody wanna headline, I don't got nothin' to say
'Cept I'm comin' back with the freshness, you know I love makin' a entrance
Now now, don't get defensive, time is a matter of seconds, one, two, yeah
Off to see the wizard, lead the picture, me and liquor, evil mixture, demon splitter
Cleanin' whiskers, he be Mr. Fisherman, back on my shit again
Doin' my own dance, feel the rhythm that's no hands
I tell ya vision like programs, busy livin' on triple digits, young old man
Y'all dead wrong, I'm upper with the echelon
So butter when the bread long, I'm goin' strong 'til my head gone, 'til my head gone
Yeah, floatin' back up on the scene, I'm sayin' hello 
Do my thing, I'm pullin' strings like Tom Morello
I keep it movin', you be doin' way too much
I ain't tellin' time, just tell you when it's up 
Yeah, I'm only keepin' good company
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me
Yeah, one for you and one for me 
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me 
Yeah, I mean wow, do not touch that dial, I've waited a while
Been around, just like word of mouth, you gon' hear me out, and I-
And I, and I, and I put that on my house
I'm always goin' overboard, I better swim before I drown 
I'm like rubber with the bounce, hundred be the count
Drummin' loud as thunder with the sounds, yeah
I was younger, fuck around, every summer wild
Always had it jumpin' at the house
Yeah, clappin' for y'all , I'm into havin' it all 
Feelin' like Shaq with the call 
Stature is tall , rollin' around with the homies
A battery pack on my dawgs 
Fuck with my thoughts , havin' enough ain't a lot 
Puttin' a check in the box, straight to the top , it don't matter
Never mind the pattern when you takin' your shot, woo!
Yeah, enough with the bullshit, enough with the bullshit
Enough with the extras, fuck all my money
I swear I been through it 
Fuck all the losin' , that's just an illusion
Gotta keep them comin' back for more to keep it movin' 
Yeah, I'm only keepin' good company
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me 
Yeah, one for you and one for me
I am not talkin' to you if you don't have love for me 
Follow me, I know the way 
Yeah, you know you better stand
Goddamn, put yo' hands together
Everybody got money, get the band together 
Movin' like you can't stand the weather
But it ain't gon' rain always
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahTake your time, when talkin' to a nigga I don't waste none
Knock you off your feet and then I flee before the jakes come
Sick of hearin' cases from these niggas who ain't face none
But I'ma be the nigga that they feelin' when the day come
Thirsty for the pay, young niggas led astray
Stray bullet hit my brother in his mothafuckin' face
What's fate when a person don't deserve what he get?
Shootin' reckless at the father, almost murdered the kid
Or is it karma for the shit that both the parents had did?
Ain't embarrassed where I'm livin', we get merit for kills
From a family of niggas that was veteran skilled
Voted heartless cause my momma made me part of the guild
Deals made, sellin' thrills paid the bills at the crib
Drag him down by the river, he'll be missin' for years
And them funerals was usual, I ain't sheddin' no tears
Knew the fallen had it better off than most of us did
'Cause shit, Heaven knows, Heaven's gates prolly closed
And these hoes in a race for the gold
We was raised on that fork in the road
No food on our plate, just the meals that we stole
Yeah, oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, um
I spit that prayer hand emoji, that shit that injured Kobe
The holiest of holy, Nick Nolte in some Oakley's
That's a flex though, cover up the issues that I kept close
Sober I can't deal, I'm in the corner with my head low
Runnin' from my shadow, never ending chase
Ease the pain and the battle that's within me
Sniff the same shit that got Whitney, the high heel depression
My temple feel the metal comin' out the Smith & Wesson, bang
Say a prayer, leave my brains on the tile floor
My bitch hate me, always tell me I should smile more
Off them drugs that hit you in your spinal cord
This the shit I need to keep the climate warm
Wish I could get high, space migration
Pretend I can just fly to great vibrations
The magazines need a quote
When I'm gone, sorry, I don't leave a note, yo
Woah-oh-oh, yeah
And this pain, and this pain
And this pain, and this pain
Mixed up with this rain, this rain
This rain, this rain, woah-woah-woah-oh-oh
Yeah, oh-woah-oh, yeah
Yeah, 9th Wonder*Woman panting*
You hide your skin like ya shy or did somethin' wrong
You stylish when you got nothin' on, yeah
And all I do is make these fuckin' songs
So, finally, I made a fuckin' song
And now she comin' closer
Hope she crawls, she wanna jump my bones
You want it, don't ya?
I was a soldier, now I'm comin' home, the war is over
Kick down the door, I hold your bends, you never break
You need to smell your sweet aroma
See, I knows you smell like cinnamon, kissin' your lips
I lick my fingertips and get your clitoris in the mix
My dick on business trips
My tongue twistin' is ticklin' just a little bit
I'm swimmin' inside of your skin like a river
In the Caribbean
It's okay that you like it, babe 
And it's alright that you misbehave
It's okay to be this way 
To live this way, baby, baby 
Chillin' with the AC
 That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks, here we are
 I'm takin' care of each and every part
I open up your legs and go straight for your heart
The way we are, the way we are
Said I'm too divine, I'm too divine, yeah; too divine
Who am I? Well; I'm Mr. Superfly
I'm Mr. Ooh-He-Blew-Your-Mind, hot as June, July
I wanna make your waterfall
Girl, you my paintin', you my art installation
Gonna fuck you, put you on the wall
All I wanna do is show you off, I want to put you on
Why would I ever blow you off?
Right now, let's go get lost
Jet, I've been way too high for way too long
I'm so exhausted
Whether that's your mind or line, we still get crossed
First your name is gone
Never understand until you have to stand alone
Can I have a hand to hold?
A Band-Aid for my damaged soul, I paint the planet gold
I swear I'm Michelangelo, I don't understand these hoes
They didn't want a man when it was, "Man, I'm broke"
And now they know me and what I don't need
You gon' see it's gon' be what it's gon' be
 That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks, here we are
 I'm takin' care of each and every part
I open up your legs and go straight for your heart
The way we are, the way we are
These hoes
These hoes
Taste this, taste, taste this
These hoes
Taste this, taste, taste this
These hoesI been waiting so long 
To have you by my side 
I, I can't do no wrong 
With you by my side, you are my...
Euphoria 
Euphoria 
And when you look in my eyes
The pain goes a-way
Euphoria 
You feel so damn good 
Just come take my hand  
And we could go to the moon
Look in my eyes as we land 
Euphoria 
Euphoria 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And when you lay in my arms
The pain goes a-way
Euphoria , euphoria
Euphoria 
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Euphoria , euphoria
Euphoria
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Euphoria, euphoria
And when you're mine, I won't let you go
The pain, it can't stay
Euphoria
Euphoria Uh, looks like I wrote this song on paper
First time I did that in like three years
My handwriting is—, is horrible and I can barely read this
Hmm
Hey, hey, don't even know what's in my head anymore though
Uh, figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso
Fuckin' girls, but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of drugs that enterin' my brain
All of a sudden, every legend keep on mentionin' my name
All that does is show me that my life will never be the same
Police tryna figure out how to get me locked up
I tell those cops, "Suck dog nuts," haha
Arrivin' to the party in a chariot
Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit
I'm very sick, yes, very ill
Eternal Sunshine, Jim Carey feel
At the amusement park, scared of heights, Ferris wheel
Double dare me to kill?
Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere you go, these people hate on you
It's déjà vu, déjà vu 
A little soul like De La do
They say I'm new, nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere I go, these people hate on you
Déjà vu, déjà vu
Wind chimes, sick rhymes
Been high on this incline
Tryna get my money stackin' tall, 6'9"
Have some caviar, sip wine
Sacrificin' sanity, sacrificin' normal
Purpose is for people in the plural
Form never formal, an art form, not a mural
Work four bars that are tighter than your cornrows
See a girl that's lookin' horny in the fourth row
Ha, I just put it in her mouth, ortho-
Dontist, manipulatin' phonics, put 'em into sonnets
Let me put you on this, nastier than Nas is
Bubonic plague, bacteria that's tryna find a way
Spread, like yolk of a broken egg
Talkin' shit? You just diggin' your grave
Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm new, it's nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere you go, these people hate on you
It's déjà vu, déjà vu
A little soul like De La do
They say I'm new, nothin' but some déjà vu
Everywhere I go, these people hate on you
Déjà vu, déjà vu
Hypothetically of dope, I kick incredibly
Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy
No methamphetamines, hot, 110 degrees
Visually stunnin', gotta see it on the LED
When I was 17, I thought I had it figured out
Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route
It's crucial, three new schools, life with a spoonful
Of sugar, yeah, I need my medicine
Fuckin' Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president
Represent all these fuckin' people that I never met
Some expect me to be the greatest ever
Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever
Now I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations
I'ma be the best, have some patience
You thought that it was great, then poof
It was nothin' but some déjà vu
Haha, yeahYeah, well, you could be my...
Said you could be my...
Yeah, you could be my...
Yeah, okay, well, you could be my...
Baby, you could be my...
Said, baby, you could be my...
Yeah, uh, well, okay, it's alright, it's okay

Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
Said you could be my...
Well, you ain't in the mood to argue
Baby, don't you worry, this some shit to get along to
Some shit I right my wrongs to
Well, I've tried to call you, have us a discussion
We never talk, we always way too busy fuckin'
I'll think of somethin' to say, I always do
I'm in love with the way that you say my name
Every time it sound brand new
And you, always wonderin' what we'll be
I say we sound better than you or me
Baby, you could be my... 
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
Yeah, I feel like you could be my...
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I can be your...
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
Only if you be my...
It's alright, it's okay
Yeah, okay, and time will tell
If I'm alive and well, 'cause when I'm by myself
I find that I keep flyin' high, sometimes I must remind myself
That change is more than pennies layin' on the floor inside the well
You cross my mind, do not apologize for bein' fine as hell
I'm spinnin' here inside your spell, my mind has start to wander
Miss a day, I stay up late admirin' your posture
And you, always wonderin' what we'll be
I say we sound better than you or me
Baby, you could be my...
Yeah, okay, it's alright, it's okay
And, baby, you could be my...
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I can be your...
Okay, it's alright, it's okay
Yeah, only if you be my...
There's no more you or me, we are we, yes we are
And I can see, I can see, so much better 
And carefully, precious things fall apart
Just let them be, let it be, forever, oh
Lovin' me, in spite of me, bless your heart 
I can breathe, I can breathe, so much better 
I won't let anything tear us apart, no, no, no
We are we, we are we, forever
You could be my...
Okay, it's alright, it's okay
I feel like you could be my...
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I can be your...
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
Only if you be my...
It's alright, it's okay
You gotta deal with Mac Miller, bitch
HehehehahahWoo!
Okay, woo!
Yeah 
Yeah
I give a fuck less and less every day 
The more you give a fuck, I guess the less you make 
Homie we just out here tryna elevate 
Heaven is a crime scene, stay behind the yellow tape 
I started makin' money in eleventh grade
Soon as I learned that the more you do, the less you wait 
Got a bigger crib, always use the extra space
Shit was so different in 2008 
Growin' pains, fill the open veins with Novocain
Relapse, I eat that, I don't complain
I'm just ramblin'
You want war? It’s N64, Blitz Champion 
Out of space channelin', brain-damagin'
Heavy rain, game cancelin', proud to be American, yeah
They tell me, "Get yourself straight 
How much more money can you make?" 
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich 
Maybe get married to a local bitch 
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit 
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness 
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich 
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness 
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit 
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness 
I'm a deranged motherfucker , took too many uppers 
Now it's rush hour, Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, yeah 
I stuck around the past six summers 
Karma is a bitch and that bitch don't love ya, yeah
We was in the attic, you could smell the weed
Bitches gettin' naked, we was selling E
Bitches kissin' bitches just like Ellen D 
In the kitchen whippin' biscuits, givin' generously 
I thank the Lord I made it out, no STD 
Lost a few too many brain cells, I'm special needs, yeah
They tell me, "Get yourself straight 
How much more money can you make?"
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich 
Maybe get married to a local bitch 
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit 
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness 
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich 
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit 
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness 
Ladies and gentlemen in attendance, good morning
It's the BabyFace Don Dada checking in
And I want you to know
It ain't about complaining, it's about maintaining
Y'know I'm talking about?
Don't ever become content because you will repent
Ya feel that? Go get it
That's your life, go live it
Pass me my Hennessy and my Grand Marnier
If you will"The hallucinations have stopped, finally, thank God, but uh, my adrenaline reserves are burning out and I'm staring straight into the face of a total psychotic freak-out."
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
A little louder
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
And if by chance this is my grand finale
Bury me in Allegheny County, it's the
The most hated, so faded that I'm bow-legged
Don't bathe, gross gang, smell like old Lo Mein, shit
The flow dangerous, make you wanna do the wave
Throw your bitch right off your lap and start a standing ovation
The most strangest, master of the ceremonies
A fifth of Stoli then it’s only Cher and Moby karaoke
My bitch a shooter, call her Annie Oakley
Get you for a pair of Kobe's, just got out on probation
And no famous friends for me, just old faces
I only go places wasted like I'm Joe Namath
Not a king, I'm no David, music, I'm a crackhead
No hobbies and recreation, don't even know my address
Self-medicate, self-education
Rick Rubin showed me transcendental meditation
Let us have a grand finale
The world will be just fine without me
The clown got a smile on his face
Slow it down, we goin' out with a bang
Are you ready for the fireworks?
It was a silent night 'til the fireworks
Yeah, okay, I
I fear nothin' on this odyssey of dark roads
God lives in my dog's soul, the devil in his dog bowl
We are the prophets, Jesus was a poor sport
He booted Nostradamus, turned water into wine
But he loved the gin and tonic, had skeletons in his closet
Even God will one day be forgotten
And recently I been feelin', I been feelin' like
It'd be really nice to get to sit with Mickey Weiss
Shoot the shit 'bout life, he'd be pissed I'm sniffin' white
Never got to see me grow up, how long it take to live a life?
I'm a bit surprised that I'm even still alive
Mixin' uppers and downers practically suicide
My old Jewish mind, REMember music, you'll be fine
And I make my own beats now, if you behind
Hallucination's how I use my mind
Who am I?
Let us have a grand finale
The world will be just fine without me
The clown got a smile on his face
Slow it down, we goin' out with a bang
Are you ready for the fireworks?
It was a silent night 'til the fireworksSoul!
Ever since a nigga had recess
Mothafucka felt like a grownup 
Momma come and bitch about a curfew
I was still playing 'round the corner
7 years old saw my first porno, damn, that fucked me up
At 10, I bust my first nut on this older ho gut, but so what
Let's recap, the earth spinning too rapid
I'm living too fast, sinning's a habit
I can't hack, fornicate, act this rabid
One bean short of an acid tablet
Security guards spark my cigarettes
The old head go 'head and cop me a brew
Sometimes them Koreans be cool
These shades make me look 22
They say you learn when you get older
I just say that that ain't true
That just means when you was younger
You ain't get turnt up like us, fool
Just got Ls so I'm riding high, still in high school but I do
Everything I will do, when I'm 25, no lie
I was young with ambition, fucked around with these hoes 
Never needed permission, went and lived the life that I chose 
Premonition-type visions, you see the world as it goes 
Tell 'em all what they missing, while I watch it as it unfolds
I'm dodging my death, confident kid
I was tryna grow up with the best 
Watching my step, never no college plan
Found myself nodding off always on test-day
I coulda been a great graduate
Woulda got one of them hoes from "The Bachelor"
Could've been smart, could've been a doctor
Life full of drama, little soap opera
Falling in love, lucky that I caught ya
Almost got her knocked up, would've been a father
All about energy, make good memories
I'm the fucking Dalai Lama 
Only 18 but I had my own business
Then I got fame like "what the fuck is this?"
Whole bunch of cameras, fake ass bitches 
Everyone around wanna treat me all different
Oh I'm cool, cause I got money? 
Back in high school none of these hoes was tryna fuck me 
I thought it was a conspiracy
Sometimes my thoughts start scaring me
You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit's for the parakeets
They, they, they been looking for somebody like me
Big bag of weed and a muddy iced tea
Something brand new, wonder what it might be
Coughing off them drugs, moving at a nice speed
If you 18 years and older
18 years and older
If you 18 years and older
18 years and older
I wanna rule the world, take care of my family
And take care of my girl, plant a couple seeds
Blaze a gang of trees
Went to see a rated R movie about me
They said you must be
18 years and older
18 years and older
18 years and older
18 years and older
18 years and olderYeah
Yeah, um
Uh
Ladies and gentlemen
Yeah
Whew, that drip
Yeah, okay
Writin' on writer's block, haven't slept in days
They wanna put me in the psycho watch, everyone's afraid
Of what I do inside my studio, worried I'ma lose control
They rufflin' my feathers and they shufflin' the Yu-Gi-Oh!
Execution flow, at your neck like new cologne
Uno, dos, bitch, I'm in your head like Freddy Krueger though
My brain fried, always chasin' the same high
I'm too fucked up to function, do nothin' but waste time
Woke up annihilated, lyin' on the pavement
Covered in items I regurgitated under a fire escape
And I know that it's Friday, 'cause every Friday they have a parade
In-front of city hall, hear 'em celebrate, they havin' a ball
My pupils dilated, highly dehydrated, I'm lost inside a giant matrix
Isolate myself from eyes I find contagious
Jump above the comedown
I'm strung out, noddin' off inside the dugout
Don't be scared, just come with me, yeah
Feels so good to feel this free
What are you afraid of? Tell me what you made of
What are you afraid of? It's just a little angel dust!
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da, la-da-da 
La-da-da-da  la-da-da-da 
La-da-da-da, ayy 
Yeah
I'm playin' hot potato on a Winnebago
The chips are stale, they taste okay though when they dipped in queso
And what's an angel with a missin' halo?
She would drop outta school to take a trip to DayGlow
Found a twenty layin' by the sewer rats
You know little Stuart hasn't been in any movies lately
He's spent his paychecks on cocaine and latex
His agent workin' hard to try and book him a commercial
What I do should not concern you, do this 'til I turn blue
Not Eric Sermon, I'm more Merlin, curses turn 'em into bird food
Hurry to make the first move, I'm walkin' like Herschel
And now we at the end of verse two, oh
Don't be scared, just come with me, yeah
Feels so good to feel this free
What are you afraid of?  Tell me what you made of 
What are you afraid of? It's just a little angel dust!
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
La-da-da-da, la-da-da 
La-da-da-da, la-da-da-da
La-da-da-da, ayy

Please don't fuck with the angel dust
Oh

Aw shitGet high, breakin' laws
Get high, breakin' laws
Yeah
Okay, I wake up with the taste of pussy still in my mouth
Bitch in my bed, homegirl still asleep on the couch
My head is bangin' like Metallica, swallow a bottle of Advil up
Then head back to the bedroom where she suck me dry like
Dracula
It's The Young Miraculous Mister Love-to-Grab-His-Nuts
Never let a bitch inside, fuck her in the Acura
Aurora borealis with the shine, my aura gorgeous
Dinner with 40 courses, bunch of horny whores who fornicate
To formulate a fortune, more in the race of horses, I am
My homies got my back, they all Verizon 
I bring this to you la-la-la-la-la-la-live, man
You gon' need at least five hands to hold my finance
I am fe, fi, fo, fum, the giant
The best thing out of Pittsburgh since Clemente with the Pirates
I tell 'em, "Shhh, this middle finger sign for silence"
Ain't a fuckin' way I'm keepin' quiet
Yeah
I been ridin' through the city, blowin' smoke out the window 
Cops is on patrol, they lookin' out for all the crim'nals 
I been a lot of things, I ain't never been a bitch though 
Rules to the game  you know how this shit go 
Get money, fuck the system, break the law 
Get money, fuck the system, break the law 
Get money, fuck the system, break the law 
Oh no 
La, la, la 
So many people told me that I wouldn't be shit, but now I walk
Around with money and my hand on my dick, I think I'm special
I'm drinkin' whiskey out the bottle 'til I black out
One million, two million, shit, I'm losin' track now
 Comin' to you live inside the crack house
Started with a dub and then I made it to a half ounce
Then I turned it to a pound  turned that to a house 
Turned that to a career, how the fuck did I get here? 
Spendin' all your time just gettin' high will drive you crazy
 I killed the game like Jeffrey Dahmer did the '80s
Speedin' down the freeway gettin' head in my Mercedes
Givin' me all of this money was crazy, shoulda known better, no pressure
Dope seller, smarter than your professor
Hoes, I don't stress her, put a bitch down like Old Yeller
The flow's stellar, stella ella ola
Have you ever been? Shit, I pro'bly could've been the president
Yeah
I been ridin' through the city, blowin' smoke out the window
Cops out on patrol, they lookin' out for all the criminals
I been a lot of things, but I ain't never been a bitch though
Rules to the game, you know how this shit go
Get money, fuck the system, break the law 
Get money, fuck the system, break the law 
Get money, fuck the system, break the law 
Oh no 
La, la, la, la

Break the law, break-break, break-break the law 
Break the law 
Break the law 
Break the law 
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-laI'm so close I can taste it
The man on the moon keep playing
Practical jokes, planting the mirrors and smoke
That I fade away in
You be complaining
And I can't explain it
I guess, nothin' compare to the feeling
The feeling amazing
Now I'm switchin' location
'Cause Heaven too far when you live in the basement
I'm lookin' for balance, I'm in an oasis
Well, I need somebody to save me, hmm
Before I drive myself crazy
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, show me something
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, something I can see
Yeah, don't tell me to stop
Let me keep goin' until I cannot
Life is a fantasy until you wake up in shock
Hittin' the ground, I'm hittin' the ground, I fell from the top
You never expect to drop, so hold on, but
That just the way it goes, your God don't wait for no one
And when that's all you know, it keep you on your toes
You got so far to go, but look at where you came from
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, show me something
And all I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, something I can see"Have I answered the question, 'Who am I'? Mm-hmm. Well, I confront it all the time
We're teaching people how to use their head. The uh, point is, in order to use your head, you have to go out of your mind. You have to go out of all of the, uh, the esthetics and all the ways in which you think."
If it was colors and shapes, the imaginary
'Stead of all of this weight that we have to carry
Would you be able to breathe?
And if you could just find where that comfort resides
No distraction or movement that fucks wit' your mind
Would you let them see?
While beneath the ocean, I met with the captain
Who sank to the floor on his ship
All of his passengers escaped to safety
But he was not done with his trip
He looked up and smiled, asked me, "How do you do?''
I told him, "I'm losin' my grip"
He told me, ''Son, if you want to hold onto yourself
Then let yourself slip''
Fall, ooh
Fall, oh
Fall
Oh, it feels good to fall
Ooh, ooh
These puzzles are so hard to make into pictures
Of something that they'll understand
They could open their eyes, still be blind to the beauty
But march on the heart of this land, oh oh
Why don't you turn around and go home?
They invade your minds and then fill them with nonsense
These things that a man doesn't need
Take out the love and the passion and hope
And they fill it with nothing but greed
While floating through galaxies, they said I couldn't
I noticed how sad one can get
'Cause the ignorant mind is so peaceful, I find
I can't understand nothing no more
If I jump, let me...
Fall , ooh
If I jump, let me
Fall, oh
Fall
Oh, it feels good to fall
Ooh, ooh
"Think for yourself
Don't accept something because an authority tells you to"K.I.D.S
Hey, Kool-Aid and frozen pizza
It's a work of art, I ain't talking Mona Lisa
Dream of rocking crowds, see me filling up arenas
This weed got me laughing like a damn hyena
Yeah, I live a life pretty similar to yours
Used to go to school, hang with friends and play sports
Every single summer taking trips to the shore
And that was all gravy but I knew I wanted more
Ain't ever seen a young rapper like moi
Can't believe they eyes, swear it's just a mirage
Still got my training wheels in the garage
But I ain't gonna need those, I'ma go hard 
So far I've done pretty well for myself
Couple trophies on the shelf, so what else
Could I want that I don't have yet?
Well, a little more cash and my own fast jet
So I can go anywhere,  anywhere 
Cali for the kush, 'cause boy I know there's plenty there
'Bout to be in music stores everywhere, but not yet
They can't understand my concept
I've been climbing up the great wall, haven't had a fall yet
These blogs gotta know I'm on next
Clean conscience, good Samaritan
Companies send me clothes so I'm wearing them
If you didn't know, well, I'm from the 'Burgh
Everything I drop recorded by Big Jerm
I smoke herb, then I make music
I don't even talk about it, boy, I just do it
Everybody got their own opinion, the reasons why they feeling him
You must admit he's killing 'em, running off adrenaline
Waiting for the game to wanna let him in, so open up
The boy a barrel of a smoking gun
Whether I'm old or young, the chosen one
I got a hundred billion flows to come
I hope you know the lyrics to every single song
So when I'm at a show everyone can sing along
My weed bag empty, bottle at its last drop
I'm feeling like this could be my last shot
But many more songs to make, cousin
So why the fuck you bugging? Haha
Yeah

And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gonna try to have a good, good time
I think you know the reason why, yeah
Feel like I've seen a million sunsets, yeah
If you're with me I'll never go away
That's when I stopped and I took a look at my baby
She said, "If you're with me, I won't go away"
Because everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gonna try to have a good, good time

Self-employed, independent, once you start, don't take no breaks
Work until I get it, I bet it's gon' take a second
But once I start up my engine, I'm gone, too fast to catch him
I'm Lennon mixed up with UGK, maybe try that purple drink
What I'm on is strong, yours weaker than seven days
You sweeter than crème brûlée, presidential head of state
Dopest mothafucka since before I hit the seventh grade

Rollie on my wrist, I ain't rich, but I'm still coppin' shit
Jerm is on the beat, he got that heat, hold up, drop it quick
And bring it back
I could change the world with just a single track
Underage table in the back, smokin', drinkin' yak
Pittsburgh, let me show the world just where my city at
On the map, illest city out, I guess that's just a fact
I'ma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball

People tend to think all the drinks on me
I don't even have the money to spend
To buy Patrón for you and all your friends 
Baby, I be on my grind, rain, sleet, snow
Rollin' up good every place we go
'Cause we tryin' get high , get high , get high
Know the bullshit and all the problems, but we too gone to see
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
We proceed to give 'em what they need
Just wakin' up, then gettin' stoned
Rub my eyes and check my phone
Open up the fridge to make some waffles
But no more syrup left in my bottle, damn
Well, it's okay
I top it off with scrambled eggs, ayy
Gotta work with what you got, ayy 
Gotta work with what you got
Supposed to be in class, but I ain't goin'

Girl, we won't leave the house
Can you stay a while?
Can you stay a while?
'Cause, girl, I'm feelin' lazy
And I'm tryna hang around
Ain't tryna get out of my bed 'til noon
Neighbors smell the perfume, smoke in my room
And I got the door closed, can't be sure, though
Amsterdam weed, spendin' euros
Get the herb rolled, let's relax
Take your shoes off and kick it back
We escape the world, escape the stress
But I don't give a fuck if the house a mess
'Cause we gon' handle that later, we gon' handle that later
Right now, let's get this paper and smile for all them haters
Ayy, cream cheese and a bagel
Have a glass of milk and an Eggo
I'm rockin' PJs and no shirt
I smoke weed, eat yogurt
Enjoy the best things in your life
'Cause you ain't gonna get to live it twice 
They say you waste time asleep, but I'm just tryin' to dream
Supposed to be in class, but I ain't goin'
Let's chill on the couch
See what's on the telly
Girl, we won't leave the house
Can you stay a while?

Smellin' it when the L is lit, I'm flyer than a pelican
Young fresh, but I'm so damn intelligent
Girls givin' brains 'cause I'm acting like a gentleman
In deeper than the water Michael Phelps was in

Some devil with a pitchfork keep talkin' like he know me
I'm psychopathic, low-key, my hyperactive dome piece
Get no sleep, ill as fuck, the hospitals seem so weak
I stood before an Angel as he told me 'bout the glory
Put me in a room of people, how the fuck could I be lonely?
I only get money, these labels tryna clone me
Uh, my thoughts get heavy, hit the ground and crack the concrete
So, I try to keep 'em in my head
It's sad to see when everything that you believe is dead
Word to Heavy D, and rest in peace to all that come and pass
Life is good sometimes, but it just doesn't last
A bunch of stress, you see this mic is like my punchin' bag
Rock 'n' roll, drugs and cash, you softer than a bubble bath
Sucka ass ma'fucka, ma'fucka's sediment
Doper than the shit that killed Chris Tucker in Dead Presidents
Desert rhymes, homie, ridin' beats, I'm on a camel

To be in front of cameras in your underwear with Marilyn
Monroe-lookin' dumb hoes who want too much dough
And come close to have you straight trippin' when you jump rope
Don't rock the love boat, this business fuckin' cutthroat
And it's gonna crack if you just paint the wall with one coat
Rooms filled with blunt smoke, peep me through the fog
These rappers who be hatin' probably need to get a job
See, me, I'm with my squad, gettin' money, livin' comfortable
I know a couple hoes who model, but they ugly though
Fuck a toast, y'all is fuckin' broke, cut ya throat
Judgin' me is nothin' dope, boy, you lyin' under oath
God made the world, why did man make the scriptures?
And if he created Lennon, why'd he go and make a Hitler?
I could take a photo, but I'd rather paint a picture
Of the one Laurence Fishburne, we'll shoot up all you hipsters
I'm from Pittsburgh, that's black and gold
If my skin gets filled up, I'ma tat my soul
Runnin' out of paper, writin' on my hand
Hundred thousand haters writin' 'bout my jams

In the spaceship, shit is spaciousThey've got the best equipment that money can buy. Hell, every team they're sending over here has their own personal masseuse. Not masseur, masseuse. But, it doesn't matter! Do you know that every mohawk competitor has electrocardiogram, blood and urine tests, every 48 hours to see if there's any change in his physical condition? Do you know that they use the most sophisticated training methods from the Soviet Union, East and West Germany and the newest Olympic power, Trinidad & Tobago? But it doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! I tell you it just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! Even if we win... if we win, ha! Even if we win! Even if we play so far over our heads that our noses bleed for a week to 10 days, even if God in Heaven above comes down and points his hand at our side of the field, even if every man, woman, and child held hands together and prayed for us to win, it just wouldn't matter!

Caucasians still love me like my name was Michael Bolton
Hold on, do you fuckin' dirty like the soap gone

E'rybody trippin' that my mind ain't steady 
For my sin, shoulda been crucified already, rah!
Why the fuck you need me? 
Don't you know how to fly already?
Try and tell you that it ain't real 
Tell 'em, "Find that yeti" 
Oh 
Motherfucker 
And it all could end right now 
I never been so ready 
All my homies philosophers 
Yeah , all my homies philosophers 
And I don't need nobody, I would love somebody though
Don't you ever get it fucked up 
Everybody wanna be God
Besides God, he wanna be like us 
We ain't never sleep too much
Beat that pussy up, she gonna need that trust 
Never see me in the street too much
But on the inside, I'm outside, all the time 
Try and stay away from electric shock 
That electric shock, I'm outside
Faces, Faces, Faces, Faces
Faces, Faces, Faces, Faces
Faces, Faces, Faces, FacesThis tambourine
Shaker
Man, I think I'm Eric Andre
Man, I think I'm Louis C.K
Man, I think so therefore I am, man, It's 8AM
Man, my mind is an emporium of cute naked hoes
My brother one of the only ones I can confide in
It ain't no water in the pool, go 'head and dive in 
I toot my horn, I blow my bugle, I recycle
I say "free beluga whales" on YouTube, what do you do?
Okay
The pussy like trouble 'cause I'm in it often
A drug habit like Philip Hoffman will probably put me in a coffin
But down the slope in my toboggan
Three day delirium, gettin' weirder than Austin
Now it's seven in the morning, this rapper life is so boring
Still at it, the drug absorbent, endorphin addict, yeah
The evil follow me, I got a devil magnet
I know a bitch who'll let you fuck her for Coachella passes
Oh, so pompous, the ambiance
You remind me of the lobby of the Mondrian
I saw you meditatin', get your Gandhi on
If she got that stank puss, then I won't be long
Never lose your mind 'cause insanity is brutal
Life is just like college, all you have's your noodle
Mirror mirror on the wall, I'm staring at a dead man
Me and Mikey go back like Bron-Bron's headbands
The white American, hiding from the Aryan
New Tibetan Mastiff, and he hate it when you stare at 'im
Jump in, the jacuzzi on  say I fuck witchu the long way
I love you more than Kanye love Kanye 
Slave to the W, I don't hang with losers
I'm in the suburbs doin' drive-by's on Razor scooters
It's my first try, swear I got a third eye
It's work time, I sell the coke to students out in Irvine
Ehh, coming off the high, listening to Jamiroquai
Why we go through hell when we tryna get to paradise?
It's like we ain't scared of death but we scared of life
It's like we shootin' for the stars but we scared of heights
I'm in-doors, pair of gym shorts, with the Sith Lord
We might go bowling later, maybe play Connect 4
Get high, fuck her with the Tech Deck
Callin’ local middle schools and send in some death threats
Hey look
When I tell you this, I mean this seriously, from the bottom of my heart
I need the briefcase in 15 minutes
Or everybody's finished
I love my powder white, prefer my bitches black

The niggas pulled me over , asked me for my license and registration 
I give 'em my license and registration 
Then he got the nerve to tell me I smell like weed 
Nigga, you asked for my license and registration

I said good morning this morning and I'll say good night

We'll take the stairs that gets us into there
It's unfair when I'm being too proud, but
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know

One day I'm a get it all cleaned up, right now I'ma dirty my jeans up
This what I do, start the day, picture bring back all the pain
All that shit that's hard to say, had a vision, lost its way
This planet different that we live in, yeah, I bet it is
Product of the new world, you stuck in Genesis
And I'm just tryna rep my city right like Bettis did
I got a crazy girl that's filled with all these fetishes
Plus she can get me high when I'm feelin' low
Fill my cup with purple, baby, drink it slow
And I can take you anywhere you wanna go
Don't, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
I told her please don't take this back from me, this feelin' come so naturally
Exactly what I wanna do, I'm actin' so erratically
You get me high, hold me there, this is real, girl, don't be scared
It's only fair, I warned you that love a drug that can kill you
Got your open heart, I'd have it never, grow apart or last forever
Hopin' you'll remember what I tell you, lookin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid of what can get you high
Just hold me tight and watch the seconds fly
I, I, I, I
I wonder where will I meet the perfect girl that I dream of
For now I need no huge tits, I'm cool with just a good B cup
Uh, you're now free to ball, build it up then keep it all
She don't need to call, if love a landing then we could fall
Could we drop that and say everything that we've not said?
I'm telling you that you hard to trust, you sayin' I got a hard head
This forever, don't you ever think to let me go
And if I'm talkin' to the world, I need to let 'em know
She can get me high when I'm feelin' low
Fill my cup with purple, baby, drink it slow
And I can take you anywhere you wanna go
Don't, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
I told her please don't take this back from me, this feelin' come so naturally
Exactly what I wanna do, I'm actin' so erratically
You get me high, hold me there, this is real, girl, don't be scared
It's only fair, I warned you that love a drug that can kill you
Got your open heart, I'd have it never, grow apart or last forever
Hopin' you'll remember what I tell you, lookin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid of what can get you high
Just hold me tight and watch the seconds fly
I, I, I, IMornin' after, my lungs hurt
Eat your pussy just to show you how my tongue works
It's funny how we fucked but fell in love first
Been three years, I wish I finally trust her
She make me feel like how them drugs work
Itchin' for my fixture, when she gone the love hurts
I just get her temper, I just need somebody I can vent to
Someone get me stoned, be my Emma
Left your lipstick on the glass of your daiquiri
Ruby red, usually end up tragically
Work of art, you can be my masterpiece
But you fast asleep
Somethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more
Done a lotta drugs, never felt like this before
I hope one day it all makes sense
It'll all make sense
And you could have it all, tell me what you need
Believin' all them silly things you read
I hope one day it all makes sense
One day it'll all make sense
Uh
Then she wake up, cryin' while she puttin' on her make-up
Trapped inside her love for me, ain't no escape for
Her, you wanna leave?
Say the word, but she can't
Lookin' in my eyes, "Is everything okay?"
She lies, put on her disguise, play it safe
'Cause we've been fightin' for the past three weeks
She keep this one inside, she don't wanna seem weak
Strong, baby, tell me what's been goin' on
I don't wanna be sober long
So you need to get me high again
I got all this money we could try to spend
Until we strung out like a violin
Come back to life, then we die again
Little angel, where's your halo?
Somewhere above them horns
Somethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more
Done a lotta drugs, never felt like this before
I hope one day it all makes sense
It'll all make sense
And you could have it all, tell me what you need
Believin' all them silly things you read
I hope one day it all makes sense
One day it'll all make sense
Uh
You get me high, girl, scared to overdose
I don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose
May I propose a toast? Someone usually does
To our fucked up love
You get me high, girl, scared to overdose
I don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose
May I propose a toast? Someone usually does
To our fucked up love
Somethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more
Done a lotta drugs, never felt like this before
*Snorts*
*Exhales*
And you could have it all, tell me what you need
Believin' all them silly things you read
Don't cry, it's okay
It'll all be over soonThe good times can be a trap!
Oh yeah? Ha ha ha
Oh hell naw 
Not here
Check myself into rehab 
Yeah, um... I might die before I detox
Now that's a bar
I'm gonna save that one for a little bit 
Now let me come with- with somethin' else, you feel me? 
It's Air Jordan on my flip-flops 
And kill me now if I did it all for hip-hop 
I might die before I detox
This ain't high-school, no little Asian I can cheat off 
We keep chiefin' while police watch 
Loss in vibration sirens blowin' up the weed spot 
And Heisman hopefuls all growin' up to be cops
Chasin' after gangsters but they never find the G spot 
I'm recordin' like I'll die tomorrow 
At the rate I'm gettin' high, it'll be hard for me to find tomorrow 
But I just pray that I'll survive tomorrow 
As she cries in sorrow, she just needs some time to borrow 
She'll be smilin' by tomorrow
Everythin' will be so fine tomorrow 
Put the white away, we can do some lines tomorrow
Come say hi to Morrow 
Well I’ll be damned if this ain’t some shit
Well I’ll be damned if this ain’t some shit
Here I am
Oh... I know you see me
Here I am
Yeah... and I'll be damned if this ain't some shit but here I am!
I'm the only suicidal motherfucker wit' a smile on 
Let’s hold hands and sing the Bible, that’s a violent psalm
The high-strung, eyes-low, ride along
Everybody grab a fuckin' number, this a dieathon 
 Oh, I'm the bomb 
Literally back away, I'm the bomb 
Let me get my lion on 
Yeah, okay
85 grand get you a heavy ass wrist 
They ain't killin', they just yellin', that's it 
A deadly combination with that ecstasy sniff 
On the phone probably yellin' at Rich 
Say, double the money , please, double the money 
Triple the problems, double the money
They was all laughin', wasn't that funny? 
I started fucking with drugs and now I'm a junkie
The U-S of A, I fuck with my country 
But Uncle Sam could never teach me how to Dougie 
I'm thinking till my brain pops
Spittin' is a cake walk 
I'm just a rapper, guess I'm sticking to my day job 
Wiz gettin' faded, come and kick it at a bake shop
Everythin' is A-1, steak sauce
Goddamnit 
Thank God
Here I am and I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Here I am and I'll be damned if this ain't some shitLately I just been workin', writin'
Haven't really got outta the crib too much, heh-heh
As I spend another night without a single thing to do
'Cept writin' down this music I proceed to bring to you
My man Billy hit me up, he got some weed he bringin' through
Tell him better be that good and grab a pack of Swishers too 
That's what usually happens, deserve some cool relaxin'
Smokin' herb and laughin' at Curb Your Enthusiasm 
I'm just a regular kid 
Doin' regular shit 
I'm so high, another night alone
So I'ma pour another cup and roll another zone 
I'm gone, you ain't gonna bring me back 
So gone, couldn't tell you where I'm at 
Maybe New York, Philly, maybe Pittsburgh
You wanna find me? Hit me on Twitter, heh-heh
Wow, that sound mad lame
People love me, they don't even know my last name 
Waitin' at the station 'til it's time that I can board the train
Headin' to the fortune, fame, should explore my brain
See what I'm thinkin' 'bout 
Pour a little liquor, then I drink it down
'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone 
Said it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone, heh
I spend another night alone  
I turn my phone on silent, I need to get away
Put on J. Cole's Warm Up and let it play
I thank God for blessin' me with life every day
And to my peoples who've gone, we'll meet at Heaven's gates
I've been sellin' haze, but I'm sure there's better ways
That I can get my pay, I just need to get it straight
Nothin' left to say, now it's time for action
No more bullshit, no more relaxin'
Rappin's my passion, so I stay writin'
Spend a couple nights and burn out all the lights in
My room, stuck in my crib like glue
That's what I do, it's nothin' new
'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone  
Said it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone, heh
I spend another night alone  
Night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone, hehI'm a motherfuckin' fool , cut the check
I'm a workin' motherfucker, need a desk, shit
I don't got a heart, I don't even need a chest
I'm a mess, they be sayin' they up next, that's a stretch
Hold your breath, let me bow to the crowd, shit, I'm blessed
Well I must be, bitches want to fuck me, bump uglies on front street
The cards on the table, gin rummy
Have a blast, have a ball, have a motherfuckin' great time
Beast, I'm a dog, got a squad full of K-9s
I'm a motherfuckin' fool, cut the check
I'ma get it 'til there ain't shit left to get
No stress, runnin' suicides, don't even break a sweat
I'm a threat, code red when your line get pressed
You gettin' fucked by your contract, what the fine print says
Told you once; I told you twice; I get the lamb; it's over rice
I whip the Lamb, it's overpriced, the life is good—the hoes are dykes
This type of shit don't happen overnight 
I'm a motherfuckin' fool
This shit on one hundred degrees, hard as fuck, ain't in a rush

How convenient, undefeated
Walked up in Neimans, spent the sac then I'm leavin'
Smokin' on reefer, OG reekin'
If the cops pull me over they gon' want to take the Bimmer
But I'ma do the dash, beat it like Tina
And I got my nina, boy, you better be subpoenaed
Walked in the spot, ice on, lights on, blingin'
Someone start a fire 'cause it's fuckin' freezin'
I'm high off life, give me the blunt, I'ma roll it
I got hot rocks, I'ma let you hold it
I was posted with the hammer, y'all was tellin' police
Now I wrestle with the racks, bitch, I'm Mick Foley
Shit made me go, "Woo," like Rick Florer
I mean Ric Flair, bitch boy, I've been player
You a bench warmer, boy, I've been playin'
Walked up the stairs, look at my shoes like, "Them cleaner"
But I should've worn the other ones 'cause them better
This shit on one hundred degrees, hard as fuck, ain't in a rush
I let the money come to me, I'm a businessman
I'm way too young to be this rich
Don't know what to do with all this shit
I'm out of control, Lord, can you save my soul?

There's a birthday party happening upstairs 
And it's all for me, who the fuck cares? 
They don't notice if I never go and show my face 
They just looking for a reason they can celebrate 
I hate to waste the vanilla cake that they made for me 
I tell the same stories, they pretend they never heard 'em 
I'll just stay down here inside the studio 
Doing blow and paraphrasing The Crucible 
If you fucking with the God, that's a funeral 
Lose your soul, I’m witcha longer than your student loans 
Who got the ecstasy pills? I need a few to roll 
I'm a real drug addict, homie, you should know

Do you ever sit and wonder what is real? 
Do you ever reach to touch her but there's nothing there? 
Do you tell her that you love her but she doesn't care? 
Does she tell you that you hurt her and you're unaware? 
Did you hear about a heaven now you running there? 
Do you think about the fantasy and make-believe? 
Do you cover up your eyes, you can't wait to see? 
Lately, I've been having strange dreams 
Paranoid they hate me, everybody think I'm crazy
Baby, can you take me somewhere where the sky blue? 
You can lead the way, I promise I'll be right behind you 
I do see myself as iconic 
Getting high my downfall it's kinda ironic

Drunk and I'm swervin', I'm goin' ape-shit on all of my verses
Fuck bein' famous, I'm here to fuck up your favorite
Lately I'm hearin' too much of the same shit
Young and I'm faded, killin' shit, bury it under my basement
Shut your motherfuckin' mouth, bitch 
Fuck your motherfuckin' couch, bitch 
Yeah, you talkin', you ain't 'bout shit
Swear you a lame

Bitches in love with my face, yeah, I'm collectin'
I need that money todayYea, and I can't feel my legs, I'm a paraplegic
Lord, I want a fair one with my demons
Karen Meyers became married to Jesus
Born dead, they had to dig up my fetus
And now the devil want to tear me to pieces
I'm a diagnosed insomniac
An astronaut who blasted off into the stars galactic
On top of Saturn, fox-trotting with Velociraptors
The dino-aliens invaded Earth, so they could feed on hypochondriacs
Preparing for the rapture, closet hillbilly threw the spinners on the tractor
I listen to Uncle Kracker
But, that's white America for you, we all that matters
I'm walking backwards, shadowboxing with karate masters
It's more to rap, we sell the royal crack at Castle Rock
A bad apple like an unemployed Macintosh
We lost Jobs
Now they brainwashed with dot com
It's only so long until we surrender the free world to Hong Kong
And sinners stay still, but the merry go round, and round
It all just keeps spinning
Gotta keep swimming
Eat drink and let the merry go round
Eat drink and let the merry go round
I got a double sided silver dollar
Larry Fish here from midget league, beginner slaughter
I'm not drowning, I'm wading in the water
Killing off these monsters ever since I was a Sabra
I got horses on my PJ's
Shout to spitta jet life, I fit the Porsches on the PJ's
On stage, sending dark forces to my DJ
The birdies on tour like PGA
Davis Love III, Pittsburgh warrior
Bullets in my cornea
In exelsis Deo, ayo, this is Gloria
Ave, Ave Maria, I'm getting bread, yeast rise on Easter
Money is God
Black beaches with jungle fever I love to be on
You on the B-Team I fuck with Solange
All my life they said I doesn't belong
So I'm chilling, growing drugs on my lawn
And sinners stay still, but the merry go round, and round
It all just keeps spinning
Gotta keep swimming
Eat drink and let the merry go round
Eat drink and let the merry go round
Yeah, what what
Have you found a way out?

My mind are in the times when this love was so divine
But now it's feelin' like without ya
Feelin' like how the fuck did
We get into a place we ain't accustomed to lovin' inside of
I know I'm out of my mind more often than not
You know I'm used to givin' this all that I got, yeah
It's not a waste when that smile on your face
You tell me you outta place, you parked in my spot
Okay, baby, this a piece of cake
We could lay up on the beach, you could feed me grapes
This my favorite song, spin it ‘til the needle breaks
We could quit the whole game, do the real estate thing
It's how you beat the case
Put in work, turn that pussy to the office
Be on top of your game, this here a goddess
And I ain't here to break a promise
I'm just tryna keep it honest, and honestly
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Okay, no mishaps, this, that, and the third
Don't go back on my word, yeah, I keep that shit gift-wrapped
Your pussy a ride better than Six Flags, I'm in that
No takeaways, no givebacks
No question, we've been through adolescence
And changin' direction, yeah, I paid attention to it
It's never been easy but now it's gettin' ruthless
A little more pain, that's just better music
Girl, what's on your brain? 'Cause that head is stupid
Lotta people suck a dick, but you can execute it
Perfect timin', don't you add another second to it

You just landed from the Planet God Damn, damn
Wanna feel you feel me

What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
ספר לי על הפחדים שלך
What are you afraid of? 
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
One-two, one-two, uh
Tell me your fears
Sometimes I see the... Is everything okay?
ספר לי על הפחדים שלך, uh
Tell me your fears
Sometimes I see the world for how fucked up it really is
I tell myself I'll be the one to make a change in it
I could die tonight, not make it to the sunrise
Then I couldn't heal the pain in it
I'm gettin' high to forget about the lows, though
Get a pay check, spend it all on polo
Designer brands cover up my insecurities
Personally I ain't nothin' but an average Joe, though
Now I'm dressin' so expensive for no reason
Cold world we livin' in, it's below freezin'
I got some fam who can't afford a coat
So I leave a little paper there before I go
Spent a thousand on a hotel, they poor and broke
Made me wonder who I'm prayin' to before the show
This a letter to whoever, I'm just tryna set you free
Remember love if you can't remember me
Dear people on Earth after I die
What's the weather like?
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
And I ain't perfect but I try
Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe
Get a second life
This time I'ma get it right
It's either God or the devil with these drugs I'm on
I don't know if we were meant to see it all like this
Still, plantin' seeds so my money long
Money addict, it's a habit that palms gon' itch
I wish we could just all get rich
Sometimes not havin' money is all I miss
And, yeah, these hoes are all up on my dick
The all American girl, that's just a blonde hair bitch
Am I supposed to have some thoughts like this?
Could we figure out what God might've miss?
It's funny that these questions never get an answer
Life a bitch sometimes, you gotta reprimand her
Never understand her, why should I even try?
Live forever then you'll never feel the need to die
This a letter, open it to set you free
Remember love and remember me
Dear people on Earth after I die
What's the weather like?
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
And I ain't perfect but I try
Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe
Get a second life
This time I'ma get it right
What does it mean to be a sensation?
Do you have to be sensational?
And how you know you made it?
When you're with Killa Cam watchin' Paid in Full, I
Never had good grades in school, but
Shock the world is what I came to do, I
Got a song I wanna play for you
So can you sing that back to me? I said
What does it mean to be a sensation?
Do you have to be sensational?
How you know you made it?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, why don't you wake up from your bad dreams?
When's the last time you took a little time for yourself?
There's no reason to be so down
Rather fly around like there's no ground
And I, I bet you wish you hadn't ate
'Cause carrying this weight'll break your glass knees
Yeah, don't need no chauffeur, fuck the backseat
No, I stay behind the wheel and never half-speed
Get the fuck out of my car, this ain't a taxi
They love to see me lonely, hate to see me happy
Call me what you want, she call me "daddy"
Got a knack for gettin' nasty, every day we keepin' tally, yeah
Ooh, it's true I want it badly
Hit the zoom, I be movin' like a athlete
 No reason to be that upset
I'm busy trippin' 'bout some shit that still ain't even happen yet
I keep it honest as honesty gets
Don't know why I'm always talkin' if I'm not makin' sense
I've spent my life livin' with a lot of regrets
You throw me off my high horse, I'd probably fall to my death
 It's obvious you're not on your best
I might just pull your card if it's on top of the deck
Give me, give me what I need and then I'm onto the next
That's what we callin' cause and effect
Yeah, why don't you wake up from your bad dreams?
When's the last time you took a little time for yourself?
There's no reason to be so down
Rather fly around like there's no ground
And I, I bet you wish you hadn't ate
'Cause carrying this weight'll break your glass knees
Yeah, don't need no chauffeur, fuck the backseat
No, I stay behind the wheel and never half-speed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahYeah
Who's that on the other end of the phone?
Didn't hear nothin' when I said my hello
Oh well, to hell then we go
So high, lookin' at heaven below
You know me though from coast to coast for smokin' dope
Overdose with the holy ghost, but hold the phones
I hold my own, was local grown
Been killin' that shit since row the boat
Know I'm supposed to hold the throne, be honest
One more drink, I'ma be an alcoholic
I don't wanna think like better unconscious
Need fresh air, everything so toxic
I open coffin doors with a .38 when it's time for war
Told my mama, "You ain't need no drama
And you ain't gotta cry no more now" 
It'll be alright
My mind on the run, I won't sleep tonight, it's like
When it all goes up in flames, who gon' hold me down? 
And I'm the chosen one
Lookin' all around, what has the world become? Um
The only way to change it is to burn it to the ground 
I've been gettin' paid
About four or five bitches in the Escalade, bet it rain
This money feel the same, I'm afraid that I'ma drown  
You've never been better than me
From this prison, I'm settin' 'em free
Open eyes, I'ma let you see
This world just like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm runnin' to the edge
And when I get there, best believe that I'ma jump, jump
To see if I can fly, fly
I wonder if I jump, jump
Do you think that I can fly, fly?
Yeah
It's the life of a entertainer
I need that check, go and get the waiter
Fuck a troll, this destruction mode
And these explosions don't need detonators
I met my maker in a elevator, he was headed to the top floor
We're quite similar
We just did our work, but we were in it for a lot more
We would try to change the world, but we got bored
When I rip this show, got a encore
Back when we were still in school
We didn't listen to the list of rules
Wrote a million words on the chalkboard
I don't need answers to the questions of intangibles
I told my homies, "The top so lonely
But we ain't gonna die, not now" 
You gon' make it here, live free tonight 'til the day appear
Let's sit back right where we at and let this money pile 
How do we get rich? If she actin' crazy, you don't need that bitch
Wish I knew back then all the things that I know now 
Go on and on, knew I had this shit all along
Take a breath, feel this moment, hold it just so you can 
Look where we at and look where we came from
When will we wake up? Lost in translation
You've never been better than me
From this prison, I'm settin' 'em free
Open eyes, I'ma let you see
This world just like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm runnin' to the edge
And when I get there, best believe that I'ma jump, jump
To see if I can fly, fly
I wonder if I jump, jump
Do you think that I can fly, fly?I gotta take some time to grow
But I don't wanna let you go
How did we get too comfortable?
I gotta take some time to grow
But without you, I’m miserable
I think I got too comfortable
We could take it to the day that I saw you
On your way to the top
Or we could take it to the time that I saw you
Lose your mind and give up
Everybody gets down on luck
Every time you fall I try to pick you up
But I need reciprocation
You got what I need to
Get through the night
But can you be my rock? 
Slippin', can you pull me up? 
I just want to be your girl and not your mom
Is that so wrong?
I gotta take some time to grow
But I don't wanna let you go
How did we get too comfortable?
I gotta take some time to grow
But without you, I’m miserable
I think I got too comfortable
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Look at me watering seeds, it's time to grow
I get out of control when I'm alone
If you can make it with me, you can make it on your own
So quit the bullshit and playing on my phone
We just need some time
Keep watching, let it all unwind
You get yours, of course, I get mine
And in the end, everything will be fine, that's by design
Well, I don't trip, but I slip, I fall
Sleep all day, maybe miss your calls
Like I been missing you
Still, I continue, tied up and tripping up
I'm making the wrong decisions and you sick of it all
But don't leave me, don't leave me
Because it feel too good to be easy 
It’s been a while, and I’m even different now
Shit, I'll probably make it better when you see me
I gotta take some time to grow
But I don’t wanna let you go
How did we get too comfortable?
I gotta take some time to grow
But without you, I'm miserable
I think I got too comfortable
You got what I need to
Get through the night
See, I don't ask for much 
I just want to talk and touch 
I just want to be your girl and not your mom
Is that so wrong?
I gotta take some time to grow
But without you, I'm miserable
I think I got too comfortableYeah, welcome to the dark side of my bizarre mind
I'm trapped inside of this amusement park ride
There's an atom bomb inside my hard drive
I'm holdin' the apocalypse 
Let's take a ride and get lost in this metropolis 
Just realized that I'm an idiot
Wearin' my disguise, my real face is fuckin' hideous
My pretty bitch watchin' Insidious with her pussy out 
Aw, sookie-sookie now 
Rapper terrorist, rarer than good parents is
Puttin' hard drugs inside of all your baby's carriages
Arrogance, throwin' cherry bombs where the sheriff lives 
Just because that shit's hilarious 
And I inherited the thirst for self-destruction and I'm scared of it
I wanna be buried with a novel and a chariot 
I'm a bigger illusion than good marriages 
Or what it means to be American
Whoa
I took acid in San Francisco
Stripped butt-naked, caused a panic at the disco
Fell for the bimbo who was dancin' at the strip show
I gotta stop thinkin' with my dick-hole 
I took acid in San Francisco
Stripped butt-naked, caused a panic at the disco
Fell for the bimbo who was dancin' at the strip show
A genius still thinkin' with his dick bone
Out in Wichita, Kansas, smokin' meth with all the locals 
Askin' them to teach me how to yodel
Suppose I'll die alone from an overdose of some sort
In a motel while some whore I’m fuckin’ runnin' to the drug store
I hacked into the motherboard, argued on a public forum
Uploaded a virus to the network, then unplugged the cord 
The laws are not important
If you scared, lock your door then 
Okay, uh, I always feel like a foreigner
Morphin' into some sort of sorcerer 
I'm Yuri's brother if it's Lord of War
What would I be normal for?
I'm goin' door-to-door shootin' pornos with a good script 
I took acid in San Francisco
Stripped butt-naked, caused a panic at the disco
Fell for the bimbo who was dancin' at the strip show
I gotta stop thinkin' with my dick-hole 
I took acid in San Francisco
Stripped butt-naked, caused a panic at the disco
Fell for the bimbo who was dancin' at the strip show
A genius still thinkin' with his dick boneOnce a day, I rise
Once a day, I fall asleep with you
Once a day, I try but I can't find a single word
I wonder what they know
I wonder if they ever even cared at all
I wonder, do they see their own reflection in the rain
And look away?
Everybody keep rushin'
Why aren't we taking our time?
Every now and again, baby, I get high
Don't ask me what I think
It never really mattered what I had to say
I just keep waiting for another open door
To come up soon
Don't keep it all in your head
The only place that you know nobody ever can see
You're running low on regret
No tears, that's keeping you wet
I think you gettin' it now
But everybody keep rushin'
Why aren't we taking our time?
Every now and again, baby, I get high
And everybody means something
When they're stuck on your mind
But every now and again, why can't we just be fine?
Once a day, I rise
Once a day, I fall asleep with you
Once a day, I try but I can't find a single wordHey, hey, I bet it must be nice, chillin' every day
Not really doin' shit, a couple million in the bank
I'm workin' all the time, never gettin' me a break
But fuck it, that's fine, not a minute go to waste
I just wanna be a legend, every second I gotta be goin' in
A part of me wanna chill, but a part of me wanna win
No college payin' my bills, I'm sayin' just what I feel
'Cause haters be lookin' stupid, when you just keepin' it real
I got too much on my mind, to care about the internet bullshit
Or them people comin' up say I'm forgettin' who I am
Just because they random dudes I went to school with
I'm cool with chillin' with some buddha smoke
I always do it big like a Jewish nose
Cadillacs, I'm tryna get a few of those
Fuck stress, everything'll be okay, like...
How did you know 
I was feelin' so under the weather 
This evenin'?
If you don’t mind 
Come rest your mind 
I think it's all gon' be okay 
And they say they love you , but they kiddin'
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don’t mind 
Come rest your mind 
I think it's all gon' be okay 
Do you believe in fairy-tales, dreams come true?
One day you gon' make it
If they gave you a handout, and you were down bad
Would you take it?
I found that bein' famous in reality, well, it ain't shit
'Cause you could have the world in the palm of your hand
But it don't mean a thing 'til you change it
Listen, baby, I'ma be great now
We can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late
I'ma make my way to the top, every day I get closer
When I was young, they told me to wait until I'm older
They turned a cold shoulder to me
And now they want tickets to my shows for the free
"Hey, Mac, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?"
Bitch, suck my dick
How did you know 
I was feelin' so under the weather 
This evenin'?
If you don’t mind 
Come rest your mind

And they say they love you , but they kiddin'
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don’t mind

Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm ridin' by
I know it sucks with a nine to five
But everything'll be alright
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm ridin' by
I know it sucks with a nine to five
But everything'll be alright
Under the weather, shit'll get better
Under the weather, shit'll get better
The hate ain't gonna last forever, so
I just smile, it's whatever
Under the weather, shit'll get better
Under the weather, shit'll get better
Don't let nobody say you can't
Heart beatin' like a 808
Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm ridin' by
I know it sucks with a nine to five
But everything'll be alright
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm ridin' by

I think—, I think I see where you're goin' with this one, E
Hey, hey
Been around the world and back, yeah, I did that
Still kick raps that cause impact, so where my kids at?
These mu'fuckers hatin', soundin' funnier than Sinbad
I'm ill as the pills that they give you when you collapse
This, that, the other, kiss your mother with that mouth?
We the assholes that she warned you about
We just storm in your house, open doors through a cloud
Got an assortment of style, just be sure that it's wild
6:30 in the mornin' and there still ain't signs of slowin' down
Twin sisters gettin' wasted, so they both are down
It's goin' down, I thought I told you, man
If you tryna party, let me see you raise your hand
There's a party on Fifth Ave. 
Hit me if you tryna go 
I can be there in like twenty, I'ma honk it and come runnin'
'Cause we gotta hit the road 
Make you sure you got a clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes 
Or just hitch a ride there, you choose 
There's a party on Fifth Ave. tonight
And that's what I'm tryin' to do
Hey, what's the difference 'tween me and you?
When no one believe in you, I'm flyer than Beetlejuice
Don't count on the sheep to snooze, I'm fucked up off weed and booze
I party then sleep 'til noon, what every day people do
So haters see me improve, just give me a week or two
See when you read the news, my bitches all sleepin' nude
My rhyme talent is why my album is fly
Your favorite record, you gon' put it aside
This that old school shit, soundin' good in the ride
And fuck ten, I'm only countin' to nine
Said this that old school shit, soundin' good in the ride
So let's head out to the party, I'll drive
There's a party on Fifth Ave. 
Hit me if you tryna go 
I can be there in like twenty, I'ma honk it and come runnin'
'Cause we gotta hit the road 
Make you sure you got a clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes 
Or just hitch a ride there, you choose 
There's a party on Fifth Ave. tonight
And that's what I'm tryin' to do
What's goin' on? There's a party
Hope the neighbors don't mind us gettin' loud
Homies to the left, all the ladies to the right
We came to get down, we gon' do that now
My light up shoes on, my light up shoes on, my light up shoes on
They love the way my kicks flash
This ain't a time to just sit back
'Cause there's a party on Fifth Ave
There's a party on Fifth Ave. 
Hit me if you tryna go 
I can be there in like twenty, I'ma honk it and come runnin'
'Cause we gotta hit the road 
Make you sure you got a clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes 
Or just hitch a ride there, you choose 
There's a party on Fifth Ave. tonight
And that's what I'm tryin' to doJust so Pittsburgh, man
So how's it feel?
Can you tell me how it feel?
Now it's real
So can you tell me how you feel?
Can you tell me how it feel?
Can you tell me how it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?
How it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?
How's it feel? So can you tell me how's it feel?
Can you tell me how it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?
How it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?
Yeah
Said, "Baby, what you doin' tonight?
We could watch the world get ruined tonight," livin' this life
Got you flexin', feelin' colder than ice, let it melt
As we follow all the stupid advice, and I don't usually like 
To be this honest witchu, I must have lost the picture 
Gimme a box of swishers, room full of obnoxious bitches 
Why you lyin' to me? Just grab your ladies
That Mercedes all kinds of roomy, and when the times are gloomy
Hit me up, I can make you feel like that pervert girl you wish you was 
Givin' you that feelin' like when Christmas come 
I just take all of my problems, throw 'em in the blunt
Light 'em up and watch 'em float away, ayy 
Watch 'em float
I can take you anywhere that you wanna go
Can you dream?
Can you tell me how's it feel?
How's it feel? How's it feel?
How's it feel? Can you tell me how
It feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me? 
How it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me? 
How's it feel? How's it feel?
Can you tell me how it feel, how's it feel? 
How's it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?
How's it feel? 
How's it feel?
Okay, said
I'm back on these rap songs  feelin' they're never gonna last long 
Got a shortcut, baby? I'll pass on it, my dick, throw your ass on it 
Pass the time, ask for my alibi, tryna tell you I need that 
Just relax 
Put that money in my motherfuckin' hand 
Take another pull, Goddamn 
Ain't part of the plan, like a car in a van
I'm rollin', I'm feelin' good, I'm golden
My man, let me just do my dance 
'Cause, motherfucker, this my jam, said this my jam, this my jam 
How many times you 'bout to let them opportunities pass you by?
I used to be a pretty passive guy, since before I was a Goddamn mastermind 
In that castle of mine, I came up in half the time as these lame fucks
You can't rush that greatness, that mansion where my maid lives
Like, whoa
Watch 'em float
I can take you anywhere that you wanna go 
Can you dream? 
Can you tell me how's it feel?
How's it feel? How's it feel?
How's it feel? Can you tell me how
It feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me? 
How it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me? 
How's it feel? How's it feel?
Can you tell me how it feel? How's it feel?
How's it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?
How's it feel?
How's it feel? Ha
How's it feel?

How's it feel?
Well, can you tell me how's it feel?
How's it feel? Can you tell me how it feel?
How's it feel? 
How's it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?
How's it feel?
How's it feel? 
"l know, man. Cops can kiss my ass"
"All they are is assholes"
"l know, man, but what's the matter with them? They mad 'cause we get more pussy than they do?"Well
Take your vitamins!
Well, I was on my way to meet up with this woman that I met
The other day while I was on my break to smoke cigarettes
I hit her up, she had some weed and told me, "Come through, we should smoke
Bring a pair of L's, don't bring no money, baby, I ain't broke"
So I'm walkin' up the stairs to the porch
Knocked against the door, heard some feet against the floor
The door had opened up and it was her
She told me, "Hurry, come right in
Leave your shoes up by the furnace, we just put new carpets in"
She asked me 'bout my day, then sat me down
Told me, "We should have some fun, there ain't nobody around"
She got this crazy pill the other day when she was on her way to work
Told me it would make my problems go away and fix the hurt
That I had, well, that don't sound bad
Down the hatch, kinda nervous, "Just relax," she said rubbin' on my back
Well, I ain't really into drugs, but fuck it
I'ma take a trip and I'ma love it 
I don't know what happened to me
But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free
It took me to somewhere off the map
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back, back
I left right after that and started drivin' to my house where I reside
I was high and possibly a little fuckin' out my mind
Can't remember where I live, it ain't like I just bought this house
I said, "Fuck it," took a breath, opened my door and just jumped out
And it's funny 'cause I didn't even hit against the road
I just went right through the ground and started floatin' on my own
I see colors, different colors like they glowin' and they're light
They was glowin' like they glowin' in the dark, but it was bright
That's alright, this shit crazy, what the fuck she had me take?
If this kill me, I'ma come back, haunt her every single day
As I wait, sittin' somewhere that I never seen
Feel like I forever dream, just imagine, set a scene
Power and imagination got all my surroundings changin'
Found a place to drown my brain in somethin' like it's outer space
But nothin' like the pictures from the astronauts
They showed me back at school
When they told me drugs were bad, oh man, oh man, they had me fooled
I don't know what happened to me
But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free
It took me to somewhere off the map
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back, backTime flies, time flies
As we keep livin' and as we keep bein' positive
All we can do is hold onto these memories 
Mac Miller, I love you
All of my homies used to get on my case like, "When you 'bout to kill 'em?"
Soon as I'm out of millions and my girl sprout some children
But I've been murderin' the game, I'm almost out of victims
This food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons
I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though
Shit bro, would you give it all up for these nymphos?
I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?
Half-man and half-amazin', but that's just me bein' modest
I'm an honest man
My mama told me never put it on the lotto and
I work for everything I get, that is my motto, fam
So when I die, these bitches still can fuck my hologram, goddamn
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that...
Watch as time go
Time moves, time flows
How do we handle these things?
I am time, we are time and we have control
One thing we need to remember
Is that we are all in this together
Yeah
You can't expect the unexpected, these dreams I manifested
From my head into reality, they seem a bit excessive, but
I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings
All the times that I've been reckless with a ego big as Texas
Thinkin', "I'm the man"
I never let these hoes inside the plan
My room for bullshit in the crib small as a child's hands
I fill the shoes and walk the path where only giants stand
I am the fire man, shit, I'm way too fly to land, yeah
I'm smokin' weed all alone
On the road, even though I know they need me at home
Keep my control
From a city where it's freezin' and cold
Each to their own
Punches like this prolly beat up Stallone
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride 
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that...
One day, we will
We will find
We will conquer, conquer with love
While time is on our side
Continue to hold to those beautiful memories
They won't be here forever, but our spirit lives on
Lil BI think this is yours
Uh 
That works too
Anyway
Guess who it is, everybody
Y'all is dead weight, less great, always gettin' second place
I tend to race ahead of pace, dippin' while I'm dressed in Bape
Then they chase, catch me if you can, I ain't DiCaprio
This lucid dream will have you go like half a dose of Adderall
Capicola sandwiches are tasty from Primanti's
I'm a 5'7" giant, Brandon Jacobs, Eli Manning
Girls with makeup get demanding, but they fake like orange tanning
So my girl and I be up like we some college students cramming
For a test that we ain't study for, wonder will she love me more
With money, 'cause if not, I'm not sure what all this money for
Feelin' like a hundred wars are goin' on currently
Soldiers sent to death on some jets for the currency
Poison, take this mercury, I'll teach you for a learner's fee
How to turn your girlfriend to a circus freak
Cool by the word of Keith, fabric by the hand of Zeus
Actin' like you fuckin' with me, that's some shit I can't excuse
Focus is on manual, control the panoramic view, universe
You got a chance, don't blow it like how a tuba works
I plan to do somethin' that ain't tangible
Now I'm 'bout to hand it to the homie Mikey  Rocks
Hear what he sayin' to you
Take a trip, took a molly out with Banco Populari 
The word round the city is he sit in a Ferrari 
I told myself I wouldn't get it, I'm sorry
That's my bad, I party 'til my Carties get foggy
Can't keep her hands off of me, got her lock, then lost the key 
Weed smoke make it hard to see, we go harder than Carter one
Excuse me, baby, pardon me, can you fuck me like the honeymoon?
Not sayin' it's comin' soon, but I want the real show 
Get me the treatment that you gettin' all the heels for 
The shit they payin' all the bills for 
Man, I missed it, that cake taste delicious
They can't wait for vacations, paid for by pictures
I'm feelin' good , I'm peelin' bills, I'm real as hell
I don't front , I roll blunts and papers
I don't fuck with fakers, your girl is askin' me if I'ma take her
I'm straight though, you see, I'm booked up 'til April
That's mine, that's me, I take those, you tryna see some pesos
Then shake though, you get exactly what you pay for
Stop actin' like you can't go, you swaggin' to the ankles
I feel you, baby, hopefully I look familiar, maybe
Fallin' down the same rabbit hole lookin' for love
But you will never ever get it, because
It seem like it only happen when I'm holdin' the drugs
And you can never ever see her, because
Life a cliché, it ain't a bad one
First the plane land, and then the bags come
We walkin' on this planet, seekin' action
Break a girl's heart, sorry Ms. Jackson
Fallin' down the same rabbit hole lookin' for love
And you will never ever get it, because
It seem like it only happen when I'm holdin' the drugs
And you can never ever see her
And it don't stop 'til the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gon' rock
This some shit you won't top 
I said it don't stop 'til the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gon' rock
This some shit you won't top 
Uh
Cheah
I'm so high, what you think about that, baby?
On some other shit that tend to make me act crazy
Fifteen thousand, blow it on clothes
Six in the mornin', still sittin' here throwed
I'm buggin' out, buggin' out, I wonder if they know
Pull up to her house and I wonder if she home
Buggin' out, buggin' out, I wonder if they know
Pull up to her house and I wonder if she home
Can I have some?Yeah
I know it's been a minute since I've been away
Didn't mean to cause you pain, I just needed to escape
Ain't sayin' that I'm sober, I'm just in a better place
I'm on my way over, I'm just runnin' kinda late
And you know I've been through all the highs
I've seen all the lows, lost track of time
I'm coming home, you know my mind
Places it goes, and it goes, and it goes
It's only a game
Don't be afraid
These doors will close
And people change
One day you'll go
Right now you're here
Don't leave just yet
Don't disappear
Good morning, babyWhen I was just a kid
Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high 'cause in my lifetime
Man, I've seen some shit
Yeah, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? 
Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun 
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun
In my lifetime, my whole M.O. was to get this M-O-N-E-Y
Sabotage the wealthy and enrichen the poor 
Long story short, that's one of my long-term goals
My anatomy is platinum, gold is old
Lettin' my hair swang like Pootie Tang 
I done seen some spooky things through these Gucci shades
Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums
Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade 
But can't we all just get along? 
Like Martin Lawrence would say and get along with our day
She say, "Soulo, you so crazy and deranged", I say, "I know"
Roll that weed, nigga! 
Most Dope, Top Dawg off the leash
Sounwave on the beat  and our key is anarchy
Your confidence is caca to a kamikaze
Still wishin' peace to all y'all, pardon my nostalgia
When I was just a kid 
Dreamt  that one day we'd all get rich 
No more problems and no more tricks 
I set my sights high 'cause in my lifetime
Man, I've seen some shit 
Yeah, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? 
Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun 
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun
Yeah, I've seen some shit 
How'd I end up in a place like this? 
Swear to God, seen some shit 
Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is
In this lifetime, be the time of your life
It's been a while but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike 
And as a child, I was curious, my mind was the dirtiest 
Curse words was probably my first words  
My home run derby shit , was makin' profit out the park
Even the brightest minds will hang around at dark sometimes
I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize
Had to right my wrongs, the days short, the nights is long
I'm makin' corpses when it's on and eatin' swordfish
From gigantic portions, Lord is important, but I am stronger
I'm a monster with the heart of a lion, divide and conquer
Walk on water, won't be long 'til I'm flyin', that's my departure 
I'm a goner
Shoot you down from the sky with eyes of a archer 
Better find that thing you die for 
 
I'm a problem and as hard as I try, no hidin' from karma
You'd be traumatized seein' what came across these eyes
There was a time...
When I was just a kid
Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high 'cause In my lifetime
Man, I've seen some shit
Yeah, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job?
Take your time
Don't close your eyes
Life happens in a flash
And you don't wanna miss that
Blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun 
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun 
Yeah, I've seen some shit 
How'd I end up in a place like this? 
Swear to God, seen some shit 
Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is
We all grow up to be gangstas , playas , snitches
Freaks and strangers, politicians 
Good and evil people 
Sinners, saints and everything in between
Wicked as Aleister Crowley, know﻿ me
Lately I've been thinkin' 
I've, I've been thinkin'
What's the difference? What's the difference?
Nothing at all! 
Ayy, let me just add one more thing, Josh
*Match being lit*
Ayy, ayy, watch that shit, man, you almost burnt me, nigga!Blue Slide Park
Uh 
Hey, I got these Ray-Ban shades
Kinda look like somethin' Lennon would rock
It seems like now I got a couple bags whenever I shop
Louis shoes, Polo socks, some name brand dumb shit
Logo never make a man, but I'm still blowin' thousands on it
No clue what I'm callin' my album
Fans be at my van screamin', callin' me Malcolm
Never knew the outcome be this much cash now
Bank account lookin' like a George Jung stash house
Young and actin' out, the topics that I rap about
Be varyin' from politics to bitches pullin' asses out
That's exactly how I do this as a rapper
I'm nuttin' in her mouth, you tongue kissin' her after
Daughters' moms kinda want me neutered
But they also want the kid to cum right on they cooter
Have the music soundin' better than guitar tuners
Plus I'm doin' shows daily, call me Jon Stewart
So who you know that's iller than Mac Miller and company?
It's like I planted money seeds right underneath the fuckin' tree
Now I got a hundred G's, so none of y'all can fuck with me
Yeah, I said it publicly, so run and tell your mother, motherfucker
I said run and tell your mother, motherfucker
Hold up, Jerm, let me spit the second
Ayo, I breeze past haters in the E-Class quickly
In deep, did a hundred songs and that’s this week
Shit keeps goin' on and on
We just tryna go bananas like it's Donkey Kong
Yeah, on my grind, always need to work
So I be eatin' good, you be eatin' dirt
If you talkin' shit, you gon' see me smirk
While the DJ be scratchin' 'til the needles burst
A couple screws probably loose in my head
Holler at my girl, tell her bring that doobie to bed
I'm a regular guy with an irregular life
Except I'm a Lamborghini if it's racin' a bike
Who knew that I can turn-turn sound into somethin' so cool?
Fresh kids, see me, I'm bustin' the moves
Comin' in soon to a theater near you
Creep in your kitchen, start eating your food
Girls tryna fuck, I don't be in the mood
No time for pussy when money in the room
Ooh, I switch flows, switch rhythm
Sick spittin', unlimited ammunition, hey
Blue Slide ParkYeah
Yeah, there's no answer and you called twice
Nobody be at my house
I was at the studio all night
Last night I slept on the couch
I might wake up and do it all again
There's a world goin' crazy outside
But let's pretend that it's alright
We keep pretendin' that it's alright
Yeah, alright
Days get mixed up , schedules get switched up 
Can't be two places at once , so
I take a hit of the spliff that I lit up and
Forget I had to be anywhere at all, goddamn
How the mighty will fall , they wanna see me gone
But I'm here in spite of it all , I never play along
You can keep the fear and self-pity 
I'd rather tell you who I am really, yeah
This is not the wake-up call
I am the hotel operator, I don't owe nobody favors
I don't know how the fuck I've been around so long
Busy as a escalator in a crowded mall 
It's like, every year I realize my house too small
Get paid, upgrade, two cribs, new maids, more flights, flew planes
Live out my suitcase , lose days like loose change 
I swear my life is on Blu-ray
Welcome to doomsday, the world needs a hero
And I am your Bruce Wayne, kind of like Luke Cage, well
 You keep on runnin'
We keep on pushin' your buttons
Yeah, there's no answer and you called twice
Nobody be at my house
I was at the studio all night
Last night I slept on the couch
I might wake up and do it all again
There's a world goin' crazy outside
But let's pretend that it's alright
We keep pretendin' that it's alright
I run around with open scissors , they takin' pictures
I could lose my head, it grow instead, gets only bigger
I put one foot in front of the other, I never settle
Waste yo' time with water and wine, I'm turnin' liquid to metals
Still the  same dude that used to never be sure 
When I was way more insecure, did not feel better before, no
Umbrellas never could weather the storm
No sympathy for the devil, too busy buildin' a temple
I am lookin' beyond , leavin' 'em lookin'
Hot as the grill I'm puttin' 'em on when I be cookin'
I keep on runnin' if I have to
Medusa never turned me to a statue, no
I keep it movin' , but keep it low 
You can do your thing, shit, to each their own 
But you better do somethin'
We keep on pushin' your buttons
Yeah, there's no answer and you called twice
Nobody be at my house
I was at the studio all night
Last night I slept on the couch
I might wake up and do it all again
There's a world goin' crazy outside

Who put spiders in my applesauce?
Took the pins out my hand grenade?
Somebody tell me I deserve to die
I looked him in the eye and said the devil not circumcised
So play me a song on the guitar
Got a rainforest in my cigar
There's knots in my yo-yo string
Put a crown on my stallion, I'm the Polo king
I fell in love with a go-go dancer, she a single mom
The underdog, like to play the game with Diddy Kong
She the god type, throw that bitch a Klondike
Everything is alright, see it's written in the Psalms
I told her I get rich off my little songs
Gave her a million reasons that she should come along
Immediately, she dropped her shit
But everywhere I go, they told me, "Watch yo bitch!"
God damn! I guess I got another one
Good vibrations, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch
I put the gourmet flavors inside the honey blunt
Got my head underwater but I ain't comin' up
Fuck air, my bitch's ass is like a plump pear
And she ain't pretty or ugly, I say she just fair
Man, this life is unfair
Okay, I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nuttin' to lose

Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?
Stunting’ in a Uber
Yeah, bitch
Stuntin’ in a Uber
Yeah, bitch
Stuntin’ in a Uber
I'm readin' old Playboy magazines
Somethin' from the '50s when the journalism had its peak
You play the background, you just a member of the faculty
I'm actually out here decision makin'
Had to get my shit together, I was missin' payments
I just pray to God that my lady isn't famous
She threw the gown on and we hit the banquet
She got her own story; just let the bitch explain it
Mac, I think the girl that you speakin' 'bout
Was, in fact, the same chick, late-night, creepin' out
Sneakin' out, my homie knew her, told me keep an eye
Found out she was twerkin', found out she wasn't workin'
The whole game switched when my man hit
Got me rollin' in a circle, top-down, blowin' purple
Seen the parkin' lot, I'm 'bout to crawl up like a turtle 
Seen the parkin' lot, I'm 'bout to crawl up like a turtle
Swang, switchin' lane to lane, still tippin'
Trunk up, top down, call it parkin' lot pimpin' 
Switchin' lane to lane, still tippin'
Trunk up, top down, call it parkin' lot pimpin' 
Okay, I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nuttin' to lose
And I'ma do this 'til I'm a 102
Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?
I said
I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nuttin' to do
And I'ma do this 'til I'm a 102
Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?
Stunting’ in a Uber
Yeah, bitch
Stuntin’ in a Uber
Yeah, bitch
Stuntin’ in a UberYeah, yeah
Let me get a little bit more beat
Yeah
Ask God if she believe in me and will she accept me as a deity
And tell me the secrecy won't keep you free
I'm sleeping, won't dream until the demons leave
I took a nap, beneath a tree in the shade
Feel the sharpness of the swords and blades of grass
Picturin' the images that make you laugh
I left you out to die, but will you take me back? 
Somewhere in between the crazy and the conscious 
She's naked underneath them shadows
Let the sunlight undress her slow
I don't know who I am, I'm so good at doin' impressions though 
I'm goin' to the festival,  need to let me go
I wake up, pop a couple Benadryls, go back to sleep
It's all made up, everything they said was real, it has to be
'Cause actually the master fast asleep
And the castles back-back in his private quarters 
That's a master for you, this a revolution, we don't have no order 
All this torture, thought I had to warn ya 
Leave it all behind and go to California  
I'm past the signs, it's the real thing, try analyzin' this feelin'
Ya can't fathom  
My hands are above the clouds
From the clap-clap thunder lookin' down
While you're runnin' around
I lift you up when you drown
Unlock the mission, the planet in rotation
Full speed chasin' and you're always runnin' ahead
You're always runnin' ahead
You got second chances, happy birthday, sweet romances
And you battle like a champion, why
Do you wanna go, do you wanna go
Do you wanna go to the festival?
You got angels weepin', see them drippin' from the sky
You watch 'em with your third eye 
Do you wanna go, do you wanna go
Do you wanna go to the festival? 
To the festival 
To the festival 
Festival 
Festival 
Hola, Malcolm
Hey, man, it's, it's Luis, man
I'm calling, man, tell you about the album
I listen, it's good
I need to tell you, man
I tell everyone to, to listen to the music
And it sound like they like it, man
It sound like they good. I tell my wife, "I'm so proud of him."
I tell my girlfriend, "I'm so proud of him."
And the album is good
It's so good
I cannot believe
Anyone can be you
No one can beat youYeah
Yeah, all right
Gnillor peek tsuj ,looc s'ti ,dnim reven ,tiaw ,hO
?ni semoc ssab eht erehw ees ,morf em trats uoy nac ,tiaw 
Yeah
Turn the beat up a little bit
Yeah
Um
Yeah
I've been rappin' since the apparition
G-g-g-god was gonna kill me and I'm glad he didn't
Might have made a bad decision
He just left me with an ocean and a bad religion
While Mary Magdalene laughin', smokin' a pack of Winstons
Up on a church hill, acid trippin' with older men
As they tell her stories, she's seducin' 'em
But she only usin' 'em
My studio is filled with spirits
And every single lyric dedicated to my dearest friends
Yeah, and lord knows that we hate the questions
So back and forth, exchange faces over why I'm playin' table tennis at dinner
I end up so bitter when I lose
Defeat hurts, I got scissors in my shoes
And I'm dancin'
Never got the steps right
Loose, I never slept tight
But I'ma keep dancin'
Yeah
Yeah
I did a cannonball off the deep end, my boat was comin' to America
Pouch of fairy dust and a little poodle terrier
A silver Derringer, a smile for the camera 
Split your line up like James Farrior
I've always been a cowboy, they need me like the cancer cure
Weed loud as crowd noise, we just let the amber burn
Wiffle Balls, child's toys, ain't fuckin' with amateurs
I'm Ken Griffey on the Mariners
Okay, I'm way beyond the boundaries, outside of parameters
The rap chancellor, jacket made of camel fur
And Clockwork got every single answer 'cept time
I've experienced every feelin' except fine
I'm line dancin' againHey, ten thousand dollar hands, million dollar plan
My fam's still the only people that really know me for who I am
Damn, got me askin' when I got this fly
The type to change because of fame, I'm just not that guy
Still sippin' on my 40 when the cops drove by
When I go, gotta tell my girl to stop, don't cry
See, I-I-I been buyin' these diamonds
All designer clothes and a Benz just to drive in
Autograph signin' must've got to my head
Fuck that, I've been the same lil' mu'fucka
Always down to share my shit, melody with snare kick
So I don't give a fuck about some lames I rode the ferry with
My larynx is imperative to live, music's what I need, boy
Destroy all of these fake me's, they decoys
Everywhere I go, these companies give me free toys
These random strangers just treatin' me like we boys
Ayo, Pennsylvania nights , 9:30 flights 
Thinking to myself, where does all this go? 
No time to care , got more I can share 
By now, this life is all I know
So this is all I know , this is all I know 
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight 
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit 
So make a toast to a good life 
Hey, hey, ten thousand dollar hands, billion dollar plan
Listenin' to jams while I'm sittin' in my van
This is who I am, wrote these lyrics on my DNA code
Happy as hell, MDMA, yo
Fuck a job, there ain't no one that I call my boss
We just tryna work so we can blow up like a Molotov
And it kinda wake me up like a coffee shop
Thinkin' 'bout my people who was murdered in the Holocaust
Got me thankful just for life by itself
And there's way more people here I should be tryna help
Am I wrong for spendin' money how I do? 
It's just funny old people see the logo on my chest
You got ya thumb held high? We can be friends
Other people pretend we hang out on the weekends
These fuckers lil' bit creepy, so we just leave them
Say, "Get some rest," when I die, I'ma sleep in
Ayo, Pennsylvania nights , 9:30 flights 
Thinking to myself, where does all this go? 
No time to care , got more I can share 
By now, this life is all I know
So this is all I know , this is all I know 
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight 
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit 
So make a toast to a good life 
Pennsylvania nights , 9:30 flights 
Thinking to myself, where does all this go? 
No time to care , got more I can share 
By now, this life is all I know
So this is all I know , this is all I know 
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight 
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit 
So make a toast to a good life Sunshine or rain , I'll be there 
For the good times or bad, I'll be there 
Sunshine or rain , I'll be there 
For the good times or bad , I'll be there
Hey, hey
See, I was six years old with a dream
When my moms told me I could do anything
Said she'd be there forever, no matter what's the weather
She'd always have my back even when we weren't together
And I took her for granted, thought I had a plan
This a different generation, I don't think you'd understand
In the quest to be a man, you start to learn you need your family
It wasn't for them, I'd be way closer to insanity
It ain't about the vanity, think about what's important
The reason I was six years old rockin' some Jordans
The reason I had food, my own damn room
A TV in the livin' room to watch my cartoons
I just hope she know I love her, the world's best mother
Yeah, it ain't fair, so I'ma take care of her in her gray hair
When I get rich, I'll have her livin' like she should be
No stress, no worries, you can call me 'cause it's...
Sunshine or rain , I'll be there 
For the good times or bad , I'll be there 
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there 
For the good times or bad , I'll be there
Hey, hey, hey
Dear momma, please don't start to cry
You the reason I'm alive, how these years have gone by
You were there when I was on my first bike ride
Ridin' in the street and that delivery truck almost ran right over me
You were at my games when I was sittin' on the bench
And when I skipped school, you lie and say that I was home sick
Had my back before I had my own
I know I'm always welcome when I'm back at home
I just want to bring you out on stage to get a standin' ovation
All the work you did to make my life feel like a vacation
If you have your moms, you better treat her right
Call her up, say "Wassup?" before you sleep tonight
Tell her you love her and thank her for what she did
You may be grown now, but remember bein' a kid
When she fed you in a bib, shit, you were her baby
So find out what she doin' lately
Uh, I wanna tell you, momma…
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
For the good times or bad, I'll be there 
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
For the good times or bad, I'll be there
Hey, hey, haha
Hey, hey
Some shit ya just gotta say
Mm-hmm, like
Uh-huhUh, bitches stay hatin', this is Claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid
Bitches stay hatin', this is Claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid
Picture
Fresh off a steroid swisher
Pistol at the peephole, that's a paranoid nigga
One of a kind though, ain't nobody close to me
Your ass is straight over D, I'll bag it like groceries
It's whatever though, whatever cross my mind
Haters got no watch, I ain't got the time
Vinny got more flow than a box of wine
Rare as a copper dime, I got an awkward mind
But it's beautiful, like Russel Crowe
Fire at the fingertips, can't extinguish it
Shorty gave me tight head without shrinking it
Coolest kid out, on my Chuck Inglish shit
Mac and Vinny always get the people loose
Fall back, strike back, just like evil do
The birds prey on us like eagles do
It's like claymation the way they bend and move
Uh, bitches stay hatin', this is Claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid
Bitches stay hatin', this is Claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though? 
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid 
Picture
Monster and Michael Keaton, and I'm offing you while you sleep
And you talking but it's so cheap, and I'm popular for a reason
I got a pool but it's sharks swimming in the deep end
Don't get much sleep, two minutes and get a dream in
Is all you need, it's crazy
The colony was lost at sea getting wavy
The rawest rapper, baby forehead autographer
On top of Saturn, I'm sending shots from a rocket blaster
Believe me this is where geniuses live
It's Most Dope, we holier than all of Jesus' kids
But we speaking to heathens and all of these Even Stevens
Who don't need a reason, just want a bitch they can feed with semen
No need for sleeping, Cheeba gon' keep me dreaming, I'm faded
Been in Cali a lil' too long, it got me jaded
Hit Japan and I'm Instagrammin' camera shy Samurais
Fucking up a Jerm beat, teach you how to vandalize
The bandana Santana tied
The sound amplified screams on Kennywood's Steel Phantom ride
My pockets fat, I'm still looking for some pants my size
They over-analyze everything I fantasize
We could have a conversation, we could pantomime
Girl you could come a little closer, put your hand in mine
This life a prison, it's time to set you free
Watching movies in silence describing what I see
Uh, bitches stay hatin', this is Claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid
Bitches stay hatin', this is Claymation
Fucked up, get away, that's a vacation
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though? 
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid 
PictureUh, look
Good evening
Yeah
When I party in New York, take the late night subway
Goin' out Friday to comin' home Monday
From all directions never find me on the one way flavor
The rhyme just the icin' on the cupcake fuck face
My fans notice these other rappers is bogus
I'm supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
And the boy stay, kickin' incredibly dope shit
Make my mama proud 'cause my clothes fit
Travel round the globe bitch, on my Lewis Clark shit
Don't matter where I live, 'cause I can tell you where my heart is
I just stay on my side, fuck where everybody at
Tell the planet, "Peace", 'cause I'm gone I ain't comin' back
Had the whole regular life I can tell you that I'm done with that
Try to build a mil' off a couple stacks
Own my own business, investin' all I got into these fuckin' raps
Willie Parker money, hand it off then it's runnin' back
Ayo you fuck wit' dat
Uh you gotta fuck wit' dat
You in love wit' dat
Look, uh, Mac Miller
Takin' sips from the fountain of youth
If you ain't heard about the kid then you out of the loop
As I'm sittin' back starin' at this world in my eyes
See out the window in my room that I’m hidden inside
I'm just a kid who stays speakin' his thoughts, talkin' his mind
Life a roller coaster but I stay along for the ride
Put my heart up on the page, and the song gonna cry
There’s logic behind the way stayin' caught in a lie, boy
Ain't a shock that I'm a topic of discussion
Muhfuckers want my spot so they probably wish I wasn't
They give a little love like everyone does
In reality, they stoned off that competitive drug
And I don't blame 'em, 'cause those who above me, I'm gunnin' for
Try and make my way to the top, startin' from the floor
And I don't even need to bring a single gun to war
'Cause I be on some shit that they ain't never done before
Takin' over piece by piece, startin' from the core
It's only been a year, I can stick around a hundred more
Said I could stick around a hundred more
I ain't goin' nowhere
Young and so much time to go
Jerm, you might as well keep this one rollin'
I got like one more verse I haven't spit three verses on a song in a minute
See if I can remember this one
Aight look
You can find me in the lab workin' overtime
Smell the weed when you going by, global grind
And I ain't just a local guy
When you feelin' stressed out, have an L
Blow money, keep my lady decked out in Chanel
Live fast when I die better wish me well
Huh, I just hope they servin' beer in hell
Just an everyday story that I'm here to tell
So please, stick around for the epilogue
For anyone who ever blog, probably heard my name
Hip-Hop's underdog, you wanna win the game
I'm sick of hearin' how music change never be the same
And these dudes who think they everything and never pick a lane
Call yourself a vet, but haven't won a single game
Mad, every girl got my name imprinted in her brain
Boy, I'm a beast, match the style in bars
Find me smokin' weed where the wild things are
Yessir
So I mean, I had to take this time
Real quickly, to just go in
I don't know man I feel like you should never stop goin' in on your shit
That's just me
I mean, Q and Treej out there we excited just makin' history
And Jerm of courseI've been a God way before a synagogue
Liquor drops used to hit the spot like a cinderblock
This is not what you wanted, but this is what you got
You live with what you got
Elixir that I'm mixin' like I'm in the kitchen whippin' rock
I'm in the spot like the middle of a prison box
And you ain't nothin' to the planet but a little dot
Suddenly hit the water like the line that's on a fishin' rod
Simple thoughts got me itchin' like the chicken pox
Knitted socks, with fingers tryna scratch a lotto ticket off
When I made it, I was gettin' all the bitches off
See, I was faded, now I'm countin' up the minutes lost
I throw 'em back like opponents hit a homer
My mind, it holds explosion like a pose that's on a poster
I'm out the holster with it
I overdid it like the way the roller coaster spinnin'
Homie, that's inertia
I'm the moon to the sun, how I birth ya
Turn ya, back to ya old ways, reverse ya
Curse ya, witchcraft
You get nothin' but a whole lot of nothin'
With your mothafuckin' bitch ass
You simple as a whistle, never pick a side
Shit, you always in the middle, never down to ride
I was high like I'm born to fly
Never die, I'm immortalized, here before ya eyes
Lord of the flyest, I is your highness
And no diamond when the shine ultraviolet
You on your bullshit, I'm on assignment
And I be on it like a stylus on a PalmPilot
I'm God's finest work, this way beyond timeless
Copped the new presidential Rollie, keep the watch silent
'Cause everybody tickin' me off
I got the world with her legs open, lickin' the box, shit
She home wet, sweatin' me for phone sex
Don't stress, daddy'll be home soon
And assume I'm down low with the post moves
I come through and hit the hole like Jones-Drew, yeah
My old chick is old news
But add fuel to fire, what I won't do
So, I just kick it with the homies like I'm supposed to
And we go back like gold hoops
Well, this the cold feelin', bone chillin', borderline dope dealin'
I'm goin' up with no ceilin', shit
Out of body, got my soul swimmin'
And no different, good head keep my toes twitchin'
You know Larry been fishin' since he in the womb
This the scoop up the Big Dipper, you the little spoon
Went from invisible and minuscule
To invincible, dancin' with the Benes moves
I made a million and it killed me
My second million got me mothafuckin' filthy
You ain't nothin' 'til you die and come back to life iller
They haven't made a mo'fucker realer, Mr. Miller, yeahEverybody wanna ask where I came from
Young kid who bang drums, money, don't you worry, I'ma make some
Somebody changin' the world, it only takes one
Never scared of death, but I ain't ready for that day to come
A million people in the world, I don't hate one
Even them dummies robbin' people with some fake guns
Make mistakes, young boy, that's just what I heard
And you don't ever figure out what you don't wonder first
I got another verse, invincible and nothin' hurts
A hundred words, comin' up with what'll have your bubble burst
We can just fuck, you don't need to take my number first
Gettin' right to it, I ain't really tryna cuddle first
I used to try everything with her, but nothin' worked
Got her backwards like she heard the thunder first
These are the days of our lives, and I ain't lyin' kid
Bein' free, tell me what kind of crime that is
It said it can't let me spit a couple sentences
Always good penmanship, make sure you all remember this
You just entered into Blue Slide Park
The place where dreams comin' true, that's where you find heart
Up until the sun come up, yeah, my crew grind hard
See me out throughout the day, but you won't find me in the dark
Say I'm smart with remarks, such remarkable bars
Who knew this music would get me a couple cars
That just sit in park 'cause I'm out somewhere travelin'?
Mackin' on the preschool honeys, you were somewhere tattlin'
Mac has been known to always spaz again
Every single track with him, "Oh, he's just so talented"
Dream of countin' money 'til my fingers get some calluses
King with many palaces, a fuckin' golden fork to eat my salad with
I observe, askin' what did he design
I see an artificial future for a digital mind
Muhammad Ali, yeah, I'm him in his prime
Just that normal kid in class you was sittin' behind
Didn't really pay attention to him spittin' his rhymes
But now you see his car, try gettin' inside
No, hell no
Haha, I wanna go back home
Keep it, hold up 
Late night, can't remember what the day's like
Reminiscin' on stop signs and brake lights
'Cause it seems that I'm always on the move 
When they gonna let me back home?
Yeah
I wanna go back home
I wanna go back homeI made this beat
Uh
Yeah
Oh, and I—and then I wrote to it too
So it go like this
It’s like real late and Jerm’s tryna get home
So I’ma try and one take a ma'fuckin' song
Uh, uh, uh
When you first start rappin' everybody curious
Then you make it happen and everybody furious
Young kid courteous, don’t know what the worry is
Wanna be buried in my Pittsburgh jersey, bitch
Nobody certain if you gonna make it
Life give you some hurt and then you gonna hate it
Sometimes it leave you cold and it leave you naked
But one thing for certain I’ma leave it faded
Still young but I wonder when my time gon' be up
When my time come I’ma smile and peace up
Shorty sipping forties, hangin' out by the tree stump
So Jerm and me started making hits and it occurred to me
You didn't have to be like thirty-three to start earning cheese
With uncertainty, in it for eternity
A lot of style, little money and some purple weed
Me and my queen, my girl, not Freddy Mercury
‘Cause first you work for free, anything to get noticed
Stayin' focused ’cause bullshittin' was hopeless
So treat yourself like a damn professional
Your first music check, damn incredible
Every day feel like the best day ever
Until every day feel like the best day ever
And you used to them days, kinda become a routine
You have a bad one, fuck up a good dream
You realize that you’ll probably be away when
All the people die and you never get to say
Everything you always wanted to but never got the chance to
Start to weigh you down, what can a man do?
I could’ve stayed around, probably cancelled
A couple of shows, spent the last two
Years being dumb on the road, I guess
Haven’t got to spend too much in the home
Time is what you make it, but player don’t be mistaken
All of your shit get taken
Broken, beaten oasis, still I wouldn’t trade it
Now it's five o’clock, but my mind won’t stop
I’ve been thinkin' ’bout life, pourin' syrup and pop
Smokin' cigarettes like I’m really tryna die
Try to keep my head on my shoulders but my mind in the sky
I’m that moment when a gazelle and a lion collide
I'm a burned down building with a diamond inside
Yup, independent platinum, wishing well passing
Jewel'ry out the ice age, bitch outta Maxim
I be writin' this shit and just relaxin’
Let the time start passin'
Yeah, so I just made this ma'fuckin' beat
And decided I was gonna rap on it too
It’s late
Yup
Took my chains off to rap this song
Ou, almost dropped my big chain *laughs*
Uh, who'd ever thought that I’d be standing in a booth with a big chain?
Sike, I’m joking, I don’t got another verse
All right, peaceMaybe I can get a little more high
 Come and talk shit, who the boss, bitch?
Moon the crowd now, Randy Moss shit
Sharks swimmin' in the water you'll get tossed in
And fuck a first class, I'm in the cockpit
It's obnoxious, it's bumpin' out my car
Bass'll shake your dinin' room table from afar
Down the street, they can hear me pretty clearly
Makin' in a night what your daddy pull in yearly
See a little style, I got mine's patent
Always rock a smile, never a distraction
Brand new Mercedes, cameras when I back in
Fuck with Single Ladies, yeah, I did a little actin'
Love me on the weekend but hate me when I'm workin'
Overly dedicated and overly medicated, for certain
Buy her a brand new purse and it's gravy
I ain't talkin' Slim when I say these bitches Shady
Chicken sandwiches and turquoise beads 
Tattoo sleeve, pair of Levi's jeans 
Never get no sleep , you know all about me
Come and meet my team, bitch 
Meet my team, meet my team 
You know all about me, come and meet my team 
Bitch, meet my team, you know all about me 
Come and meet my team 
And if you see me, I'll be with my team 
Got my homie Billy, probably in Supreme 
Jimmy or Will be sellin' shirts to the fans
While TreeJay, Clock, they got you raisin' your hands 
Then you got Q, that's my right-hand man
Shout out Little Dave, sittin' shotty in the van 
Everyone I came with, travel like a gang, bitch
City after city, everybody speak our language
We just flex , get bootlegs checks 
Got all these people askin', "What's next?" 
Success and a dumb fresh life
Takin' bets, you tryin' to lose a little money tonight?
I'm on top of the stage but under the lights
We invadin' your crib and fuckin' your wife
So have a ball, no sports, no Spaldin'
Poppin' champagne, gon' spray it on her awning
Chicken sandwiches and turquoise beads 
Tattoo sleeve, pair of Levi's jeans 
Never get no sleep , you know all about me
Come and meet my team, bitch 
Meet my team, meet my team 
You know all about me, come and meet my team 
Bitch, meet my team, you know all about me 
Come and meet my team 
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
What happened to that shit you was talkin' before?
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
What happened to that shit you was talkin' before?
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
What happened to that shit you was talkin' before?
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
Goes: one, two, three, fourI've hung around with the best out
Smile with my chest out
Shit, I've been stressed out, they thinkin' I'm depressed now
I just wanna go and chill at Kanye West's guest house
Bitch pull her breasts out, I forget about my ex now
Feelin' fresh out, chillin' in a penthouse
Been here for so long 'bout to start payin' rent now
She used to cook me breakfast 'til I turned her to a pen pal
I'm at the grocery store, lost in the eggs aisle
10 point takedown, Alabama shakedown
Used to rapid eye movement, beautifully awake now
Think I ain't a superhero, need to check my cape out
Dripped up and draped out
It's all good, you safe now
Be safe, homie
In this life or the next life, I'ma see ya
So, be safe, homie, be safe, homie
In this life or the next life, I'ma see ya
Yeah
And everything will be cooler
Maneuver away from evildoers
If Gene Hackman is captain, no one can beat the Hoosiers
See the future, no crystal ball that I'm starin' at
Ancient Egypt pharaoh rap starrin' Jack Kerouac
A half-a-ton of cattle dung, this shit I sadly have become
Ashin' blunts 'til I'm left with only half a lung 
Yeah, I'm here, self-claimed deity
Cryin' durin' the Lion King, that's just the G in me
Highly offensive, been on both sides of the fences
Hence the confusion when I stare at my reflection
Man's duality, life and its formalities
We're born as potential, then leave as a casualty
I'm in the lab, suited up, performing alchemy
Meditating 'til I'm levitating out my seat
It all started with a PayPal
Dripped up, draped out
It's all good, you safe now
Be safe, homie
In this life or the next life, I'ma see ya
So, be safe, homie, be safe, homie
In this life or the next life, I'ma see yaYeah, you know I love havin' a studio at home
Because right when I walk in the booth
You know I, I take a sip of my drink
You know like, light a cigarette and walk up to the mic
And it's exactly the correct height for me
That really just makes me feel comfortable
You know, lets the mind be at ease
And I, I noticed that, that uh, sometimes I, I rap with my rollie on
And sometimes I take it off
You ain't gotta worry if you're cold
Promise, baby, I'll be there by tomorrow
From the beginnin', I'll be down for it all
'Cause I ain't seen nobody like you, and
You look so good, when you walk by
I had to stop, you blew my high
A real angel, bring it back to Earth
Hi, I'm sitting in the clouds
Everything around seems different to me now
And this could be a change for the both of us
Get away from the world that's controllin' us
It's only just me, I hope you trust me
You look a little nervous, keep adjusting
Your blouse that you got on
The buttons come undone
Let me know if you need me to put a fan on
I stand on the floor, 'bout to collapse
The bliss turns to war, heart turns to ash
Fun turns to drugs, the idea of cash
Has taken away my mind
And I think that it's a sign that
Your beauty handed me my mind back
My conscious will attempt to dissolve
I do some shit I won’t remember at all
You ain't gotta worry if you're cold
Promise, baby, I'll be there by tomorrow
From the beginnin', I'll be down for it all
'Cause I ain't seen nobody like you, and
You look so good, when you walk by
I had to stop, you blew my high
A real angel, bring it back to Earth
Ayy, what's up, A? Check in
Ayy, my eyes open  but I'm barely awake 
They say my codeine purple  and your beauty is ayy 
That beauty takin' me away  I'm smokin' on that good Cali
I'm gettin' higher than Hollywood, get deeper than the valley
As you get lower than lowrider, your favorite ghost writer 
We jumpin' the gun  I might go over beyond
Purchase a one-way ticket, don't know when you'll return 
I need to roll me a blunt, 'cause you done blew this joint 
They say the stars all line up  then they bring out the sun 
Hey, this a red carpet event  I'ma bring out that one
She so sophisticated, I brought her presidential rollies
I'm no longer faded , she got me sober off of conversation 
I'm no longer faded , she got me sober off of conversation 
You ain't gotta worry if you're cold
Promise, baby, I'll be there by tomorrow
From the beginnin', I'll be down for it all
'Cause I ain't seen nobody like you, and
You look so good, when you walk by
I had to stop, you blew my high
A real angel, bring it back to EarthAyy
Turn my beat up a little bit, yeah
For real, I was—, I was—
Oh, it's gonna get louder?
A'ight, cool
She keep on gettin' played like it's recess, break her heart's a reflex
She wanna hit the beach and show her titties down in Key West
Someone leave her cryin' all the time and now she finally outta Kleenex
Sick of dudes not givin' her the respect
'Cause really she a genius, a CEO
Tryin' to be on top alone, she don't keep them close
She been waitin' for the opportunity to be a boss
Tough bitch, probably would've thought she played lacrosse
Sick of bein' soft with her heart broken all the time
Want some money too, fuckin' dudes
And fallin' all in love with who, was nothin' new
Only comin' through to bust a nut or two
She just need her family like the Huxtables
And now she on the road, left them home to takeover
Get rich and have her crib made over
But she gon' do it partyin', with her cup full
Ain't gon' trust you, but she gon' fuck you, haha
She wants diamonds, she wants gold
But she's scared to let you get too close
'Cause she's been high and she been low
But now she finally on her own
And they’ve been lookin', so they been findin'
'Cause she ain't runnin', she ain't hidin'
Until she find her way back home
And then she's finally all alone
She gon' be rich, as fuck
In high school, they were callin' her a slut
But now she comin' up, Louis Vuitton, and Juicy on her butt
See the bitches that be hatin' like, "What’s up?"
'Cause they ain't doin' nothin', and she out here stuntin'
Middle finger to them hoes, all them bitches had it comin', haha
Yeah, on top of the world, she lookin' down
Invite you to the crib, let you look around
Just a fuckin' tease, tryna get your cheese
Invite you out to dinner, 'cause she wanna eat for free
She could pay it if she wanted to, she won't though
Go home, she got more dough, haha
She wants diamonds, she wants gold
But she's scared to let you get too close
'Cause she's been high and she been low
But now she finally on her own
And they've been lookin', so they been findin'
'Cause she ain't runnin', she ain't hidin'
Until she find her way back home
And then she's finally all alone
She wants diamonds, she wants gold
But she's scared to let you get too close
'Cause she's been high and she been low
But now she finally on her own
And they've been lookin', so they been findin'
'Cause she ain't runnin', she ain't hidin'
Until she find her way back home
And then she's finally all aloneCheck it out
Uh-ah-ah, top of the morning to you
You know, it's been so dark outside
That I—that I figured I'd turn a couple motherfuckin' lights on real quick
Uh
I ain't talkin 'bout nothin' with a flow so disgutin'
Ashtray by me that I gotta dump my guts in
Need substance, feed it to the public
No one gon' touch it like my Poppy's old musket
Roll up to the function, eatin' all the Funyuns
Sentence keep runnin', word to double E Cummings
When people say to me it doesn't mean nothin'
Bumblebees buzzin' 'cause the trouble needs lovin'
Wonder who really give a fuck what I have to say?
Those are the people to which I dedicate this rap today
Your shit is fragile, if I have to I'ma crack your face
Monday to Saturday, I'm actin' like a basket case
While Sunday I'm goin' golfin' with my Callaway's
Or watchin' football, word to Joey Galloway
Take a shower, start singin' like Al Green
From outside, it probably sound like some loud screams
Always had child dreams and nightmares
My music like the airport, I hop on a flight there
Wanna go to Monaco to see what it's like there
Roll up in a pair of Nike Airs, just like, "Yeah
Wassup?" Here I am, lookin' in the mirror and
All I see is me, I'm at peace
Go rent out a penthouse, forget all my problems
The things I regret now, be gone by the mornin'
My life is startin', I'm ready as I ever been
Pencilin' my schedule that I gotta move on from mistakes
Number One albums, always givin' you mixtapes
And that's what I'ma do until I'm richer than Bill Gates
It ain't all about money for me, though
I do this for the people who need a boost in their ego
Work a lot, I'm an addict not a fiend, though
Get up, get out, and get somethin', word to Cee Lo
Bottles of Clicquot, a couple of Cristal
May head to L.A. like I'm Chris Paul
'Bout to go platinum off of "Missed Calls"
So all of y'all can lick balls, ha ha
Yeah
Just, you know
Run from the dark
And into the light
You know, you know
You're gonna find your way out
Run from the dark
And into the light
Oh-woah, you know
You're gonna find your way
Just run to the sunlight
Just run to the sunlight
Just run to the sunlight
Just run to the sunlightI never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
'Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
'Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney, boy, my family Proud
Make 'em say, "Ow," make 'em say, "Oh"
The hoes that tell me "Yes," the same ones that tell ya "No"
Whoa, I ain't just an Average Joe, way above the average flow
Boy, my life is Most Dope, uh
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughin' like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek, ayy, ayy
And I ain't gonna wait for nothin'
'Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This gon' be the best day ever
If it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half-insane, and with the lames I see you hatin'
But there's nothin' that you changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin', I'll be in another zone
Move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Find a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Thumbs up, homie, I'll be sure
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughin' like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek, ayy, ayy
And I ain't gonna wait for nothin'
'Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This gon' be the best day everYeah
It's the realness
City of the steel, where the films is
Bill shit, ballin' like a smaller Josh Childress
I'm in the buildin', swagger on a million
Ill shit, in my bitch pussy like a drill-bit
MILFs get hunted down, pussy age like fine wine
Busy ol' clock in the dark, hard to find time
Spittin' out iodine, rhymin' on advance
Finna burn ya, put the magnifyin' glass to all you ants
It's fire everywhere we go
Nobody watch you anymore, like Drew Carey shows
Comin' through your stereo, here to cause the chaos
Bitches throwin' bras on stage, hit 'em with paintballs, shit
"How'd you make out?"
Pretty good, got a mansion and a lakehouse
Millions off of PayPal, in the table at the steakhouse
Man, life is brilliant, militant, still the shit, killin' off civilians
All these white rappers, I'ma never meet my children
That don't go for everybody, just the obvious ones
I'm on the boat, 'bout to eat when this tilapia come
I put the cocaine away, I'm drinkin' coffee a bunch
So what you in it for? Pretty sure it's more than a hunch
Wrote the formula for defeat in the form of orderin' such
A warrior, I'm too much
Watchin' porn on a camcorder while I'm orderin' lunch
I give you more than enough, what?
The young heavyweight, rappin' on detonate
Reading Hemingway, I been a leader, not a lemming, better get it straight
Fuck the system, bitch, it's time for prison break
I been a great, shake it, got you fallin' just for timber's sake
And I ain't Justin Timberlake, but I ain't much intimidatin'
Waitin' patiently, like can't you see? This shit is innovation
Been creatin', standin' on the roof, I feel the shingles breakin'
I'm just spittin' raps and y'all be single-makin'
Unlock ankle bracelet, paper chasin', in the pussy, procreation
Grand slam, load the bases, in the zone, bring 'em home
Been around the globe, done a hundred thousand shows
Now I'm in album mode, everything I touch, it turn to valuable
Pittsburgh, pile of snow
Never gave a fuck about a slut, I pile-drive a ho
Wild lion, tiger flow
Expert rhymer, never will I tire with these firestones
You might as well retire, go and find a homeYeah
Uh, eatin' shawarma, doin' drawings of Chewbacca
Bumpin' Flocka, fuck the drama
Marijuana been as calmin' as the fuckin' Dalai Lama
Your style common as a little league sponsor from retarded kid's fathers
I'm at meetings, shakin' hands and addin' commas to my net worth
Talk about my money please, and feelings might just get hurt
This the same effect and less words
Chillin' with this asshole, he call himself Sweatshirt
I think this might be some of my best work
I let these bitches dive in, but it's head first
Applyin' pressure when I put together letters
I'm a king, I'm a myth, beat a bitch down with my scepter
These Fendi treasures feelin' better than a million sweaters in Alaska
Your raps are corny as Nebraska
Lacksa-daisical bars, my throwaways will trash ya
High as NASA on acetone
Acid foam, talkin' trash like John McEnroe
You a little bitch, it's what the fuckin' cabbage patch is fo'
Watch me smack a ho
Turn around and catapult up above my castle's moat
Right into my fuckin' throne
Yo, this man is dapper, manufactured in hell
You candy rappers goddamn disasters, myself, I'm chillin'
Clubhouse, I'm demandin' passwords so villains can't infiltrate
This type of lifestyle that one simulates
My bitch is great, had a dinner date with William Gates
He took her to his big estate, the bitch flipped the safe
Slid, escaped through the kitchen, bang, dipped it down the interstate
Handed me the money, started suckin' me off
This a full-blown virus, we don't fuck with a cough
Made money off the white without touchin' the soft, I'm in there
Million dollars, I been there, 'bout a few times
Mulan, she on the futon, tryna do lines
This coupe, I'm in, highway about a buck fifty
Middle finger out the window, who wanna fuck with me?
I told Dom's and Hodgy, "Stop poppin' molly"
Tryna blow up and die: some real kamikazes
Young fisherman sinkin' in Lake Michigan
Innocence, voice of an angel, some Minnie Riperton
Exquisite bitch, gettin' lit, live from the Wimbledon
Still sinnin', this ill pimpin' is Bill Clinton
She butt-naked swimmin', I'm payin' her no attention
Workaholic, got a TV show
I know you seen the crib, nasty since a youngin' mind
Sanitary birth, watch a beat get buried in a hurst
Yeah, I kill myself
Mac hippie analog, you rap midi, turn the camera's off
I made you snap and slap your bandana off
Your bitch greet me like I'm Santa Clause, mouth wide
I'm high as a satellite, see
I'm in ancient Greece, gettin' head from Aphrodite
Mac is mighty, got a bunch of whitey's actin' like me
I set the bar high
This a bizarre ride, word to Pharcyde
In plaid pants, hit a hole-in-one on the par-five
Eyes closed, drinkin' whiskey, let the car drive
These hoes thirsty, see the dick and they large-eyed
The rawest rapper, baby forehead autographer
On top of Saturn, I'm sendin' shots from a rocket blaster
Believe me, this is where geniuses live
It's Most Dope, be holier than all of Jesus's kids
But we speakin' to heathens and all of these Even Stevens who don't need a reason
Just want a bitch they can feed with semen
No need for sleepin', cheeba gon' keep me dreamin', I'm faded
Been in Cali a little too long, it got me jaded
Hit Japan and I'm Instagramin' camera shy samurais
Fuckin' up a Jerm beat, teach you how to vandalize
The bandana Santana tied
My sound amplified
Screams on Kennywood's Steel Phantom rides
My pockets fat, still lookin' for some pants my size
They over-analyze everything I fantasize
We could have a conversation, we could pantomime
Or you could come a little closer, put your hand in mine
This life a prison, time to set you free
Watchin' movies in silence, describin' what I see
WordWhoop!
Had to throw one of those in there, uh
This that, motherfuckin' millionaire music, ya feel me?
Chyah

Better get it before it's gone 'cause my shop been open long 
I stay smokin' on that strong , I'm smokin' on that strong 
Then go and take a handful of drugs, what the fuck is goin' on? 
Bein' rich? Well, that's fun as hell
These bitches come like they under spells
Yo, Mr. Jobs, you see I'm a Mac
But I'm rollin' deep like Adele 
I'm Robert Downey Jr., you more like Steve Carell 
So get smart, no head starts, put a lion on a gazelle
You tryna rhyme 'cause you idolize what I design for myself 
But it's hard to find these bars of mine so Columbine yourself 
I don't hate ya bitch, just fakin' rich
I get paper like grades at Cambridge
I'm best friends with my banker, shit
Gave fifty racks just to make a wish
Brand new crib, I'm paintin' it
Half a mil, just paid for it
No Thanksgiving Parade in this
But we marchin' like the Saint's came in
So run and hide, eyes open wide 'cause this gon' be your jam 
Just burn a Dutch, then turn it up as I pass it off to Cam, damn
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me

Smart dude, we gettin' ignorant, this ignorant
Uh, I got that Mac with me
Yo, we never met before but there'll be a mess for sure 
When I was a baby, my crib was Mom's dresser drawer 
Infrared, blastin' guns, duckin' shots
Another K, another tank, another Glock 
They smokin' weed, shippin' E, crushin' rocks 
Forget the Porsche, they want your baby mother boxed 
And you pamper honey 
Word, he pamper honey 
And she suckin' dick for formula and Pamper money 
And a real thug don't play that
Laid back where the Mac and the K at
Yayo turned to the straight crack
Maybach black with a gat, won't say jack
Say jack, say jack, say jack, say jack
Say jack, say jack, I got that Mac with me
Hmm, hmm, I got that Mac with me

Why are we here?Girl, I don't wanna share you
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow, I hope you know
That I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by
Baby, all I'm gonna want is you
Girl, I don't wanna share you 
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you 
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow, I hope you know
That I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by 
Baby, all I'm gonna want is you
Uh, look
They told me never fall in love, it never works out in your favor
You way too young and right now that's just human nature
You think you love her, but you don't
Think you gon' be with her for the rest of your life, you prolly won't
But on my side, shorty just attacked me from the blindside
Used to be a player now I'm sidelined
Connect like Wi-fi, mixed like tie-dye
She feelin' cute wanna wear a little lingerie, voila
It ain't a sexual thing though
We be stayin' up smokin' weed out her window
In love with me now, she never huntin' me down
I'm tryna have it all, she ain't comin' around
It's like a never-endin' chase, longer than a marathon
See the smile on her face, and I can't help but carry on
Uh, I know you love me don't lie 
Uh, but you just gotta be mine, 'cause
Girl, I don't wanna share you 
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you 
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow, I hope you know
That I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by 
Baby, all I'm gonna want is you
Hey, hey, haha, look
I know this girl who want the world to call her own
Goin' through these dudes like some minutes on a phone
And once she leave, she ain't comin' back home
Hit the road, forgettin' about everybody she know
Miss Hasn't Called Me In Four Days
But then we hit the bed and she obsessed with foreplay
Hey, she try and be a lil' player, think she cute too
But I'ma yank her out the game like a loose tooth
When the boy blow, I know she worried 
About all these girls who approach me actin' flirty 
See that's the thing-thing, I don't give a fuck
I want your heart so baby give it up
In this life, girl, all we can do is try
Forget that dumb stuff, it's just you and I
We can travel 'round the world, movin' through the sky
Or we can stay right here and you'll be mine
Girl, I don't wanna share you 
We could be together, but you scared to
I ain't gonna leave you 
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you
And when I blow, I hope you know
That I could have any girl I choose
But I know as time goes by 
Baby, all I'm gonna want is youTake me
Take me—do you miss me?
Can we stop now? Melt with me—are you okay?
I'm never gonna let you go—touch me—please don't go
Where are we? Do you miss me?
Please don't go—wake up—touch me
Where are we?
I have a vision to add: the gift of subtractin' limits
If everything was gone tomorrow, who would miss it?
And if I pack my bags and moved away, who would visit?
If you knew what you should say who would listen?
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout a new religion
Somethin' to feed off, we searchin' for it like groups of pigeons
Kinda futuristic, yeah, it's cool, we different
'Cause what I do's terrific, I'm just hopin' you can feel it
Yeah, so tell me if you can
Are you numb enough? Can you listen in?
I would lose it all to show 'em I'd get rich again
But matter fact, fuck that, 'cause I don't give a damn
You see it's simple when it's only cigarillos
In the world, no one should feel you, don't expect it from a little man
Fuck empty, my glass is filled
Countin' roses, daisies, and daffodils, chill
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
What if it's gone tomorrow?
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow
So get your money, fuck 'em all
I say my prayers, but I don't know who they to
Layin' on my back, lookin' through the roof
Just tell me, am I gettin' through to you?
Stickin' to it, super glue it, make it beautiful
Fuck, what am I missin'?
Speak to your soul, so shut up and listen
Gimme a reason to pop, gettin' me goin', ain't lettin' me stop
Head to the top, it's better they not, call me a phony, so they sendin' me shots
I, got a girl, we in love, she my money, she my drugs
This my pain, this my pleasure, last forever, keep me up
Late at night, tell me it's alright, I believe her
I don't question she who knows me best, I know you wouldn't either
Somethin' happen when I see her, it's right out of a fairy tale
Got some shit she goin' through, it's something that she handle well
Life a bitch but she my bitch
Gold rollie and it's timeless, yeah
Get your money, fuck 'em all
Everythin' could be gone tomorrow

And we dream just to dream
But we don't know exactly how to get there yet
And we all wanna know

MacadelicAhem
Hey
Coming to you from a packed studio
 Haha, uh
I'm goin' in after hittin' this ganja
Out to dinner with the homies, private table at Nakama
I'm a new millennium Sinatra
Coppin' marijuana from the neighborhood Rastas
Chiefin', feastin', king of the new school
I'm speakin' in tongues, try translatin' voodoo
Hold up, let me start again
Undefeated shirt, Levis and a Mr Rogers cardigan
It's a hell of a feelin' bein' this fresh
Spit seem to sit upon my lips, call it Blistex
Peddlin' this medical, the presence of a general
Magazine centerfolds, they all up on my genitals
Got the game in the palm of my hand, it's itchin'
Wylin' out, better talk to your man, he bitchin'
'Cause I ain't got a lot time for these weirdos
Talkin' shit all up in my earlobes
I just live life, try and do it right
Everyone that hear me say "The boy is super nice"
Put a bitch up on a flight, she gon' be here by tonight
Get some afternoon delight, only eat it if it's ripe
Call me Stanley Steemer, I be givin' her the pipe
And when I'm outta town she wanna see me so we Skype
She might get obsessed and keep callin'
Thirty-thousand feet, Tom Petty, free fallin'
Just layin' back, lettin' gravity take it's course
I wanna tell all of my haters that we made it, boy
From basement studios to some official shit
From stressed out all the time to I don't give a shit
Used to dream about it, boy, now I'm livin' it
Four-one-two, it's the Most Dope syndicate
Had a normal life but now I'm sick of it
Try and spend money just to spend and it's ridiculous
Young and so mischievous
Bitches-es
And then, uh,  wants me to sing a hook like this:
A-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la
La-la-la, la-la
A-na-na
A-na-na
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la
A-na-na
A-na-naIt's 'bout to be big shit poppin' by the time this shit is droppin'
Stoppin' not a option, I'm addicted, it's a problem
This way of life, sex, drugs, rock and roll, on the road
Feelin' blessed, performin' for sold-out shows
You rappers talkin' shit, what you know 'bout those?
What you know 'bout spittin' bars and the whole crowd goes? 
It's unbelievable, these people say I made it
Throwin' down a little Henny, can't believe that I don't chase it
Life goes on, days get brighter
I'm feelin' like I came in with my haze, no lighter
So I'm lookin' for the missin' piece
Goin' down in history for rippin' beats
Smooth game, sweeter than a Krispy Kreme
You tune into my station, hope you listening
Turn it up and follow on my journey as I live my dream
All-natural Whole Foods that lay you back
Have you straight chillin' in a dope mood
And some shit is happy like a show tune
This a brand new world, I can show you 
Some people still have no clue
But they can look at all this cheese that I produce
In a world  that go round, you up or you down
You in or you out, you smile or you frown
Just get up , get up , get up , get up 
In a world  that go round, you up or you down
You in or you out, you smile or you frown
Just get up , get up , get up , get up 
Hey
Ayo, I'm fast lane switchin', rap game spittin'
Chillin' with some sour, got a bad dame twistin' 
These people think I'm goofy, say I'm Max, they trippin'
'Cause life a comedy like my last name Griffin
Livin' for the moment, blowin' potent, overloaded
And my swagger, call me Old Spice
Yeah, the kid is so nice
Smokin' in the whip, chillin', duckin' from the po-lice
So bright, you no lights, I'm shinin' like a strobe light
Leave a show with money, and I always count my dough twice
Most Dope general, and that shit is fo' life
My mama taught me well, so I even treat these hoes right, I'm po-lite
Workin' in my office, but no Dwight
Coke-white skinded, no light dimness
Me, who I am, plain sight for these bitches 
And I ain't even tryna fight with these bitches
I don't got time to spend a night with these bitches
In a world  that go round, you up or you down
You in or you out, you smile or you frown
Just get up , get up , get up , get up 
In a world  that go round, you up or you down
You in or you out, you smile or you frown
Just get up , get up , get up , get up 
YeahYeah
*Gunshot, woman screaming*
I didn't mean to pull the trigger, I swear
But now she’s dead and there ain't no comin' back once you there
I hope she knew that I loved her, I hope she knew that I cared
Your food gettin' cold, why don’t you come sit down in this chair?
We can talk about all the things we should have done
All the arguments that you probably would have won
But I'm stubborn, baby, you knew that
When you told me you loved me and I told you I loved you back
But now you layin' on the tile, I’m waitin' for a smile
So I’ll stay here for a while
When the cops come in, they're gonna have to take me away
And I tell 'em, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do it"
I guess I'm just emotional and maybe kinda stupid
I just wanna hold you close, so why'd I have to give you away?
*Gunshot, woman screaming*
I tell 'em, "I'm sorry, I'm not a bad person"
I couldn't take your pain away, I guess I'm undeservin'
But if I can't have you to myself, then you're gone
*Gunshot*
I didn't mean to pull the trigger, I swear
Life full of surprises, but that shit isn't fair
Tell me how we live is different, guess this shit kinda rare
Your food gettin' cold, why don't you come sit down in this chair?
We can talk about everything you hate on this earth
And that you're gettin' tired, 'cause you makin' it work
But can I kiss you just one more time?
Baby, lemme close your eyes, feel your lips touchin' mine
I'm sure I've never seen you look more heavenly
Now I'm rubbin' on your back, whisperin', "Rest in peace"
It's okay, baby, go to sleep
I'll keep you safe, you alone with me
Say I wouldn't hurt you, I lied
I don't deserve you, I tried
So I'ma stay by your side
But when the cops come in, they're gonna have to take me away
And I tell 'em, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do it"
I guess I'm just emotional and maybe kinda stupid
I just wanna hold you close, so why'd I have to give you away?
*Gunshot, woman screaming*
I tell 'em, "I'm sorry, I'm not a bad person"
I couldn't take your pain away, I guess I'm undeservin'
But if I can't have you to myself, then you're gone
*Gunshot*Fuck you mean, "I'm drunk," mo'fugga?
You crazy?
Shit, you didn’t say that a hour ago!

But now she think she got it like that 
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat 
Hmm, I think she think she got it like that  
Baby, you could wear my hat
Just make sure you give it back
Baby, you could wear my hat
If you got somethin' to match
Baby, you could wear my hat, just twist it to the back
We drinkin' out the bottle while you sittin' on my lap
Then we could go outside, let me take you on a ride
With the top down, show you off to people, you my prize
Nothin' like a girl who likes to wear a pair of Nikes
Shinin' like my high beams, cooler than some iced tea
Yeah, I got a female who like to send some pictures to my email
Professional with shoppin', you would think she worked in retail
Snapbacks make 'em look so cute
And that girl know how to blow somethin' like she play the flute, ha
That long hair, and it's fallin' down her back
I put on my hat, and she reach and tryna snatch it
Baby, you be hotter than a match stick, bad bitch
Make a snapback look fantastic, but sorry, you can't have this
She smile big, kissin' on my cheek
Baby, you could wear my hat, make sure you give it back to me
Baby, you could wear my hat
Just make sure you give it back
Baby, you could wear my hat
If you got somethin' to match 
Baby, you could wear my hat 
Just make sure you give it back 
Baby, you could wear my hat 
If you got somethin' to match 
She like to play those stupid games with me
She never seem to have enough
She brought some friends for whoever came with me
So, my homies sayin' that's what's up
And I hear her name's pretty, from different continent
Tellin' me she single, but to tell the truth, I'm not convinced
It's all good, I'm used to boyfriends always talkin' shit
Thinkin' that they players, but I'm coachin', call me Popovich
Baby, I ain't doctor rich, but I'll probably show you a good night
When girls come out with me, they make sure that they look right
She used to be so grounded, all the sudden she took flight
And we ain't seen her since, so tell me, what does that look like?
I'm the type to bring you right back down to Earth
And for what it's worth, I'll put that Louis on your purse
She like to wear my hat, make me laugh, so I'm guessin' she a keeper
I think she stole it though, I keep tryin' to reach her
Baby, you could wear my hat 
Just make sure you give it back 
Baby, you could wear my hat 
If you got somethin' to match  
Baby, you could wear my hat 
Just make sure you give it back 
Baby, you could wear my hat 
If you got somethin' to match

But now she think she got it like that 
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat 
Damn, I think she think she got it like that
Aha
Yuh, yuh
Baby, if you wanna wear my hat, you can wear my hat, it's not a big deal
Just give that shit back
Bl-owHaha
Mhm, don't mind if I do
Ahem
Hey
It seems like every day, I got a filled-up phone
Ladies tryna text me, sayin' that they home for the summer
And they heard that I'm livin' on my own
So they wanna come to the crib, maybe cook me some supper
But I'm busy, so I'm ignorin' her
Yeah, I just touched down in California
Now I'm headed to the beach
Go and swim in the water like I'm tryna sneak in across the border
I do all different types of crazy shit
I'm the youngin hoes tryna make a baby with
'Cause it'll make 'em rich
Know I'm headed to the money, so these funny little girls wanna take a trip
But no, only the M-O-S-T Dope with me
Other fools homo, Roy and Siegfried
No disrespect, though
I got addictive cigarette flow for the green pesto, presto
I'd like to make myself believe 
That planet Earth turns slowly 
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 
'Cause everything is never as it seems 
Yeah, I'm highly underestimated
So educated and getting paid quick
If you ever hated, anticipate that I'm famous
Got a bunch of bitches to sip on the champagne with
Celebrate that we seein' another day
Life good, never wanna end this
Me and mary jane got a really nice friendship
Yeah, they give me money, but I gotta go and spend it
Man, I been a bad little Jew
But I gotta pay the bills now, so I gotta chill out
I ain't walkin' 'round like I'm splurging with a mil' now
Feel like the kid working at the mill now
Used to just chill and smoke joints up at Bill's house
Now I got a schedule, things I gotta do
Doing interviews, see it up on YouTube
I say it feels just like a dream
'Bout to wake up from a nap, how fucked up was that? Like
I'd like to make myself believe 
That planet Earth turns slowly 
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 
'Cause everything is never as it seems
Just some motherfuckin' kids
We just some motherfuckin' kidsWhen you're young, not much matters
When you find something that you care about, then that's all you got
When you go to sleep at night, you dream of music
When you wake up, it's the same thing
It's there in your face, you can't escape it
Sometimes when you're young
The only place to go is inside, that's just it
Music is what I love
Take that away from me and I really got nothing
Hah-hah
This shit right here, this feel like a million bucks
Jerm, make sure I'm coming through clear here
Most Dope, what it is?
Ladies and gentlemen, you are now in tune to K.I.D.S., uh
Motherfucker, I feel like the hardest working kid in America
Playing with the pros, I remember being amateur
But now I'm rocking shows, see the lights from the camera phones
See my people and they hands is up
Yeah, the game a girl, trying to tease, but don't plan to fuck
My older brother told me that I'm finally manning up, 'cause
I've been a fuckup, if you ask me
But I'm still praying that my teachers gon' pass me
Letters from my soul, scriptures from the Torah
Only give you what you like, I'm a station on Pandora
Rock a sag, my girl tell me pull my shorts up
Rock solid, homie, I'm built Ford tough
Sip a little lean, smoke a little weed
We just trying to keep it cool, so we blast the AC
Some people hate, we tell 'em it's all gravy
Yeah, you got your team, but I'm fighting with the navy
Battle to the top
We in it to win it, we won't stop
No more going to stores, but don't cop shit
Never go another day with empty pockets
Houston, you there? We balling like the Rockets
And now these eyeballs dropping out they sockets
High honor roll, but not thinking 'bout a college
Love with these rhymes, want the cover of Time
Man of the Year, got my image stuck in your mind
Hold up one second
Girl, this my last L, I'ma roll it up with you
Cop some brand new shoes, put me in a good mood
I'ma bring a couple homies, you can call a couple friends
Is there a type of alcohol that you would recommend?
Being young so fun, I don't ever want to age
Haven't came down in the past five days
Just trying to tell it like it is, we the shit
You now dealing with some motherfuckin' kids
What?
Rostrum Records in this bitch 
Thank y'all for tuning in 
Let me do what I do
Most Dope, thumbs up, Pittsburgh
What up, Taylor Gang?
RD, ID Labs, Benji
Big Jerm, everybody, man
Let's do it, yeah
It's my time right now
K.I.D.S., kicking some incredibly dope shit
BitchHaha
Yeah
Had to do this one
One time
Hello, death, it seems that we meet again
You keep taking friends that I'll never see again
I guess they gotta leave
But if we pretend that they never left
Well, we gon' see them then
Never leave our heart, never leave our thoughts
As time goes by, they'll never be forgot
Life goes on, though I wish that they was there
Shit like this never gonna seem fair, yeah
So can I have a moment of silence
For anyone who's gone from the coldness of violence?
And I know you wanna see me go to college
But I'm sorry, I don't think that I'ma make it
Because this world is mine for the takin'
So when I get famous, they gon' know what your name is
And no one understand what the pain is
And how the blood run numb where my veins is
I'd like to thank you, 'cause you made me a man
Told me to never let it go, so I'm taking a stand
Always in the crowd when I played in the band
Your grandson is everything I say that I am
And maybe I am a little bit over my head
But I'm feeling so alone tryna cope with your death
Holding my breath, wishing I had one more day
Wishing you could be there when I graduate
Ugh, and it's sad to say
That no one in this room understand me
I know you had to leave, so rest in peace
But please, can you watch over Nanny?
'Cause she loved you, and I love you
All the prayers I'm saying may bug you
But I'm just checking in on what you up to
So, how they treating you up there?
Too stubborn for a cane, way too cool
Sleeping at your house, walking me to school
Thought I was a fool when my grades started slipping
When I played ball, you was always in admission
You loved me more than I've been loved before
And that's a type of thing that everyone ignores
But not me, you got me
Always and forever, Poppy
Time goes by, going without you
Hope you know I've been thinking about you
And I know, I know, I know, I know
That they took you from your home
But you're in my heart
So I'm never gonna be alone
Time goes by, going without you
Hope you know I've been thinking about you
And I know, I know, I know, I know
That they took you from your home
But you're in my heart
So I'm never gonna be aloneMm-hmm
And you know, and you know
It's the only way it go
Hey
Say, hey 
Uh
Got no problems, my weed lit, got nowhere to go
So we ride and we smoke 'til we can't anymo'
And keep floatin'
Uh
Pass it to your man, roll another one and 
When it's almost done
Why don't you go and break down enough for another one
And roll me some?
Hey, then you can pass that, the kid who rock a snapback
Steady blow this hash back until my thoughts are abstract
High to get by, that's how we livin' in this day and age
I bring some color to a world that's filled with shades of gray
Throwin' this cake away to blaze and sip some Tanqueray
Remember spectatin' 'til they picked the kid to play the game
Now I'm an all-star, blasted out the ballpark
In my Lamborghini, speedin', you a golf cart
California dreams, Amsterdam reality
Life ain't what it seems, these the thoughts that weed pull outta me
Blow through a thousand trees, the whole entire crowd get skeed
Livin' in what seems to be fiction, I'm on a balcony
I light one up, this for those who ever doubted me
Then light another, this for those who hold it down for me
Passin' around the weed, no problems at all
And you haters keep on hatin', I ain't talkin' to y'all
Got no problems, my weed lit, got nowhere to go
So we ride and we smoke 'til we can't anymo'
And keep floatin'
Uh
Pass it to your man, roll another one and  
When it's almost done
Why don't you go and break down enough for another one 
And roll me some?
Then you can pass that, we floatin' along
So much smoke, we got the words high wrote in the song
Girl, I try to come and make you smile
I'm gone, so will you wait a while?
As soon as I come home, we gon' smoke and then I'll stay a while
Some people hate my style, some people love it though
And all these kids who wanna clone me, they ain't comin' close
Politickin' joints, we countin' none of your votes
I'm gettin' everybody high, so you can puff on ya roach
Shorty used to all these players, tell her, "Fuck with a coach"
I just want you to come over, roll me somethin' to smoke
Hey, my mind be cookin' rhymes up, live until my time's up
Hate me then they love me, tell 'em try to make they minds up
Barbers and they line me up, ID was on the beat
It's best to shout the people out that help you get your cheese
Smokin' weed, we got no problems at all
All you haters keep on hatin', I ain't talkin' to y'all
Got no problems, my weed lit, got nowhere to go
So we ride and we smoke 'til we can't anymo'
And keep floatin'
Uh
Pass it to your man, roll another one and 
When it's almost done
Why don't you go and break down enough for another one
And roll me some?
Hey
Haha, that was the best day ever
What up, Wiz?
Rostrum, ID Labs
Bl-ow
Most DopeI'm gettin' faded in a undisclosed location
This ain't just a couple screws loose, it's straight-jacket crazy
I don't give a fuck if I don't find my head
Fuck it, I gave every single fuck I had left
Yeah, why'd you get so high so early
So high, so early
So high, so early
So high, so early?
Take your time, never hurry
You don't mind, I won't worry
You'll be fine, say the word, say the word
Smokin' dope, it's hard to breathe
Feelin' stuck, it's hard to leave
Roll up, smoke 'em back-to-back
If you got some, we can match
Money comin', we can stack
Dime bags, twenty bags, fifties, hundreds, grab a seven
Got some extra, that's a blessin'
Roll me up, just roll me up
DJ Pour had me sippin' that sizzurp
TDot poured me up, faded off the wake up
I got makeup on my clothes
This bitch was sleep, this loud just woke her up
I don't think I smoke enough 
Cheech & Chong my motivators
Roll a facial, think of times I hoped for cable, we was broke
If I ain't have nothin', I had hella smoke 
Leather coat, the fragrant's kush
Passed out faded before they played the hook
Got a foreign model tryna order out, she hate to cook 
I get high with Esco now, they shootin' shit, I made you look
My life is a movie, dropped out of school 'cause I hated books
I'm livin' like Rick James, still backwoods, ain't shit changed 
Mac know I'm far from sober, just started, it's far from over 
I'm gettin' faded in a undisclosed location
This ain't just a couple screws loose, it's straight-jacket crazy
I don't give a fuck if I don't find my head
Fuck it, I gave every single fuck I had left
Why'd you get so high so early
So high, so early
So high, so early
So high, so early?
Take your time, never hurry
You don't mind, I won't worry
You'll be fine, say the word, say the word
Yeah, walk in the crib, my dick smell of sex
Pussy, whiskey on my breath
My bitch buggin' when I come in, "When you gon' clean up this mess?"
See, I'm American made, there goes my brain or what's left
When I get carried away, I know how crazy I get
Cash or check, bread and butter, take a number, place a bet
To the realest motherfuckers, ain't too many of us left
You can't tell me nothin', no discussion, flow is so disgustin'
Throwin' up a whole bunch of blood on a empty stomach
Got headaches and migraines, headaches and migraines
Every single mornin', like my brain flippin' sideways
Try to move my body but my skeleton vibrates
Whose car is that and how'd it get in my driveway?
This is high stakes, professional time waste
High as Macaulay Culkin, but lower than five basements
It's competitive life ruinin' horrible influences
I stay with headaches and migraines
I'm gettin' faded in a undisclosed location
This ain't just a couple screws loose, it's straight-jacket crazy
I don't give a fuck if I don't find my head
Fuck it, I gave every single fuck I had left
Yeah, why'd you get so high so early
So high, so early
So high, so early
So high, so early?
Take your time, never hurry
You don't mind, I won't worry
You'll be fine, say the word, say the wordFuck you

You said my love was a bit too much
Broke my heart, can't find no crutch
So why don't you come on back home? 
Hey, I'm a fuckin' workaholic with a passion in my heart
Treatin' rappin' as a art in which ya have to be apart of
I just copped a new car to hear it start up
Try to do the right thing and please karma
All I want to know is where the fuck did ya have to go?
I've been waiting on you, baby
Why don't you leave and come on home?
I can't be mad, I'm livin' my dream
Though you said you think you love me
So I've been fuckin' all these hoes
And I've been blowin' all this cash
'Cause, baby, this just the beginnin'
And I'ma make all of it back
Where'd you go? What'd you do?
How the hell you make me fall in love with you?
And then you leave, now you're gone
All I got is this damn song
So I can feel but I can't touch
You said my love was a bit too much
Broke my heart, can't find no crutch
So why don't you come on back home?
Hey, hey, It's all good, everybody tryna eat tonight
Tryna go to sleep, havin' good dreams tonight
Go home, might get better
All I know: It don't last forever
So take it while you got it, try to get a little more
They say I'm gettin' better than I ever been before
Well, that's for sure, tell 'em what I do
Rap keep me fed like a spoon gettin' soup
I've been out here on the road
And now they missin' me at home
All these ex-girls that I used to know are hittin' up my phone
But I ain't here
I guess you can call back
Sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll, I think I'll take all that, haha
Where'd you go? What'd you do?
How the hell you make me fall in love with you?
And then you leave, now you're gone
All I got is this damn song
So I can feel but I can't touch
You said my love was a bit too much
Broke my heart, can't find no crutch
So why don't you come on back home?

You can cut it here, and then we're doneYeah, yeah
These motherfuckers don't know
These motherfuckers don't know, yeah
The tracklist filled up with so many mistakes, can't believe I'm alive
Will you be a saint or a sinner? Whatever you want, you decide
All day I been faded, all day I been faded, but fuck it, I drive
Now I'm in a Mercedes, the pills made me crazy, today I could die
Fall asleep in the pussy, wake up to the money, my life a cliché
I think I deserve a promotion, I think I'ma need me a raise
Tell these motherfuckers, "Keep playin'"
'Cause me, I created the game though
Stack my money and lay low, they can't fuck with my bankroll
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
I been a real one, yeah, I been a real one
Yeah , yeah
I get up with the sun, only sleep for a minute
Then back to the grind 
They party and bullshit, get wasted, I done it
Ain't wastin' my time 
I'm faded, my eyes low, so no reason to hide that I'm blatantly high
Bitches been trippin' since in the beginnin'
Don't listen every time they tellin' me lies, oh no 
All I ever wanted was to be somebody special
Couple diamonds dancin' on the dental
Cap in mind, don't mind though by the elbow, yeah, you know
Know you poppin' when you make a million dollars on the cellphone 
Money been a manifesto, said, the money been a manifesto, yeah
I'm up like espresso, the bitches say, "Hello"
I'm outta the friendzone 
I rode with the homies, where ever we go
We don't follow no dress code 
And I'm still young, gettin' faded to feel numb
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah 
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah

Let's go to Syria and have a war
Stop fucking calling me Macklemore
That's not my name
Well, kind of, it's kind of my name 
Yeah, so
I sold the mansion and moved in my mom's attic 
Life was a blockbuster but now it's a cult classic 
Smoke 'til I'm asthmatic, embracing my bad habits
Travelling down the hole, I'm chasing a fast rabbit 
Well that's acid, still weird from my last tablet
I love like a folk singer, but fuck like a crack addict
Practicing black magic and watching some car crashes
Snapchattin' a dick pic, sent it to Bob Saget 
Word  the aliens have landed 
I don't panic in my fortress made of granite 
Take life for granted, probably won't when it end
Thank God I'm sober again
Run away
Run away
Run, run, run away
Oh my...
Who let the dogs out?
Stop what you're doing and put 'em back in the doghouse
I was a human, I'm feeling like I'm a god now 
But most of the time I don't even know what I'm talking 'bout
Bitch, I'm a walking, talking crocodile 
Take a picture with my mom and crop her out
Go to her house, coked up, and lock her out
  Yeah
I'm possibly a phony, don't believe me
You can't tell that I'm so lonely from the TV 
I hate myself 'cause I'm a white rapper 
I hate white rappers  but an industry of kike masters made me rich 
Short shorts and high socks
I feel like chalk without a sidewalk
Back in the 'Burgh I'ma eat at my favorite Thai spot , what up?)
And smile as the hungry eyes watch
Run away
Run away
Run, run, run away )
Oh my...
Yeah
Still having sex with blind people 
They say my pussy smell like pine needles 
Bust a nut in the poultry section at Giant Eagle
Stare a chicken in the face like, "Bitch, I'ma eat you" 
Yeah, I'm all kinds of evil
Eating mushrooms out in London tryna find the Beatles 
I'm still sick of people
Go back to St. Bede, chief and kick it with Mr. Roedel

And once you get there, you don't ever wanna leave no-no-no, no 
Feelin' good, feelin' free
When I can finally get away
When I can finally get away 
I need to see it with my own eyes
Hope it remembers and it knows my face, face 
I'll come and see you if you don't mind
When I can finally get away

There's a place right up above the clouds 
Somewhere in between later and right now, right now 
And you don't have to be scared, no
I'll be there when I can finally get away
When I can finally get away 
Soarin' uncontrollably, gravity ain't holdin' me down , maybe I—
I'll fly to your front door some time

Get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away
Get away, get away
Get away, get away
Get away, get awayWhen I get old, I'ma be real cool
Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe they'll be makin' it big
And I know
That life is nothin' easy 
One day, I'ma change the world
And they'll finally believe me
Hey
From the outside lookin' in, it seems that I'm fine
But they don't know shit about the everyday grind
Time is money, money is time
They tell me get there at five but I'm runnin' behind
I try and live a little, go and have a little fun
You only young once, all the hatin', that be dumb
If life a joke, then I'm waitin' for the pun
You all about the beef but me, I'm 'bout the bun, the bread
'Cause I was just a little knucklehead
Now I got my shit together, spittin' what they fuckin' with
If they ain't, it's great, no attention to the hate
Nothin' changed, still cuttin' up, Henny's still my drink
I'm still the same old dude, now I'm makin' moves
It's like everything I do front-page news
I ain't playin' in this game to lose
I want it all, no secret, the change, they can keep it
When I get old, I'ma be real cool
Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe they'll be makin' it big
And I know
That life is nothin' easy 
One day, I'ma change the world
And they'll finally believe me
Hey
My grandpa told me one day I'll be everything and more
It's better never to question every lesson that's in store
See, it's a blessin' that I'm gettin' through the door
The money gon' fall, when it rain, it pour
Dear music, you're everything I have now
When there's an army comin' for me, I won't back down
'Cause I never was a kid in the background
Just a class clown, but who's laughin' now?
My moms cried when she saw me in a cap and gown
It feel great to see my family proud, but
I make mistakes too
My people always tell me, "Mac, please don't ever let the fame change you"
They say I'm so different, but it ain't true
Still got the same girl, roll with the same crew
I'm just doin' what it takes for me to make do
And everyone around me gettin' paid too
When I get old, I'ma be real cool
Sittin' on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids
Tell 'em to believe they'll be makin' it big
And I know
That life is nothin' easy 
One day, I'ma change the world
And they'll finally believe meUh, haha 
Go and ride with me, get high with me

Hey, they say, "It's so funny, you're nobody with more money"
And the hoes love me, yeah, these other kids don't touch me
Full contact rap, no rugby
Pretty boy flow, why your girl so ugly?
My bitches don't want anybody but me
They puff trees, sip liquor, and suck D
Got a lot of people worried about the things I say
And a lot of different haters that they bring my way
I let 'em grill though, they can watch the money pile
While these groupie hoes run and try to hunt me down
Now every day feelin' like the best day ever
Heard it's a long road, but it get way better
A little money in my pocket, but my eyes on a million
Got these doubters listenin', surprised when they feel him
Ballin' like Jordan, you ballin' like Wilson
Feelin' like a kid again, chillin' watchin' Gilligan
I don't think they want to interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night

Hey, hear the alarm, time to start the day
Rub my eyes, light some weed, send my mind on its way
I'm gone, somewhere to my own dimension
I, show these hoes no affection
Just party every night, gettin' so demented
At that time, I'm lookin' in the mirror, seein' no reflection
Got me wonderin', why don't they get it?
Spend the night with me, I'm sure you won't regret it
Got some liquor on the way, the weed is twistin', you should stay
You still listen when they say the kid is spittin', gettin' paid
But my differences in age got me shittin' with a rage
'Cause what's written on the page straight sicker than some AIDS
I came to get fucked up , I, I came to act wild 
You, you came to prepare for the future, I live for right now 
I don't think they want to interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night
I don't think they want to interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party

Can I, uh, can I ignore the call?
I can ignore it? A'ight
I'm feelin' a lil' ill right now
And I don't mean ill like, really cool and awesome
I mean like, I'm comin' down with a sickness
 A'ight, look
Hey
Well, I was ridin' in shotgun, speedin' down the highway
Listenin' to music, haven't slept in like five days
I try take a nap, lean my head against the window
It feels real, I swear to God this shit pretend though
'Cause, me, I get high, make music for a livin'
If that ain’t the best job, then give me your opinion
'Cause I love life, chillin' for the night, case of Bud Light
Small world for me, but you, you live a Bug's Life
Scared to chase your dreams, scared to take a risk
Think it's make believe, so you hate the shit
Valentine, love it, grimier than rubbish
You softer than a Snuggie and you sweeter than a Sunkist
Never eatin' beets, on your Doug shit
Come with all the swagger, but you lackin' all the substance
Cool, the dude you used to wanna be in school
Spendin' money, drinkin' liquor, naked girls up in my pool
Wake up in my bed, gettin' head, she said 
The act so cool, but she easily impressed
I love to lay back, watch her while she get dressed
Put herself together, last night was a mess, yes 
Today a new day , a fresh start 
If you didn't make mistakes, you wouldn't get far 
Life get hard , so we get high 
You ain't shit 'til you try 
Ayy
Ayo, my herb smoke tastin' like a Nerds rope
I'ma get rich so I can buy my bitch a fur coat
Somethin' like a millionaire in trainin'
Still my shit amazin', we jumpin' over puddles when it's rainin'
Plannin' on a tan, I'm in the sand
And we'll be jammin', make it bounce
While we dancin' on the clouds until I'm landin' in my house
Remember when my moms would hate me standin' on the couch
But now I'm makin' so much money, I start to lose count
I try and spend it quick, I got bills though
Yeah, I'm only eighteen, I got skills though
Beats, Rhymes, Life, Tribe Called Chill Flow
You been rappin' twenty-five years and you still broke
No disrespect, the riches is the art
I'm just mad at all these haters who was bitches from the start
We just do this 'cause we love it and it's settin' us apart
We was already gone while you was only on your mark, hey
Wake up in my bed, gettin' head, she said 
The act so cool, but she easily impressed
I love to lay back, watch her while she get dressed

Life get hard , so we get high 
You ain't shit 'til you try Boy a fool, wonder what's cool
Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about
I heard your mans ran cryin' to his mommy and his daddy
When the cops drove by his house, so who you tryin' to dial?
If you lookin' for a answer, you probably gon' find it now
And to the man in the hat standin' lookin' at his watch:
Motherfucker, well, the time is now
Go and clap your hands, let me hear you say, "That's the jam"
See, I wouldn't be shit if I ain't have no fans
Can't sit down, kids, you have to stand
Just put your hands up, you don't have to dance
Here, we get it poppin' like it's Pakistan
Iraq, Iran, I have them sayin', "Mac's the man"
The maximum, comin' through to pass you bums
So if you ain't got no money, better ask for some
Hey, we came to get down, have a good time
Bring the champagne out and the good wine
We gon' be sippin' and whippin' the sickest whips
Spittin' the illest shit that's sicker than syphilis
Comin' in the back door, yellin', "Fuck a list"
Fans takin' pictures while I'm tryin' to take a piss
We came to party, didn't come to give a shit
Now sing this part, it goes like this, hey

We have a good time, like to get fucked up
What? What? Goin' hard tonight
Under 21, but find me at the bar tonight
Hey, drivin' 'round in my car tonight
Makin' music that ain't hard to like

Your wife had an ass-clap contest
All the home girls tryna fuck me after
Give me head and turn me to a conscious rapper
I could tell you how the world begun ‘em
Virgin Mary slutty sister’s son
At birth I was meant to come
Take over the world and fornicate with girls and
Dog on these kitties' pearls, it was on point like Earl’s and

The meanest genius, my style seamless I’m dope as fuck
Release my thesis, a piece on demons who spoke of love
Openly cope with emotion, only the strong survive
Along with my personified dog and my bionic eyes
Life a cartoon, turn it up, you probably heard of us
We murderers and you curious what the verdict was
Release me please or believe the evil is coming for ya
It’s me and a hundred warriors armed with swords and we sorcerers
Singin’ Gloria the morning that your abortion come
And so it goes, guess I'm in love I suppose

It seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow

Superhero, utility belt tied around my waist
Tryna be next, quicker than the reflex
Tannin' down in Key West, every class recess
N-n-n-n-now my pockets deeper than ya V-neck
Hoes up on my dick 'cause I look like Ryan Seacrest
I'm buzzin' like a bees nest, stay up out my bees wax
My people like to party, so inform us where the freaks at
Livin' out my dream, people still sleepin'

Life couldn't get better, I hope it lasts forever
When I spit my verse, they gon' remember every letter like...

It seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
Hey, they seem surprised, with the look that's in their eyes
How I could be myself and do away with their disguise
I advise homies to stay homies
Few people you can trust, all the OG's told me
When I was just a shawty, strummin' my guitar
Playin' my piano, had a band in my garage
Sittin' down with the homies, playin' PlayStation
Tryna find a crib where their parents on vacation
Hey, why you grillin'? Put a smile on your face, bitch
We takin' shots all around, gettin' wasted
Came a long way from freestylin' in my basement
Show some love to the people that I came with 'cause...

You think you fly? Just wait until I pull my cape out
Hey, life is good, don't waste it

Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
It seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wowNothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
You gotta have somethin' if you wanna be with me
Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
You gotta have somethin' if you wanna be with me
I'm not tryna be your hero
'Cause that zero is too cold for me, yeah
I'm not tryin' to be your highness
'Cause that minus is too low to see, yeah
Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
And I'm not nothin', believe you me
Don't you remember I told ya?
I'm a soldier
But ain't a war that I can see, yeah
Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'

Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'

Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
You gotta have somethin' if you wanna be with meYeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm-hmm
Alright, lungs full of weed smoke
Trunk full of C-notes
Always keep a plan and a bitch with a deep throat
Came from the keystone, drink 'til my speech slow
I breathe fire, kill time, collect zeros
Comin' with that heatstroke, every verse a kilo
Whole team flyin' and my name Rick Pitino
We know, but still we fight ego
Feelin' like Michael, but you really like Tito
And all I got is dead heroes, wanna take my girl and move away to Puerto Rico
'Cause it's a freak show everywhere that we go
Shit been different ever since I did a song with CeeLo
Yeah, I make that music you can digest
Take you out your mind and let me become the pilot
Fly jets and sign checks
We don't fuck around, no joker inside of my deck
My head inside of clouds
Show me to the sky and I'll kiss it
If you blink an eye, you gon' miss it
And this will happen once in a blue moon
It's always over way too soon
I spend a hundred twenty on it just to go vroom-vroom
Homie, the wheels lookin' like soup spoons
I ain't worried, I got nothin' left to lose
You gon' be alright if you just follow a few rules
It's right now, fuck forever, we right here
Rain clouds come before the sky get clear
And just when you thought it was alright
Here come another long night
We can do better, have no fear
Death creepin' slow, don't you shed those tears
And just when you thought it was alright
It might be alright
Yeah
Okay, I spend nights lookin' like a deer in the headlights
Sweat like I'm runnin' up ten flights of steps with the left, right
From now to the next life
Only comin' out of the house when the check right
The test score a hundred percent and I don't need to study, buddy I'm comin correct
I go and get a ton of money, a ton of respect
They talkin' a ton of shit, but say it under they breath
The flow fuckin' possessed
On par with Charlotte, got 'em stuck in the web
Darn it, the flow so marvelous, I look so harmless
The sun don't shine though, my mind never low on darkness
Pardon the interruption, excuse me
You was just sayin' somethin', how rude of me
One man but I move like a few of me
I'm not human, I was built more beautifully
Mhm, and every single dream lucid
I could probably fly if these wings keep movin'
All we do is speak truth, put a beat to it
I need music to tune out the bullshit
Yeah, turn off the lights and I glow
Now that I have it, I'ma never let it go
And this for everybody, friend or foe
Yeah, friend or foe 
I fantasized 'bout this back in my early teens
I'm talkin' holes in my dirty jeans
There's no soup for me, I let the chickens out the coup to feed
See, I'm becomin' somethin' way beyond a human being
Who wanna holler for a dollar with a handout?
A little oochie wally got you feelin' like the man now
I see God every time I pull her pants down
It's the holy water 'til I'm at my only dollar
It's right now, fuck forever, we right here
Rain clouds come before the sky get clear
And just when you thought it was alright
Here come another long night
We can do better, have no fear
Death creepin' slow, don't you shed those tears
And just when you thought it was alright
It might be alrightUm, she say she love me for these cold-ass raps
Wanna be involved but no strings attached
Listen, honey, I’m feelin' kinda hungry
Go to dinner with ya girls, can you bring somethin' back?
It's unusual that I would feel so strong
The party upstairs, you waitin' in the lobby
Fuck cares, valet the Ferrari
Bright Vegas lights get alarming, I'm sorry
Too drunk for sex, I might pass out early
Just keep it wet and I'll hit it in the morning
Glory, free-fallin' 43 stories, cordially sippin' 40s
Hooked up to morphine, for sure clean like bald heads
I kinda wish that we would fuck more and talk less
Except me and you a little far-fetched
Reach for the stars, got my arms stretched, God bless
I can be there tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
I'm just caught at the light
Hope you'll be there in the morning
I can be there tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
Just hop off for the night
Know I'll be there in the morning
And I, I need a cool bitch, conversation skills
Roll blunts and in love with Darth Vader films
Love to sit there and chill when I play the keys
When it turn to fall, she love to go and rake the leaves
Make-believe, used to dream of bein' Ann Marie
Or a model for Maybelline
But fantasies tend to die off when you grow up quickly
Her walls the exact same color as a Tiffany box
Make her waffles, solvin' riddles on her Popsicle stick
If she could, she would leave in a rocket ship
The way she feel got her nervous like a doctor's trip
Mom said she should see a psychologist
Say she love me for my cold-ass raps
Never tell me where the cocaine stashed
She up late worried, tell me, "Hurry up home"
Eleven missed calls on my phone, whoa
I can be there tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
I'm just caught at the light
Hope you'll be there in the morning
I can be there tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
Just hop off for the night
Know I'll be there in the morningDon't even know my schedule, levels reachin' several
Rose petals deliver, make you feel special
They thought the money should've changed it
Slide's still blue, why the world keep tryin' to paint it?
When the life around you changes, try to keep your sameness
Try to keep your brain maintainin' through the lameness 
Sometimes I just wanna go
Back to Blue Slide Park, the only place I call home 
I hope it's never all gone , don't think it's ever all gone 
Sometimes I just wanna go
Back to Blue Slide Park, the only place I call home 
I hope it's never gone, forever long Funkmaster Flex night, yeah, yo
Put your hands up if you feel like
You a salamander , you ain't no human
You a salamander 
Put your hands up if you feel like
I'm all Red Bull and coffee right now, so I'm finna spaz
 You a motherfucking form of energy
Hargh
You ain't even, these
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Electrons, these bones just keeping it all together
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
But you full of spirits, look, uh
American born, welcome to my stomping grounds 
In point breeze, where I used to walk around my father's house 
Older brother used to always say I was adopted
Convinced I'm a Russian foster child my family forgot about 
Curious toddler, such imagination 
Didn't have the patience to be top of the class at my graduation 
Little pervert infatuated with masturbation
Couldn't wait to bust a nut, watching porn, in love with sluts 
Rusty trumpets and such, disgusting sleezy shit
12-year-old sexual deviant, got my penis licked
In seventh grade  thought I was a man now 
Couldn't understand how my parents still thought I was a little kid 
I had the mind of a 109-year-old elder man
The passion of the Christ and the memory of an elephant 
Used to wonder all 'bout heaven and hell
Witnessed death at a young age, I said to myself
We all mortals  we leave this world into eternal life
Other kids of different religions wonder which person's right 
Worry 'bout your fate, no separation of church and state
You be good, never break the law, you'll see the pearly gates 
Fuck philosophical, back to the diabolical
Binoculars couldn't see my skills, I'm way too ill for that 
I feel my raps will be underrated and under-appreciated
Until I  pow, blow my brains out 
I need to stop paying attention to opinion shit
I rather be the pen that come and sign your death certificate 
Kill your career if you give me a year 
The X Factor, whip my dick out, give Britney the spear 
Got some shit for your ears, it's something to be excited 'bout
Here to give you industry critics some shit to write about 
Me or you, who got the nicer house? 
You got a daughter of age? Might have to pipe her now 
If Sean Price is Mike Tyson now 
I might as well turn my life around and check these fools like Nike town 
What would have happened if Lance had never biked a mile?
I was blind, but I'm seeing like a psychic now 
I know the future like Atlanta 
I knock it out the park like my name was Joey Randa 
Ball like  Miguel Cabrera  or Garciaparra 
Sail the French Riviera and my camera panorama 
This radiation, sample the gamma 
I look like money, Willy Whips looks like a panda, word 
Sinister, administer bits of comic life
You bullshittin', homie, go and get your economics right 
How many MCs wanna come and test me and my technique?
Weaving through this traffic on my jet ski 
Looks can be deceiving and my raps are so friendly 
Oh, yes, my raps are so friendly 
How many MCs who wanna come and test me and my technique
Weaving through this traffic on a jet ski 
I know that looks can be deceiving and my raps are so friendly
 So you MCs commend me
Please tell me I'm good, makes me feel better
Witcha little make pretend-steez
Yeah, you ain't real
You bend the knees and then deez
Nuts are in your mouth bitch 
Fucking on your couch bitch 
Bustin' on your mothers comber button blouse bitch 
Trying to get rid of me? This ain't Auschwitz
Wow, wow, wow, that's a little...
I pound bitches in their ass 'til I got brown dick 
You surrounded 
Do you know of satan and denounce his
Doings?  Ruined, I'm out this

Hey, hey, hey, hey

Eyes half closed, heavy like they was attached to bricks
Around the world, I use my atlas, make a map of it
Globe trotter, ho hopper, superstar, asterik
People always wonder, so they ask us who we are 
Rollin' up to clubs when we too young to hit the bar 
Wanna be on top and tryna to get there by tomorrow
See the money, bitches, bubbly, designer clothes, foreign cars
But I  ain't never gonna change, different city every day
You hear these people scream my name
They think I'm underage, and don't know shit about the game
'Til I'm drunk as fuck, on the couch, pourin' out champagne
Livin' life like it's my job, and I don't ever take a day off
Shit ain't been the same since I seen my music take off
I be on some "I don't give a fuck" shit
Still with my homies I came up with
So celebrate the fact that we young, rich, and famous
I got my cup filled up 
We came to have a good time, so turn my music high
We gon' tear this place up 
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody

Hey, go Europe to Japan, then Mexico to France
Bitches of every nationality, get up and dance
So, let me see your hands please
We makin' noise like a stampede
So much smoke up in this bitch, you can't breathe
Somewhere where it's sandy, Cali or Miami
This the only way to do, and never made a plan B
Can't we get it how we live?
Tonight ain't the night to chill, tonight we do it big
Girls comin' all dressed up, then they takin' off their clothes 
You know your man a amateur, come party with some pros 
You need somethin' new, I know your life is gettin' old 
But we ain't gettin' younger, so tonight's the night to go 
So  crazy, treat it like your last night
Even if you broke, spend tonight like your cash right
This is fast life, don't you worry, baby, we ain't here to slow it down
Tonight we goin' crazy, and tomorrow you can hold me down
I got my cup filled up 
We came to have a good time, so turn my music high
We gon' tear this place up 
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody 
We party all around the world, we party all around the world
We party all around the world, we party all around the world
Let's go around the world , around the world
Around the whole wide world 
The whole wide world, go around the world, around the world

Believe in God but don't believe religion
Sayin' it's the truth but never really listened
That's another conversation though
Walkin' on the pavement home, find a way to go
Maybe one not taken, word to Robert Frost
Blowin' out steam but it's all exhaust
We comin' for your dollars, better call the cops
You want a war? We got a nuclear holocaust
Yo, E, how many bars is that?
Is it enough to give these haters all heart attacks?
I been writin' on the paper, gave me carpal tunnel
Couple billion people, are they all gon' love you?
Hell no, hell no
I be grindin' though the rain, sleet, hail, snow
Stickin' to my word like it's Velcro
On some shell toes, and what else, yo?
Dope shit, go crazy
Kinda like the Internet over Hov's baby
My girl tell me, "Mac, you a weirdo"
I guarantee that baby be a superhero
This ain't nothin' but some rhymes from my mind
That been stuck inside since the beginning of time
Chemical romance, slow dance with no pants
If I got my eyes on her, playa, you got no chance
This some simple shit I'm sure they feel
I'm just tryin' to explore what's real
Child of the blues, never liked school
Been miseducated, so word to Lauryn Hill
Music is my outlet, walkin' through the Polo store
In the studio, wonder what I go home for
In my own world when I close the door to the booth
We young and searchin' for the truth
Like that, like that, like that, like, like that, that, that, that
And a little bit of this and a little bit of that
I just spit a rhyme, tell me that I kick a rap
And if you got some time, you can sit down
Listen to me now, pass the flow around
Hey, this some cypher shit
I know you like that shit
Freestylin' in the air, go and write that shit
I don't write that bitch, I got ill flows
Yeah, I'm ill, uh, uh
And this is real, yo
Mac Miller gon' kill those
Flows
Bouncin' up and down, yo-yos
Head to your toes
In the—, in the paint throwin' 'bows

I don't think anyone's gonna listen this far
But we should keep it in
Bee-yatch!

Swim in Fallopian's of Ethiopian women
The wheels are spinning, moon is glistening, view exquisite
Now viewing witness, a youth that's twisted
Off purple liquid made to cure the sickness
Feel like my vision took a pitch shift
Smoking that Samson got me lifted
I'm the one who gave your girl cousin them drugs
Your little brother's plug, spit inside your mother's mug
Take her finest bottle, pour the liquor out for all my one's above
The last shot is for the homie's locked
Lit the crop, hit the lot
Double spin into the Guinness drop, pull off in fourth gear
Put it in park, the whores, they see me, say the Lord's here
My voice is hoarse from them 'Ports dear
Over here we don't support fear
Road to the riches and the course clear
I'm riding 'til the tires sparking and exhaust tear, it's on, yeah

We couldn't come up with a hook so we gon' just use this
I don't like ad-libs
Amen
Actavis in cactus cooler
I bit the Apple on the Mac computer, you a loser
There ain't a subject I can't tackle, either now or sooner
Ain't got no shoulder pads, but collateral pass to her
Running back, running rap, I bet you wish she knew ya'
Black Lip Pastor, hallelujah 
Soulo in this ho, that mean this church up in this bitch
Gave her a sermon then I hit, God

You can check mo millie, that was like 08's

Don't want 25, but I'll take my time
If a nigga come around, tryna take what's mine
Tryna take my life? good luck with that
We got guns for that, you not coming back
I got Fade in the bushes, lurking & looking
Bout' that life, don't get your's took quick
Just a story of some kids left stranded
Couple of the homies and a couple automatics
Come to the hood, get a good pack out
Tombstone read RIP, with your hood whacked out
You know what he about, at Ramona Park 'til after dark
They drain they pool, we swam with sharks
We shooting fools off 7th street
You make the bed in which you sleep
I stay awake like visiting dead
With the hammer sitting indiscreet, in the streets
Lo God nigga, coming through your motherfucking speakers, bitch ass nigga
Sold drugs in your granny building, in front the children
A piece of shit, I'll be considered the most
Baby hen on the dinner plate, I start the meal with a toast
Three assorted cheeses, they garnish the loaf
Cut the slices even
Distribute them to my assemblage of these fucking heathens
A bunch of demons in these Polo fleeces
I clutch the reefers and evade polices
I burn the Priest and vanish in the breezes
I talk to Jesus, reconsidered features
Rain dance on black sanded beaches
Pick from the tree that bare the fruit of peaches
Slaying these skeezers in the field of Eden
These backwoods got me with the heavy breathing
Connecting Venus and the shit the cheapest
I hit the party with the Sherm perm, ear-rings look like strobe lights
I cop the goldfish platforms for the cold price
Hop out the V in all sequence, bitch is Swedish
Suede Fedora, yeah my shit the meanest, you need it
And I'm the founder of the shit
On the forty-sixth floor, eating flounder with the shrimp
Got a awfully thick splore and I just pound her with the dick
Get the dope from out abroad, destroy the county with the shit
Piece of shit records, where dreams come true
You saying fuck me? nah, fuck you
And fuck your moms and 'em
Go fuck your Aunts daughter

Speakin' ether, I'll whip your ass and crease your sneakers 
Haters, keep the hatin', little faggots figure skatin'

Some nasty-ass food from the cafeteria 
You'll have and hear me, bruh, if you pass me up at lunch

Like any given Friday, I roll up to your driveway
Rock you in the face, have you lookin' out and sideways
So step back, 'cause you ain't want it with Mac
The young cat with the rap to leave you flat on your back 
And as a matter of fact, I'm like crack on the track
With my cap to the back, I'm the cat in the hat 
Yeah, we rhymin' like Dr. Seuss
So be careful 'fore you end up on the news

Them ass cheeks, girl
Them ass cheeks like twins
But which one was born first, baby?

Girl, your ass cheeks got a mind of their own
Which one had better SAT scores, girl?

Baby, if your ass had a face
What expression would it be making when
I put my tongue inside that asshole and lick around like

Girl, fuckin' with you is like
Fuckin' with a girl with a nice ass

They get hard when I rub 'em gently
And pinch 'em just a little bit
But I ain't tryna hurt you, girl
No, I don't wanna hurt you, girl
Unless you talk about the way that
Your pussy gon' be hurtin' after I get done with it
Girl, I'm just tryna have some fun with it, oh

You suck on my balls, you a champion
Girl, you a champion, girl, baby, baby

Punch you, give that ass a bloody nose
Ooh, I'm fuckin' crazy
And I wouldn't marry you if you fuckin' paid me a million dollars
'Cause you ain't shit but a real good pussy
And to be honest that pussy ain't even that good
I just think it is because when you horny, everything seems incredible
You probably just a regular ass bitch and I'm trippin'
Oh, I'm on a roll, girl, I'm trippin'
Missionary, doggystyle
Ride the dick, get wild, girl
From the side, do a split
Turn around, now suck my dick

I know I'm gettin' fat, so are you down with that?
Ooh, baby, give that ass a slap, yeah, I like it, girl
And don't you try and put your tongue in my asshole
'Cause that's way too nasty for me
And I ain't gay, but I like a girl to rub on my asshole
When she sucks my dick, is that weird?
Maybe, girl, when I eat your pussy, can you feel my beard?
It's crazy, girl
I'm a nasty motherfucker
In the Gap wearin' khakis, motherfucker
And don't you dare ask me for a rubber
'Cause I don't have those
Ayy! What the fuck's wrong?
Can I talk about your ass in a song?
Have you ever seen that ass in a thong?
Ooh, get low, baby! Oh, girl
I'll fuck you while I'm listenin' to Taylor Swift
Ooh, that's some player shit
See, at the end of the night
I might get you a Gatorade 'cause, bitch, you need to catch your breath
'Cause I just fucked the shit out of you
Ooh, I fucked the shit out of you, but don't you bleed on my sheets
Girl, you bled on my sheets!
Now it's been red for a week
You bled on my sheets and stained them
My dreams have been red for a week
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I just want you to know that you are not mine
Oh, yeah
I heard you fucked Justin Bieber
Let me tell you that's fine
Oh, baby, that's fine
But let me ask you one question, girl
Was his dick bigger than mine?
Don't tell me, "Yes," I might get depressed
Oh, I'm walkin' in Rite Aid
And I see the milk section
What kind of milk do I get? Baby, what kind of milk do I get?
There's so many choices, so much variety of milk
I couldn't help but think of you
And all the things I want to do in the milk section
Girl, me and you is like the milk section
But sometimes you need orange juice
And sometimes you need a little bit of both
But don't drink too much milk 'cause you'll be congested
Oh, and somethin' manifested in my mind
I said, "Hey! Hey! Cashier, you didn't give me the correct change"
And I can't deal with that right now
'Cause my mom gave me twenty dollars and said
"Bring back my damn change"
You gon' make that lady go insane, yeah
You gon' make her lose her mind, oh, girl
I know what you like when you think of the perfect man
I bet you didn't think of me
And that's why I hate you, girl
But love is what we makin', girl
And you a little sloppy, naked girl
You might wanna tighten that up
'Cause ain't no famous celebrity gon' fuck you
When you look like that
Oh, you gotta get good, start eatin' on the right track
And, baby, it's alright that
The first night, you let me pipe that
Never been with no white rapper
How was it?
Ooh, how was it, girl?
Was it everything you dreamed, or was it disappointin'?
Oh shit, that might need some ointment
Oh, girl, you ain't no ho, you just know what you want
And I got what you need, ooh, I got what you need
So, give that pussy to me
And I'ma do the right thing, I'ma do the white thing
And treat that pussy disrespectfully
Oh, your pussy don't get what it deserves
I'ma cum fast, it's cool, jack myself off, then I come back
Ooh, fuck that
Baby, I'll fuck you and rap in your ear at the same time
Pick a song, I'm a jukebox, girl
And I can sing to you
You got some friends? Please bring 'em too
'Cause we could have a threesome
Sorry, I think I missed that note, I missed that note
Oh, let me tell you this story
Ooh, I was walkin' at the flea market the other day
And I saw
Half-price lamps
And I scored, 'cause my livin' room's lackin' some light
So, I bargained with the nice lady and said
"Can I get four for the price of three?
It's alright, you see? Just be nice to me"
And she said, "Who the fuck you think I am?
This a 1970 vintage lamp, you can't find these anymore
Don't even sell them in stores"
That's how serious this dumb bitch was about her lamps
I said, "I know your pussy is dry, but this dick gon' make it damp
Fuckin' tramp, that's what you are
So, bitch, put them lamps in my car
And I'ma go home, and I'ma watch late-night television"
Said, I'ma watch late-night television, girl
I can't pick between Leno or Letterman
Leno or Letterman? Leno or Letterman?
And I like Fallon too, and I like Kimmel too
And I like Craig Ferguson
But I can't understand a single fuckin' word that he says, girl
All these words in my head, what happened to SNL?
It used to be so funny, and who the fuck is Fred Armisen?
Baby, baby, how'd he get that job?
But let me not spend no time hatin' on another man tryna get his
'Cause I'm just tryna get mine, and I'm gettin' off subject
Isn't this a love song? No
This is just a fuck song, whoa
So that's what I'ma do, ooh, baby
Let me tell another story
Earlier today, I was flippin' through channels on the cable when I
When I came across one of those commercials for sick dogs
And I hate that shit, I hate eatin' a cheeseburger
And watchin' a video about animal cruelty, 'cause I know that shit happens
But I like to forget it and enjoy my cheeseburger, yeah
'Cause I can't help but like it, girl
I know th—, I know they treat those cows like shit
And I ain't really with that, but I ain't no gay-ass vegetarian
I like beef, yeah, I like beef
Oh, baby, I like beef
Baby, oh, let me tell you somethin' else
And I was on the internet the other day
Did somethin' a little vain
I typed myself into Google verch—, Google ver—, Google Search... 'scuse me
And what did I see?
Oh, you ask me, what did I see? I'll tell you right now
I saw some shit
I clicked on the first picture, and I enlarged it to full screen
And what did I see? You wanna know?
What I saw was so disgusting that I wanted to retire
I'ma tell you now
What I saw, what I motherfuckin' saw
What did I see?
I had something stuck in my teeth
I think it's lettuce, girl
From that turkey burger I ate when I was out at Turkey World
Oh, baby, do you like some jerky, girl?
No, no, fuck that
Suck my motherfuckin' dick
I don't play around, I'ma take this dick, I'ma lay it down
Oh, yo, I'm not gay, I love pussy
Ooh, I dream of pussy, I draw pussy
I write about pussy like it is some type of false idol
It really is 'cause y'all be prayin' on that pussy
Y'all be worshippin' that pussy
Y'all be on Instagram commenting bitches' pictures
You thirsty for that pussy
And I ain't really with that
Oh, I ain't with that, girl, yeah, yeah
Would you fuck me?
Would you fuck me if I looked more like Channing Tatum?
Is that the type of guy you like?

Where Are you?)
Un souffle, une veine qui bat, un frisson
Chaire de poule, les lèvres qui tressailles
Tressaillir, Trembler brièvement
Sursauter a cause d'une émotion

I whisper in her ear, it makes her smile 
Loud as I'm fuckin' her
Smooth like I'm in love with her
Tingles up my spine every time that I'm touchin' her 
I love her like pussy, money, weed
When I'm hungry, I will feed
So for dinner, she cooks food with four different types of cheese
In the sheets, we have dessert until it hurts 
Feelin' on her curves 
I pet up on that pussy 'til it purrs 
Touch me, touch me, I'm sure it's her that loves me
'Cause I could make the Virgin Mary fuck me, trust me

But wanna roll with my peoples, let Mac get that brain 
Yeah, Mac has that game, so see how he plays it

Girls wanted me when I was chubby with some braces

The taste is delicious, her lips give me kisses 
Throw her in the kitchen and she's makin' me dishes
Her dinner ain't right, I'll admit it's smellin' awful
That girl can make a batch of Belgian waffles a jawful 
Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet

Grab a ounce or bigger, then I bounce like Tigger 
Count three dollars up and grab a pack of some Swishers
I'm feelin' stoned, I got my cigarillo rolled
Filled with green isle like an armadillo's nose 
I'm sniffin' out the hoes that light the piff and wanna throw
Then we spliffin' up the dro as I'm slippin' off her clothes
Not a player like pun, there's more flavors to come
No long-lastin' girls, they Life Savers, not gum
But I could use her beauty 
They can take her to a movie
But that girl be gettin' more love than Lucy
So I can't complain , or contain these broads
I feel like I'm like the white Flavor Flav with broads
Shorty got a ass, a body, plus her face is bomb
They runnin' after me, yo, restrain 'em, dog
They gon' tackle me 
Rip clothes off and saddle me
Mac, wake ya ass up and hop into reality 
I guess hoes ain't here kissin' my feet
But I do got a fine new bitch every week 
I said I guess hoes ain't here kissin' feet
But I do got a fine new bitch every week, so don't sleep

J-J's on my feet, J-J-J's on my feetRecently it seem like everywhere we go
The drinks stay cold when we coolin', coolin'
And being broke starts to get a little old
My money had to get some fine tunin'
Tonight might be the night I make it
So let's live it up and don't regret it at all 
All these faces, different places
People hit me up but I'm forgettin' to call 
Get away to California when the weather gettin' colder
My honey's by the pool and umbrellas in mimosas
Chillin' at the beach house, loungin' on the sofa
Ridin' with a chauffeur, on my way to blow up, stoner
Roll up, fishin', champagne sippin'
Five-star chef stay cookin' in the kitchen 
But makin' only the good shit 
See the way I'm living, they like "Oh my goodness"
I tell 'em I'm fine 
I ain't got a damn thing on my mind 
And, baby, all we got is time 
Let's just watch the clouds go by 
Ah, ah, ah, ah
And there ain't a need to panic
Girl, we can lay up on this hammock
No need to pose here, everything candid
Livin' in the moment, feelin' so splendid
Bottles on me, you can put it on the debit 
I'm just tryna have fun tonight
So everybody wang chung tonight 
Girl, you can fall in love tonight
'Cause trust me, I'ma fuck you right
Got my Louis shades on, ain't a damn thing wrong 
Fillin' up cups 'til the bottle all gone
We just coolin', coolin'  feel the breeze
Decided to give you something you could sing off-key, like
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
 Uh, I puffin' that
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
 Hehe,  yeah
I tell 'em I'm fine
I ain't got a damn thing on my mind
And, baby, all we got is time 
Let's just watch the clouds go by
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah
Haha
That's that smooth shit, Jerm
That pimp shit, dude
Oh yeah
Thumbs up
HahaYa, uh
I rap better 'cause I'm mad clever, hahaha
Ya, ya
Oh my God, haha
Hey
Yeah, they always want that fun shit
When you tryna spit a little somethin' real
They start runnin', turnin' chicken like a nugget meal
How the fuck I feel? Kinda like a hundred mil'
Spun the wheel, bought a vowel, I don't owe you nothin' still
Fuck a deal, I can do it with my own team
Won before Sheen, hear how all these hoes scream
When I was 14, sippin' on my OE
Tryna marry money, but that bitch kept gettin' cold feet
Music loud, hear it bangin' through the whole street
Beat gettin' shit on, ha, toilet bowl seat
No sleep, just work
Got a couple horny girls in a see-through shirt
So believe my hype, muthafuckas can't read nor write
Still they talkin' shit, man, I've seen your type
Got problems, can't sleep at night
'Cause your girl want to come around, freak all night
I'm a sex drill when I'm rollin' off them X pills
Five bikes, ten wheels, girl, I'll leave your legs still
Say, "I don't do drugs, just weed," haha
Well, I'ma do drugs and speed down the street
Do doughnuts, your flow sucks, you so butt
Your girl's gettin' throat fucked, I get high, I go up
Why you sayin' that he's a trend?
Then come to all his shows just to meet your friends?
So much coke sniffed, fuckin' hoes with bloody noses
Just a couple doses, fuck the roses
Class time, better take good notes
You bitches couldn't touch me with a Facebook poke
Bitch, hahahaThis what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Talkin', y'all wastin' your hatred
Shit, I'm just happy that I made it
I'm just happy that I made it
Yeah, this what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Talkin', y'all wastin' your hatred
Shit, I'm just happy that I made it
I'm just happy that I made it
Comin' live from the 'Burgh like the first time
Know what it is 'fore you even hear the words rhyme
Chosen one, the coldest soul, focus whole, so dauntless
And you know I'm from the PA, PGH
Where all the weed blaze
Where they work three jobs, no free days
Yo TreeJay, look what we made, and where we came from
So let them say somethin'
And let them hate us
And nothin' change up
Forever came up, we made it
Let a motherfucker go say shit
One for the ages, this is one for the ages
It's outrageous, spectacular how I use a vernacular
To rap a word, slap you backwards, shit has to hurt
Hit a home run and come back to first, yeah
Backstage, no passes work
With a light-skin bitch, get her ass to twerk, yeah
This the work of a master person
But it sound like Catholic church, God damn
Who the man with the hot hand?
They go nuts when I drop jams
I shake it up like a pop can
But I'm doin' numbers like a motherfuckin' rock band
Yeah, won't stop till I'm
The motherfuckin' greatest
Yeah, the motherfuckin' greatest
Yeah, the motherfuckin' greatest
Yeah, the motherfuckin' greatest
And I won't be not everybody's favorite
Not everybody's favorite
But I won't stop 'til I'm the motherfuckin' greatest
Yeah, the motherfuckin' greatest 
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Talkin', y'all wastin' your hatred
Me? I'm just happy that I made it
Happy that I finally made it
Yeah, this what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Talkin', y'all wastin' your hatred
Me? I'm just happy that I made it
Take you to back the basics, yeah
Here, face this
AlrightCheck, it's 6:26 in the morning. I just made this beat 'cause I realized that I enjoy playing the piano
Ah you know, fuck you. No one is in the room with me right now so I'm gonna record myself
I'mma try and do this all in one take, so there's not a lot of editing 'cause I'm too drunk to edit. And that's just the truth of the matter
Alright, let's go
Uh, I said raps is cold, about 20 below
I just realized I don't give a fuck any mo'
Used to look into the mirror asking where will this go?
Got big quick, kinda wish that I was taking it slow
It takes balls to go and break from the mould, I guess I did that
I still got some dumbass fans who want K.I.D.S. back
And I forget that they twelve years old
I must accept that, should probably stop thinking so much and just rap
I wish life was kinda easier to figure out
I wish it was like Ferris Bueller singing "Twist and Shout"
I got a couple reasons that I'll stick around
But for the most part this shit is foul
I place my hand on a stovetop to see if I'm awake
I heard you taking bath salts and eating people's face
Saw the people I know personally
I see they act a certain way because they workin' for me
And if you take that as a diss it means I'm talkin' to you
Know I never look down, I got knots in my shoe-strings
Made some money, went and bought me a few things
This ain't shit I'm just doodling, haha
I'm sick of going to the movies and people looking at me
Inquire 'bout some shit that they know they shouldn't ask me
Hollywood got every girl around the world fasting
Like eating was a sin, when really beauty lie within
Guess I wouldn't fuck me a fat bitch
I just disagree wit'chu determining fat is
Wanna go to Israel and see if there's a God there
For now I'm 'bout to smoke some blunts and post in this lawn chair
Could of been the mayor 'cause I'm excellent with politicking
People never say what's on their minds because they on a mission
Who do you think you are?
And may God damn your soul if you forgot tradition
Locked inside a box, a prison, somewhere there I saw a vision
Met this girl with innocence and stole it while on top of linen
Rocket, word to Roger Clemens, that don't mean a thing
I'm in love with making melodies but scared to even sing
For you judgmental fuckheads, talking 'bout my life
You don't know me and if you did you'd say I'm nice
Everyone I see always has some cool advice
'Bout what they'd do if they were me and all the issues they would fight
You could never fathom what this shit is like
And I hope you turn your bitch to dyke
My kryptonite is me
YeahYeah, yeah 
That's right 
Yeah, yeah )
, Mac)
Uh
Yeah
All I got for these niggas is expletives and slugs
All I got for these bitches is big dick and drugs
Alcohol and guns, don't be scared now you got it, thug
Smart enough to chill the fuck out until it's time to dump
Release so much rage in such a short space
I'll put your face in your cornflakes, mob style
You gave them Goma power, your honey want it, nigga, hold it down
Hood nigga, she love my style, I knocked the cat out, nigga
I'll pull a Lufthansa, nigga, is that your bitch?
I took that back to the casa, I'm always pulling the heist, I can't help that
Bitches wanna, to know what that ride be like for just one night
I blow up mine and get low, there's to much dough out here to be broke
So I hit the curb and bend a few corners bumping this shit here
Turnt all the way up, niggas getting robbed tonight, let's be clear
Come up off of them things, a nigga gone die tonight, I leave you here
You give me your valuables, no funny moves, I swear
Uh, uh
A man walked in with a smile on his face and a loaded .45 in his hand 
Told the clerk "Don’t move, I didn't come here to shoot, but I will, so you must understand" Bang!
Shots in the air, no time to waste, been doin' drugs all day, now his mind erased 
Fuck the register, he better find the safe, get the money, hit his homies up and congregate 
I need bread, my kid need to be fed, this is the recession, going through depression 
I ain't done sinning 'cause I ain't done winning  gotta be fucked up to make it to the top, where the money at?
I could be next to me, Death in Venice, work at CVS and one day you’ll manage 
Rejects, emotionally damaged, you kids need a shrink, let me call Rick Moranis 
Want to get a crib in Atlantis  knock a bitch out cold, she Rick Rambis 
Tell Dorothy we ain't in Kansas  livin' in this world, but we don't understand it  no
Bullshit, you can't sell that  all these kids who get held back 
My cup filled and my L fat, thinkin', 'we just want Dave Chappelle back'
Run and tell that, I’m coming through the function  too disgusting for discussion 
Yep, that's Alchemist on production, little bit Larry Fishy, it's nothing 
God vs man  lion vs lamb  competition ain't shit 
I'ma treat you all like my bitch   start by sucking this dick!
Biotch
*Gunshot*I know you gotta feel this
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit
I know you gotta feel this
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit
I know you gotta feel this
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit
I know you gotta feel this
I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit, I'm on some real shit
I pull my hoodie down and take a look around
Sounds that shook a town, man it feel good to smile
So I shouldn't frown when the night is lookin' down
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who the smoothest crook around
Taking some dollars and making away from Impalas
Shakin' the Jakes cause they chasin' the face of a robber
Actin' goofy, absolutely
Cause my passion suits me, so blast the tunes please
I see the world with four eyes, hip-hop tour guide
Hear the war cries, rap or die
Wanna get signed, drive a four door ride
Be more fly
Til then I'll just soar by
With a wave
I'm a bat in the cave
Sit back in the shade when I'm passing the haze
Misbehave, I'm a trouble-making teenager
Be grateful he's able to please haters
Seat taker, three-term Mayor
Getting re-elected just three terms later
I've seen greater days so let the haters play their game
Dreams fade away when you make the predator the prey
The ace of spades can make it's way to save the day
But from the start a club of heart was diamond
Now I'm in Zion flying through the skyline
The game on my back I got five spines
Black cat with nine lives
Time flies by
So I got one life to loose it
But how will I use it
Uh, I put it all in the music
Cause ya'll pussy
Fold away before they hand your cards
Broke-ass rapper now you Dancing With The Stars
I'm handling these bars like a simple situation
Basing on them cats who don't fit in the equation
Patience is a virtue but fuck it I want it now
Get my record deal ready, get Diddy up on the dial
Hello wassup Puffy, I'm on my grind and hungry
Throw me to the people they gon' love me, trust me
Cause these older cats are getting a little rusty
It's time for a change like Barack said
And I don't care
Hip-Hop is not dead
Spit hot lead, but none of these haters get shot dead
They don't bother me, I'll leave them playin' for my wife
Kick back have a laugh while you complain about your life
"Grrr" you hate Mac and you say you gonna fight
It's all good bro, you entertainment for tonight
Like I'mma be mad you hatin' cause I'm white
Do a lot a cryin', lettin' pain out on the mic
Cause overall I'm iller than most of ya'll
Yall pussy, never ever gone for it all
You scared of a little risky coachin' call
What happened, I thought you were the know-it-all
I stay smokin' well haze got a potent smell
It take me back to kickin' raps back in Show-And-Tell
I wanted to show people, all of my bro's peoples
Have a dude come up like "Yo, I know people"
The need for Dead Presidents, this dough evil
So lethal, police'll always try to beat you
Seat you down try and have you run your mouth
Bring your mother out, look what your son is now
See my mom she know her son is well
The youngest child, she been through it for a while
Now I put 911 on the dial with a smile
Cause I'm wild, foul child style
Too focused on my grind to ever catch an "f"
My heart in it down 8 with five seconds left
I want the best, won't settle for nothin' less
And I always stay dressed in somethin' fresh
So keep your head on straight and show respect to the game
And that's what this beat messaged my brainUh
The High Life
You know I stay on the move
Memories don't live like people do 
They always remember you 
Whether things are good or bad 
It's just the memories 
Memories don't live like people do 
Baby, don't forget me 
I'm a traveling man, moving through places 
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do 
But lord willing I'm coming back to you 
Baby boo, I'm a traveling man, moving through places
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do  right here)
But God willing I'm coming back to you 
Baby boo
Uh, uh, uh
Look, look, yeah
Yeah, I keep my bags packed, always back on the road
Headed back to baby girl right after the show
But now I got clothes, hoes, piff and kicks
Always twist a couple spiffs while I'm in the whip
First thing, you need to gas, hit the pump, fill the tank up 
Tell my homie at the register to stay up 
I'm on the parkway, feeling like a straight month
Going through the tunnel 'bout to break up 
Phone gets hanged up, tunes turned way up to the max 
Hit the L twice then pass it to the back—breath 
My medication comin' in for recreation
Ain't no pause or hesitation, tryna catch my respiration
I ain't never had no patience, so I'm hardly ever waitin'
Just creatin' money makin' with creative preparation 
Sick of all these cats with false representation
Too bigger words? Maybe need some translation
Intellectual boy, figurative with language
And that there  that ain't shit 
You feel me?
The High Life, and I'm gone 
Memories don't live like people do 
They always remember you 
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories
Memories don't live like people do
Baby, don't forget me
I'm a traveling man, moving through places
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do 
But lord willing I'm coming back to you 
Baby boo, I'm a traveling man, moving through places
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do 
But God willing I'm coming back to you 
Baby boo )
Look, look
My plane coming down and I'm happy to land
Every time I gotta go my girl grabbin' my hand
Tryna pull me back to her, and as mad as I am 
I gotta make this money, I'm a travelin' man 
So through airplane, boat, or packed in a van
Baby, I'ma hurry back to you as fast as I can
It don't matter what I gotta do  dreams: I gotta follow you 
Love is what I fall into and ever do it follow through
So I'ma put it all on you  just know that I ain't got a clue
But, baby, I be watchin' you coppin' you some Prada shoes 
Hurt me when I watch the news, the doctors in the hospitals
Tryna heal the sick, but all their chances is impossible 
Givin' the word like literature
Spittin' the verse for all of those who live in the 'Berg
I travel the world, the land and the sea
Just here to open up your mind, just hand me the key 
Memories don't live like people do
They always remember you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories
Memories don't live like people do
Baby, don't forget me
I'm a traveling man, moving through places
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do
But lord willing I'm coming back to you
Baby boo, I'm a traveling man, moving through places
Space and time, got a lot of things I got to do
But God willing I'm coming back to you
Baby boo
I'm leavin' on a jet plane
And don't know when I'll be back again
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me
Go They know it, but I do, I do 
Fuckin' with it, then you my dude, my dude 
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got they thumbs in the air
I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you fuckin' with it, then you my dude, my dude, uh
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got they thumbs in the air
Hey, everything good right now
Little bit of molly make the boy bite down
Thinkin' I could finally figure out my style on the stage
Lookin' at a big hype crowd
'Cause we don't give a fuck, don't need to act our age, hey
When I'm old, I'ma spend my days
Layin' with my girl on the beach in the shade
Have every single thing I can name
Thank God everyday I don't sleep in the rain
Blessed with some success, so I'ma try my best to
Live my life right, when I see God, he'll be impressed 'cause
I've been on my grind, thinkin' I'll be fine if I take my time
Workin' so hard, might break my spine
So all y'all see this face of mine
There's different ways to shine, I'ma find my own
Know when I disappear, I'ma find my way back home 'cause...
I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you fuckin' with it, then you my dude, my dude, uh
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got they thumbs in the air
Days go by, and I think that I
May be goin' crazy, maybe lose my mind
Lookin' at a constellation
Me and God have a conversation
God and I, sorry about the lingo
Just kick it in the cut, playin' bingo
I be all over the beat like Ringo
Look sweet, honey bee gonna sting though
I'm here, wanna do my thing
You can roll no matter who you bring
Like your wifey wanna lose that ring
I don't pay her no mind
I just want, I just want, I just want the paper
Bring the game, just a little more flavor
Say, "What up?", take a flick with a hater
Throw a deuce like, "See you later"
Ha, that's funny, all I really want is a little cash money
Then life gonna be so sweet
Nah, it ain't a hotel, ha-ha-ha
Yeah, nah, it ain't a hotel
I'm next, shh, don't tell, ha
]
I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you fuckin' with it, then you my dude, my dude, uh
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got they thumbs in the air
I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you fuckin' with it, then you my dude, my dude, uh
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got they thumbs in the airMost Dope, hey
Andrew Lloyd, my fuckin' man
Hey, uh
With my backpack on as I dip from class
If my mom see I'm gone, she gon' kick my ass
Hop in the whip and laugh, I got some piff to grab
Then go and scoop TreeJ, then sit and pass around the weed
While we talk about life and all the different ways to get rich overnight
Shit, I think I'ma be a billionaire
But, this life here ain't really fair
I try to do my own thing, be a little different
See, I'm just tryin' to spit about this life that I'm livin'
And if it was a game, I be playin' extra innings
Never be the same, tryin' to find out where I fit in, uh
I'm in the sky, but I haven't found a limit
So I'ma keep risin' for another couple minutes
Until I reach maximum altitude, Himalayan mountain view
I get refreshed without a Mountain Dew
They wonder 'bout this Malcolm dude
Oh, that's just my government name
No Republican, you never see me runnin' with lames
I got the Most Dope with me from city to city
Lookin' for a spot to get tipsy
Carry music that I Hussle like Nipsey
The type of bars puttin' stones in your kidneys
I think I found my passion
Used to play sports, now all I play is Madden
Hey, I used to hoop like Okafor
Now there's Henny bottles where all of my trophies were
The boy's from the north, married to the speaker
If you don't know me, it's nice to meet ya
Haha, yeah, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
It was all a dream, I used to read Vibe magazine
Picture myself right on the cover lookin' clean
With some size thirty jeans and a medium tee
You ain't fresh 'til it fit right, get like me
See, he never tried to be a G
Tricks is for kids, got 'em hidden in my sleeve
Which cover my tattoos, oh yeah, Script shit
While this Earth stay spinnin' like a kickflip
A misfit in this clique-filled world
Groupies tryin' to holla while I'm chillin' with my girl
'Cause I'm all that, ha, no Nickelodeon
Address the class when I'm standin' at the podium
They don't believe me, guess I'm the only one
See this path gets slippery, petroleum jelly
Sittin' by the tele watchin' movies
I be Up In The Air, no George Clooney
Killin' 'em softly with The Fugees
Walkin' in the party like I own the place, "Who's he?"
Somebody answer that, you see them stand and clap
The boy got presents like Santa's bag, haha
Just some motherfuckin' kids
We just some motherfuckin' kids
Tryna get it how we live, do it big
Just some motherfuckin' kids
We just some motherfuckin' kids
Tryna do it big, get it how we live
Homie, we the shit, ha-haDealin' with everybody's opinion, tryna do me
Only down one, I'm in the final, shootin' threes
Like I don't give a fuck, music, we fuck and switch the position up
We love the things that keep on bringin' out the kids in us
Been workin' all my life to do some different stuff
And people have the nerve to say I'm young and haven't lived enough
I'm on the road, my girl so sad I'm gone
It's hard when I can't even find the time to call my mom
And she thinks I'm goin' Hollywood, I guess she probably should
It seems like people see the bad and don't acknowledge good
I feel the shade, but I can see the sun, I'm cool
I've got the time, but feel the need to run, a fool
Is what I've become, young and I'm dumb
Been spendin' cake to get some bump in the trunk
Drums with a pump
Like some Reeboks, see me from the treetops
They worry, but they need not, heatin' like a teapot
Now I think I'm cool 'cause I got a pair of shoes
And mo' dough, a jacket with a Polo logo
My cup always filled with Henny, so no Fo' Loko
But they should know, so
I could go slow
You see that I'm smooth now
Used to ignore me, they study what I do now
With some help from Kweli, and it's Like on the Beat
It's cool to say that my cypher complete
Word
I'm so sick with the verbs I use, the words that heal us
They love how we kill it on stage, man, Murder theaters
No wonder they call it a bunk, I sleep in a coffin
Dead tired, exhausted from how often I be tourin'
So gangsta, like the occupation of Made Men
Creatin' chaos, my operation is Mayhem
The movie never stopped, the frame change over
We added Mac to the wolfpack, Hangover
That Hen is not a friend, I'm on that Lagavulin
Whatever substance, I abuse it like a grown man
You're not a kid no more, no one to hold your hand
And Four Loko make your shoulder lean like a Dro fan
Go ham, like Abraham readin' all the Psalms
Oh yeah, and don't forget to call your moms
Same thing I told Bow Wow last year
Take care of the fam, 'cause it's all we really have hereYeah, we gon' start this one like this
Driving down the road with a couple more miles to go
I'm so close but they don't know
Got some freaky hoes and weed to blow
Rock the cleanest clothes
My life different from every single kid you know
Places I go out on my own
Hoes stay blowing up my phone
But, I wanna be left alone
Doing shows, hitting four, five cities in a row
Hit me with some dough, 'cause they know I'm 'bout to blow
You can always say, "No", if you wanna lay low
Girl, you look so good you need to get up on the floor
Don't you feel good, don't you feel great?
I feel so fly and I hope you can relate
I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee
It's the same old dude but a brand new me
I've been up and I've been down
Thought I was the coolest motherfucker around
But, I'm just another face in the crowd
I said, "I'm just another face in the crowd"
They tell me it's impossible to do it, I'd be stupid if I tried
But I'm using a maneuver, keep on moving 'em aside
I'm just trying to make some music for the ride
Listen to it when you drive, destination, you arrive
Russell Crow, just a beautiful mind
Got talent, imagine what I'll do with some time
I'm giving you a high feeling, moving your spine
Usually, find me chilling up in Jupiter
I'm so happy when you mad, Khakis, let 'em sag
Mom says, "You could see my ass" and she laughed
Blindfolded on the turnpike, hoping I don't crash
Stashing the weed under the passenger seat
Hope these sixteen wheelers don't crash into me
People taking pictures when I pass in the street
Zoom by, don't fasten my seatbelt
And now you know how we felt 
Don't you feel good, don't you feel great?
I feel so fly and I hope you can relate
I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee
It's the same old dude but a brand new me
I've been up and I've been down
Thought I was the coolest motherfucker around
But, I'm just another face in the crowd
I said, "I'm just another face in the crowd"
Don't you feel good, don't you feel great?
I feel so fly and I hope you can relate
I got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee
It's the same old dude but a brand new me
I've been up and I've been down
Thought I was the coolest motherfucker around
But, I'm just another face in the crowd
I said, "I'm just another face in the crowd"Ayo, I'm livin' the high life
Fly clothes, good liquor, good weed 
Fine hoes, those are things I'ma need 
We make these ladies pants wet when we grab the mic
And we gon' have 'em like 
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la , la-la-la-la, la, ayy
Sit back, relax and move slow 
We're now in cruise control 
Uh, Wizzle man, the fans: can't keep 'em off me
Always reppin' for my city even though I don't see it often
Yeah, as a youngin' learn it's best to keep from talkin'
I only say I'm the best cause that's what the people call me
And I'ma keep shinin' 'til the day the Reaper call me
A lot of shit on my chest so I suggest you keep from round me
Tryna slander my name but when you sit think about it
It's hard to show off your aim when niggas yet to see the target
He's talkin' that mess 'cause he's garbage
My trees rolled, beauty of the week is foreign
And my homie bought a yacht so we on it and drinks are pourin'
Hoes admire my clothes 'cause I got Louis features on 'em
Life just like a movie plus the special feature bonus
With bad bitches and good weed to keep us coughin'
Hard as a bed of nails, you a beast for sleepin' on 'em
Motherfucker, yeah
Ayo, I'm livin' the high life 
Fly clothes, good liquor, good weed  
Fine hoes, those are things I'ma need  
We make these ladies pants wet when we grab the mic 
And we gon' have 'em like  or die, I see you, nigga)
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la , la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la, ayy
Sit back, relax and move slow 
We're now in cruise control
I got these motherfuckers hatin' on the way the boy live
Angry at the way they ladies always say that I'm the shit
People stay up on my dick, I ain't worried 'bout them
I'm too focused on the money, I ain't worried 'bout friends
They say the youngin' dream like a king 
I'm Muhammad Ali in the ring, Christmas Eve in the spring 
Way above the bar, but I ain't twenty-one
Wizzle cuttin' up 'cause I stay puffin' blunts
And when the money come , I'ma give it back 
Got a driver who addresses me as Mr. Mac 
Dealin' with these diva hoes , they so demanding 
Mac a young superstar , Dakota Fanning 
You know I'm planning for the world to be mine
No blind dates, but I'm gettin' girls from behind
The type of shine, stay turnin' 'em blind
Just cruisin', smokin' purp, and recline 
Ayo, I'm livin' the high life
Fly clothes, good liquor, good weed 
Fine hoes, those are things I'ma need 
We make these ladies pants wet when we grab the mic
And we gon' have 'em like 
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la, ayy
Sit back, relax and move slow 
We're now in cruise controlI wrote this under the influence of narcotics
Yeah
Play them horns!
Young raspy god
Yeah, um
Why you fuckin' up my good mood?
The Bimmer used but it look new
Your raps dry as overcooked food
My shit is kaboom
I took shrooms, now I'm playin' dodgeball in a crooked room
So address me as your superior
Mind on delirium, ice-cold interior
Stirrin' up the chaos, I'm the cause of the confusion
Young, grown-ass nuisance with the strength of 22 men
Pukin' all over your brand new accoutrements
Lucrative, assassin them, shoot to miss
I turn my body into Eucharist
Nail me to a crucifix
If I'm gonna kill myself, then I'ma do it big
Scalin' Mount Vesuvius
We don't even know what bein' human is
And what's a man when he lose his wits?
Useless as the news at six
Foolish, we nothin' but a bunch of rotten and stupid kids
I wanna , I wanna punch you 
I wanna , wanna, I wa—, I wanna punch you 
I wanna, I wanna punch you in your fuckin' face 
Hahaha , yeah
You live inside a computer
In 2014, religion turn to rumor
Maneuver through the world in a Uber
Born to be a loser to the world, I'm just a tumor they'll remove
If I would've done my schoolwork
I could've been a Oklahoma Sooner with a golden retriever I named Cooper
Work part-time at Bruegger's
Workin' on securin' me a future, the American dream
Big titty bitches guaranteed a spot on the team
Bust inside my pants, leave a spot on my jeans
Clean it up
Why are pretty girls always mean to us?
I'm the Godzilla of mess
Leave my house forgettin' that I'm still in a dress
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Blam, blam, blam, blam, blam, blam, blam
Gun sounds, gun sounds
I wanna , I wanna punch you 
I wanna , wanna, I wa—, I wanna punch you 
I wanna, I wanna punch you in your fuckin' face 
Hahaha , yeah
I wanna , I wanna punch you 
I wanna , wanna, I wa—, I wanna punch you 
I wanna, I wanna punch you in your fuckin' face 
Hahaha 
I'm worldwide, but I smack clowns local
Gunshots, M.O.P. background vocals
Fire in the hole of the designer of your clothes
On the up and up, you fuckin' up, why you fuckin' with those?
Planet of the apes, the survival of the goons
I'm so dope, you could put the lighter on the spoon
I'm tightest with the tunes, need a verse and I write it, son
Master shit with no practice, bitch, Al Iverson
Fuck the king of New York, in my presence they all peasants
The king is all talk
Whoever holdin' the crown
Better pass that shit to me, P, I'm holdin' it down
Fuck if you the greatest
A lot of rappers got killed, fuck around and be the latest
Your bars warm, my shit smokin'
I pitch Knicks at my pace, I'm Chris Copeland
Yeah
I wanna , I wanna punch you 
I wanna , wanna, I wa—, I wanna punch you 
I wanna, I wanna punch you in your fuckin' face 
Hahaha , yeah
I wanna , I wanna punch you 
I wanna , wanna, I wa—, I wanna punch you 
I wanna, I wanna punch you in your fuckin' face 
Hahaha , yeahSaid, a place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times, I once contemplated suicide
I would've tried, but when I held that 9
All I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside of misery and poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I've survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't got a choice but to roll on
We finally find a spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trickness
A spot where we can smoke in peace
Even though we G's, we still visualize places we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eyes, see this place where players go and pass it
Got a spot for us all, we can ball at thug's mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothin' but peace and love
Street passion, every ghetto needs a thug's mansion
Thug's mansion, oh, oh
Nothin' but peace and love
Street passion, ghetto needs a thug's mansion
Sometimes I see the world for how messed up it really is
Tell myself I'll be the one to make a change in it
I could die tonight, not make it to the sunrise
But then I wouldn't heal the pain in it
I'm gettin' high to forget about the lows though
Get a paycheck, spend it all on Polo
Designer brands cover up my insecurities
Personally I ain't nothin' but an average Joe though
And now I'm dressin' so expensive for no reason
Cold world we livin' in, it's below freezin'
I got some fam who can't afford a coat
So I leave a little paper there before I go
I spend a thousand on a hotel, they poor and broke
It make me wonder who I'm prayin' to before the show
This a letter to whoever, I'm just hopin' that you see
Remember love and remember me
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothin' but peace and love
Street passion, every ghetto needs a thug's mansion
Thug's mansion, oh, oh
Nothin' but peace and love
Street passion, every ghetto needs a thug's mansionWhat do you do? 
In April, I open my bill 
In May﻿, I sing night and day 
In June, I change my tune 
In July, far far I fly 
In August, away 
Yup 
Welcome 
Have a seat 
Uh, I'm still trapped inside my head, it kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm livin' paradise, with what I have to worry 'bout?
Dealin' with these demons, feel the pressure, find the perfect style
Makin' sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form
Difference between love and war inform me, I'm above the norm
Give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, bath salts
Rhymin' like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed
Still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music 'gainst my life, I think I fear the choice
I don't know what I'm runnin' from, but I'm runnin' still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothin' real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mil wouldn't make me sign a fuckin' deal
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil
I want that Rolls-Royce that the homie Lennon drove 
So if they don't got some dollars for me, I'ma send 'em home
Unconventional, special, but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's lettin' me meet these centerfolds 
Troubles fill my mind capacity, I let 'em go 
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow 
That's just me all wildin' out and bein' extra though 
Meezy, nigga, let 'em know 
Here we go 
Uh 
Uh 
And if God was a human, it'd be yours truly
Watchin' horror movies with some foreign groupies, thinkin' this decor suits me
Uh, I do drugs to get more loopy
I'm in tune to ancient jujitsu spirituals, it's blissful 
Lookin' out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet 
I think I'm JFK's final speech 
Try assassinatin' all of my beliefs 
I'm asleep, so whisper to me for the peace of mind
And he be high, some weed to grind on top of Jesus shrine
Twenty thousand on my watch 'cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine 
Can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now, it's just not the same 
Lookin' out the window, ashin' on the pane 
I wonder if I lost my way This one goes out to ya girl

Catch a early flight, hit another city
For a concert full of fans who be fuckin' with me
Countin' hundreds, fifties, groupie hoes

Two at once, that's a ménage à trois
Watch their bras come off, have me sayin', "La-di-da"
Rock 'n' roll, livin' life
Gettin' head, get it twice
It feels like I've been drunk for the eleventh night
Don't know how I'm gonna wake up in time to catch this flight
All these bitches in the front row tryna dress alike
They do a lot of barkin', but they never bite
They lookin' at me like, "I'm gonna have some sex tonight"
And yes, I might if it's alright, 'cause...
I got what you need If you lookin' for a trip
Escape the world a little bit, maybe go and get a grip

I'm on my job, but maybe out my mind
Got some liquor and some weed, it's about that time
Anyway you name it, I'm entertainment
I make it, I'll admit, I'm kinda famous
My life is like a vacation
'Cause day out and day in, these hotels, Days Inns
Travel navigation, I switch up my location
Days goin' without shavin', the road life's a bitch
But fuck it, this the good life, so for no life, I'd switch
Got my money comin' faster than these women I get into
Can't tell me how to live my life, chill, fool, I been cool
I'm the type of dude, pretty cool, kinda nice, not rude
'Cause some hoes who like my tunes
Get front row then show their boobs
Party every night, they worry that I blow the fuse
But I'm way too young, and don't know rules 
I got what you need If you lookin' for a trip
Escape the world a little bit, maybe go and get a grip
This heart can be your drugs, just please don't take too much

That party last night, I don't remember, I'm so hungover 
We stayed up drinkin', twist an ounce as the girls come over
Drink my OE, smoke my bud, sluts know I'm just tryin' to fuck
So let's get drunk until we gone
Everybody chug your beer when the hook come on
I love high school 
Ditchin' class 
Gettin' fucked up, nuttin' in the bitch with the thickest ass
I wanna go to Dice for the rest of my life
No, not really, but it might be nice
Early wakin' up, never could I sleep in
Can't remember what I did last weekend 
A whole lot of drinkin', a whole lot of cheifin'
A whole lot of parties, and some is only decent
So we gettin' drunk, we don't give a fuck 
Told the topless sluts, "Keep on fillin' up my cups" 
The cups was red, posted up on the bed
You might get fucked, or you might just get some head
It's whatever with me, get some head, light the weed
That's just the motherfuckin' kind of night that I need 
That party last night, I don't remember, I'm so hungover
We stayed up drinkin', twist an ounce as the girls come over
Drink my OE, smoke my bud, sluts know I'm just tryin' to fuck

Everybody chug your beer when the hook come on
I love high school
Ditchin' class
Gettin' fucked up, nuttin' in the bitch with the thickest ass 
Uh, I can't tell you 'bout goin' to class

Blowin' out birthday candles on the weed cake
Somethin' to smoke in, somethin' to sell
Been gettin' fucked up before I was even twelve, uh
Ten blunts, get the keg pump
Fillin' up a red cup 'til I'm so drunk I can't stand up
We party hard 'til the cops get us surrounded
The dude throwin' the party, he probably got grounded 
See, in high school everybody wanna grow up
You know what? Bein' old seem so butt that I don't think I need that
I'ma be a kid like Will Ferrell in Step Brothers, but with a crib
My brother gettin' older, out of college is the shit
But for right now, I'ma just visit, haha

If you in high school, you remember when you was in high school, man

Everybody chug your beer when the hook come on
I love high school 
Ditchin' class 
Gettin' fucked up, nuttin' in the bitch with the thickest ass
East End Empire
This has been your host of the party, Mac Miller
Haha"I'd say there was as much dope in the music business as there is in virtually any other business now. The dope is so out in the open that you can go anywhere, and it's there. So there's no, sort of, underground movement of people taking dope, you know? The most extraordinary, straight people are taking dope. It's available anywhere, at any time, and it's all over the place. If you want it, you can have it, you know?"
Alright then, bitch
Ha, ya
Uh
A million ma'fuckin' fans on that ass, biotch! 
Feels amazin'
Ladies and gentlemen, I've always been the same kid )
Now I'm famous 
Hey

Now these girls all tryna suck my dick, I rap, haha
I may let her if I'm sippin' that yak, yeah
Too fly, submarine in the sky
Can't go out in public, I better get a disguise
It's better to be yourself, don't ever just live a lie
While I'm drivin' with the top down, listenin' to Plies 
Chicken wings and fries, I'm in love with all the simple things
Little things, hoes just be around, always bickering
I got some money, threw some diamonds on a pinky ring
That's why your favorite girl probably on my ding-a-ling
Chief blunts with Peanut, standin' on a tree stump
Rappers need to keep up, my bitch is double D cup
She fucks, but she ain't no slut, and she know that 
She freeze up, livin' in the moment, get her Kodak 
Hold that, wait for it to flash, get the picture

Bus around the country, but I'm travelin' the world
With all these rappers that be hatin' like I'm battlin' with girls

All these rappers brag, but I don't ever see 'em close

'Cause I don't give a fuck what y'all think
And I don't give a fuck what that dude on that blog think

So give it up to Swag Swag-man-doo on the saxophone
And let me do my thing
Uh, hey

I got a mansion in the Hills and that's my neighborhood
An empty spot up on the shelf I need a vase to put, there
A couple wooden chairs, that be lookin' good, yeah
And, baby, if you want, I'll wait for you
We can sit inside my crib and watch a pay-per-view
'Cause I just need you next to me, keep you my accessory
I just wanna sing you your new favorite tune
And it goes a little somethin' like this
Tonight a opportunity that you might miss
I just wanna get you feelin' right like this
Then end the night with that goodnight kiss, bliss
That pretty girl standin' by my side
She down to ride, yeah 
I can love you just how you like
Take a breath of my air
Don't be scared, don't be scared
Don't be scared, don't be scared
I love to lick your pussy 'cause it tastes so good
And I could read your face like it's my favorite book
You look like Rihanna mixed with Meagan Good, huh
She a good fuck, always give me good love
Baby, I just wanna hold you tight
You tell me that I'm trippin' and I know you right
You feel just like a swimmin' pool, let me dive right into you
Stay there for a while 'cause I know it's nice
You cold as ice with a heart like August
Throw some Wu-Tang on, you like, "Ah, shit"
Baby, I like it raw with
That rug burn, we be fuckin' on the carpet
My little nasty girl, but she a businesswoman
No tellin' what she'll do, but she be in the moment
Lay it down, I'd like it if you stayed around
So, saxophone man, can you play me out?
That pretty girl standin' by my side
She down to ride, yeah
I can love you just how you like
Take a breath of my air
Don't be scared, don't be scared
Don't be scared, don't be scared I think I'm in love
And I don't really know what love is
I think I'm in love
'Cause I be going crazy off one kiss
I think I'm in love
She probably ain't in love with me
I think I'm in love
So I guess we'll have to see
Uh, look
There's just somethin' 'bout her caramel skin
And how that chest look in every single bra she in 
That got me with her every single day out the week 
We don't even hit the streets, we just stay in the sheets 
Those brown eyes got me trapped
Kiss her on her stomach when she lie on her back 
She got class, cry and she laugh
A dime with a ass, drinking wine by the glass 
No other girl can make me hers
It's whoever wanna take me first
And she grabbed me, wouldn't let me go
Usually your heart like an Eskimo: cold
But she said there's something about me
That she don't want no loving without me
Skin so soft like I'm touching some downy
Girl, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
And I don't really know what love is 
I think I'm in love
'Cause I be going crazy off one kiss 
I think I'm in love
She probably ain't in love with me 
I think I'm in love
So I guess we'll have to see
Look
Check my phone, always text me when she wake up
Sex is real great, always messing up her makeup 
No clothes on, lovin' to a slow song
Everybody telling us this thing we have is so wrong
And she don't care whatever goes on
Plus she's best friends with my mom 
Keep a journal, y'all know the story, though
The superficial type, love her horoscopes
And I'm a Capricorn that she ain't never had before 
Her ex hates me 'cause he ain't me, and that's for sure 
She got this look she give that send 'em runnin'
She so stunnin', got my heart jumpin'
And my mind is all twisted
Her lips is delicious for kisses
I got her heart on my wish list
Manager: give her the business 
I think I'm in love
And I don't really know what love is
I think I'm in love 
'Cause I be going crazy off one kiss
I think I'm in love 
She probably ain't in love with me 
I think I'm in love
So I guess we'll have to see
So this bitch
Really hit me like, "How did you get so lucky?"
You know what I said? I said
"Bitch, how did you get so lucky?
The fuck you think this is"
Ayy, I treat my ladies right
And that's for damn sureYeah, right here, or no, never mind
Pete Rock
Yeah
My cigarillo bigger than armadillos
I might go Schizo, pistol under the pillow
Abysmal, flow hot as fire and brimstone
Sonning these rappers, calling them kiddo, it's simple
I'm watching movies with the sound off
In the dark my shadow colder than a groundhog's
So I'm eating Chinese food with the brown sauce
Fuck bitches, nothing but a hound dog
Count off to a million, do you have time?
Blast off when you lifted, have you been this high?
Drifting by, give time a kiss goodbye
Cuz I'm gone, I'll be back as soon as pigs can fly
I'm the first time Peyton, let the pigskin fly
It is I, now that's Tony lifting
My shit is addicting, aliens are listening
Listen to this
Why won't you let the rain clouds melt?
Let the rain clouds melt
Everybody let the rain clouds melt
Why don't you let the rain clouds melt?
Back with Mac, yeah we mackin' right
Court-side looking brain-fried
Black and white guy, tie dye
Two hoes, tight thighs, no rolls on the ta-ta's
Pre-roll's in my Prada, neck gold, I'm your fa-sha
Son niggas, I'm the one, here I come
Where your tongue came from?
The underground like we platinum
Start the car with my right thumb
See me in the ride, Backwood burnin'
Get green, smoke earnin'
So high, spitting on the sky, the extraterrestrial's have arrived
Passports, we fly by, no court time
Throw the peace sign, by the Chevy as a Nissan
Now you acting like a pussy
Furtherize the level that we took 'em
Bent my dick in your mouth, I'll hush 'em
Why won't you let the rain clouds melt?
Let the rain clouds melt
Everybody let the rain clouds melt
Why don't you let the rain clouds melt?
Take you back with medieval, cerebral, assault retrieval
If you're trying to get down, better call your people
Flow like you're walking down a Harlem needle
Sharp as steeples, this is an assault on evil
An assault on evil
Said this is an assault on evil
So get on the mother fucking ground!Get some brand new kicks, couple hundred on the jeans
I been spendin' all this money, got me feelin' like a G
Hand-me-down gear, this some shit you never seen
Droppin' three stacks, now I'm so fresh, so clean

All the shit me and my team does
Girls see me like, "Damn, you look good, now you cleaned up"
Feelin' fresh, got my teeth brushed

Been feelin' like a true pimp, biatch
It's '05, I'm the Steelers, you the Seahawks
This weed I keep hittin' makin' me cough
The jolly giant, I'm Jack, smokin' the Beanstalk
I get hoes in boat shoes, style, I won't lose
Welcome to the old school, bitch
Now my clothes look cleaner, and my kicks look flyer
We be buyin' more reefer, so my crew gettin' high
Now the girls keep callin', and the money keep comin'
I be jumpin' off the bridge, but I'ma hit the ground runnin'
When the fuck will I wake up? 
I ask 'em, when the fuck will I wake up? 
'Cause every single day, somethin' new to do
So I'ma keep on dreamin', hit snooze 
Hit snooze, I ain't tryna wake up yet
I'ma keep on dreamin', be the straight-up best
And I'm blessed, everyday I'm gettin' straight-up fresh
My homies like, "Mac, damn, you get your cake up"
Yes, I did, that's the life I live, I grind all day
High school, sellin' mixtapes in the hallway
I bet they never thought I'd be this cool
Now they understand why I skip school
Had my dreams, wasn't worried at all
That's why if I'm gettin' bored, I go splurge at the mall
I got money , I got bitches 
I got everything they dreamin' of, and I ain't done shit yet
This major leagues, big business
Used to have a wish list, now I just give gifts
Shit, it make me happy
Here's how to reach me, you can get at me
Now my clothes look cleaner, and my kicks look flyer
We be buyin' more reefer, so my crew gettin' high
Now the girls keep callin', and the money keep comin'
I be jumpin' off the bridge, but I'ma hit the ground runnin'
When the fuck will I wake up? 
I ask 'em, when the fuck will I wake up? 
'Cause every single day, somethin' new to do
So I'ma keep on dreamin', hit snooze 
When the fuck will I wake up? 
I ask 'em, when the fuck will I wake up? 
'Cause every single day, somethin' new to do
So I'ma keep on dreamin', hit snooze 
Now my clothes look cleaner, and my kicks look flyer
We be buyin' more reefer, so my crew gettin' high
Now the girls keep callin', and the money keep comin'
I be jumpin' off the bridge, but I'ma hit the ground runnin'
When the fuck will I wake up? 
I ask 'em, when the fuck will I wake up? 
'Cause every single day, somethin' new to do
So I'ma keep on dreamin', hit snooze *Coughing*
Damn
Aight, uh
Smokin' on this purple got my mind all hazy
But it never put my grind on lazy
I just wanna get my shine on, baby
I know it drive you crazy that my grind's on daily
'Cause I be gettin' blowed every day of the week
This haze got me so cheifed that I stay in my seat
You wanna get me to spit, just play me a beat
I strive to win in everything 'cause i hate the defeat
So I elevate my mind 
Gotta stay cheifin'
And I don't even rap, boy, this just the haze speakin' 
My room bangs and it got the rays tweakin'
Smokin' blunts of haze, i just watch the day leavin'
With L's around the circle, you can tell that this some purple
'Cause this dank is so potent, If you smell it, it'll hurt you
I smoke that fruity with the funkiest fumes: Pepi Le Pew
Got a little skunk in the room, now chill
Lay back, meditate 
I'm floatin', feelin' lighter than a featherweight 
My body asleep, but my head awake
I dedicate the rest of my night to makin' hella cake 
Pardon the lingo, it's prolly this Cali
The addiction and the plague got me wantin' it badly
I chase money like a hard to get female
Then throw it back up in the water like a seashell
Sitting in the silent twilight
The purple half light of the twilight
Wrap the night around me 
Blanket of black on my back 
I feel safe in the darkness 
I get blowed then melt into the chair
Blow a L up in the air, eyes is red, but I don't care 
Right now I prolly shouldn't be spittin' 
'Cause I'm lifted and mixin' up my diction
I'm feelin' high like the top of a water tower
Cop a sour then it's gone in a hour
Heavily medicated, sedated and faded 
Relaxed, chasin' an oasis
I'm in a safe haven , free from any trouble
Stumble, damn, this kush got me seein' double 
Need not fumble
Gotta keep my head straight
'Cause I stay puttin' haters in the checkmate 
Uh-huh, now I'm way past blowed
Purple weed got me feelin' on my own
Ain't nothin' like a purp high, the type to make a nerd high
It got me coughin' up a lung like it's my first time
Metaphors and similes from Ecuador to Italy
Back in fifth grade when I lost my weed virginity
Smokin' like a chimney, blowin' out a cloud
This purple, last kush stay stinkin' up my house
Sitting in the silent twilight 
The purple half light of the twilight 
Wrap the night around me
Blanket of black on my back
I feel safe in the darkness 
Blanket of black on my back 
I feel safe in the darkness
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, hahaWhoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Hope I got enough oxygen for this
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's uh, let's see
Whoa
How do it feel when you make it?
Is every day just another vacation?
Livin' needs no reason, just like seasons, they keep changin'
Have you seen the people's faces when you take away their pain?
That shit is prettier than any picture Monet could've painted
I, swear to God I never could've saw this happenin'
You was, you was rappin' and your mind started unravellin'
You back again with complications, that was then, this is now
You was on your way out, you stayed up and turned that shit around
Pittsburgh is a little town, you made it out of 
Look at all these things you did, are you not proud of
What you accomplished?
Was success everything that you wanted?
Are you bein' honest with yourself? 
How you doin'? How's your health? 
Well, I'm fine 
I left the past behind 
I'm only an architect, the world is just design
I don't mind all of the rumors, I'm just fine bein' a loser
Sit behind my own computer
It's divine, it's Hallelujah on my mind 
You need to let it all play out
The world is tryna hold you back, you found another way out
See the signs 
'Cause they're right in front your face
You got the light inside you, please don't let it go to waste 
Don't waste your time here
You don't got time to lose
Walk along the chosen road
On your own
Please free your mind here
You got a mind to lose

I can't sleep without pills 
Will it all go wrong? 
What'd you visualize every single time that you made them songs? 
Can you just hold on? 
Yeah
Havin' nightmares from the bottom 
Heaven is for legends, Hell is Hell for the forgotten 
I've been dealin' with some problems, I've been longin' for your love 
Crazy, selfish, doin' drugs 
Check off all of the above, yeah 
They told me, "Get it together, 'cause God is waitin' for you" 
Your life will never be normal, I got some paper for you 
Just respect who you are, or they gonna take that from you 
Everybody gotta die, that shit just make you mortal
Don't waste your time here 
Walk along the chosen road
Walk along the chosen road, yeah

Here we go!
I fuck around with them playmates 
20 thousand my day rate 
Eating seven course meals now
People say that I gained weight 
All you rappers you ain’t safe, more money, same face
Been the shit, still the shit
Just double up, exchange rate 
Guess who just grown up now? 
Dockin' up, sit the fuck down 
Had to speak to P, said I need a beat
To show these clowns I don’t fuck around 
Asking me about money 
Wonder what’s my net worth 
People try to come sue me
But I call up J.G. Wentworth 
I glow, they don’t 
I suppose that I'm dope 
Spend 10 racks on my coat 
Fuck a whip just bought me a boat 
My flow  is gross 
Used to be bread , now it's toast
Want that one? You reaching
You ain't close , no 
Oh you ain’t know? 
Since I was born 
My mind was gone 
Know I was poor, girl, my mind made me rich
I just go 
And my wrist was cold 
My world was snow 
What I need light for? 
Girl, I’m bright as a bitch, I just glow 
I’m so special 
I’m so special 
I’m so special 
Girl, I’m bright as a bitch, I just glow 
I’m so special 
I’m so special 
I’m so special 
Girl, I’m bright as a bitch, I just glow
I rap a lot , rap a lot 
Don’t be afraid, it’s just aftershock
That jam like when Shaq grab the rock
I’m going in like a Magic shot
Your raps sweet like apricots
Shut the fuck up, you don’t have to talk
I’ma lay back with my ass on top
Got the game on Master Lock, motherfucker 
You don’t see cash a lot
Bitch, stop acting like you bad; you not
I put my dick in her ass and twat
She look back, like, "That's the spot" 
Homie, I’m counting money
Play around with money 
Y’all ain’t shit without your money 
Life ain't all about the money
Well, it kinda is if you out of money 
Mac Millions, that’s the name
Most Dope, that’s the gang 
Drunk bitch, so glad she came
Saw her taking off her clothes, tryin' have a train 
Hoes love us, tryna fuck us, with no rubbers
Fuck that, we fuck make 'em each other
On tour, we make her fuck the runner, motherfucker
Just the shit that you need 
You ain’t fucking 'round with my team 
'Cause we living all of your dreams
Here to kill your self-esteem 
And my flow, that's pyro
Smoking blunts 'til my eyes close 
Middle finger up high, though 
End the song on a high note
Oh you ain’t know? 
Since I was born 
My mind was gone 
Know I was poor, girl, my mind made me rich
I just go 
And my wrist was cold 
My world was snow 
What I need light for? 
Girl, I’m bright as a bitch, I just glow

Bitch, that Pink Slime
Motherfuckerrrrrrr!
Ah!Aight, John Record, Easy Mac
Ill Spoken collectin' lines
Yeah, ha
 When we reminisce
 When we reminisce
 When we reminisce
Let the smoke signal guide you back home like Indians
And lend a spliff, and bullshit with my kinsmen
The Yuengling coolin' me down from the heat on the streets 
Take me back to those times of peace
Let me see those leaves turn at Frick, and kick flows, that's sick
And think back to chicks who loved my magic stick
When you look back, Malcolm 
Never forget, never regret the outcome
Never tear or spend a year askin', "How come?"
Lookin' for love, 'cause you found some
Never let a dime infiltrate your mind
She has no right questionin' McCormick design
Never quest for beef, always be cordial in rhymes
Never bored with your time on this planet Earth
Take a nap, take a snap, but when you take it for granted, it hurts
Try to be thrifty, so you manage your worth
Expect the best but plan for the worst
Never take advice from those who never question themselves
But your mental health should never be menaced by doubt
MM, I'm your MC Mentor
There for sure when things go south
I'm out, en route to beat back the nookie 
She says she loves me, what she want, half a cookie?
Never contemplate life when you're higher than giraffe pussy
Met Rec, the rest is history 
'Cause him and me, well, we hit the weed in-between the misery
We spit for free, we had dreams of gettin' cream
But things don't always go exactly how they seem
The big kids, they talkin' 'bout they big guns
But I just chill, lay back, hear the kick drum
Boom kak, boom-ba-boom kak
Around and back, now I'm gettin' off track
And I saw rap as a way to get away
From everybody tellin' me today is not my day
My day, my week, my month, my year, my tears
Held back, confronted by my fears
This endless intelligence, my mind can expand
As high as I am, chill, I'll be fine with a gram 
'Cause I'll be bumpin' through the speaker box, tryna bust a flow
At first an outcast lookin' for the love below
But don't mistake my terminology for philosophy
Screamin' 'til I get what I want, like a toddler be
Urban mythology, the words of the prophecy
The prodigy, see deep inside your mind like psychology
Taught to be verbal, passin' purple in the circle like we pass a word
Savor the mind but you 
Attack  happens fast and your ass'll swerve
Got a question, ask it first
Pass the purp and mash the verse
Let the smoke signal guide you back home like Indians 
And lend a spliff, and bullshit with my kinsmen
The Yuengling coolin' me down from the heat on the streets
Take me back to those times of peace 
Let me see those leaves turn at Frick, and kick flows, that's sick
And think back to chicks who loved my magic stick
Let the smoke signal guide you back home like Indians
And lend a spliff, and bullshit with my kinsmen
The Yuengling coolin' me down from the heat on the streets
Take me back to those times of peace
Let me see those leaves turn at Frick, and kick flows, that's sick
And think back to chicks who loved my magic stick
Yeah, Pittsburgh
I like that
Ha, yeahBaby boy, what's on your mind?

Do I know? But please remind me
Why you never wanna talk to me?

Okay, I take your clothes off, your body so soft
I give it to you real, it's no drama, ain't a soap opera
Whisper in your ear a little bit, but never too much
It's on the hush, I'd rather tell you with the way that I touch
You, every inch of your skin
My fingertips are dancin' with you, you my ballerina
You do a split, I split the difference
Yeah, you love to talk, I love to listen
And girl, it's a promotion every time we change positions
Okay, I'm swimmin' inside your linen like it's a ocean
Let me mix you a potion
Let me shake the walls, put this in motion
Let me get you goin'
My ears is open when you speakin'
Yeah, we playin' hookie, stay in bed, but we ain't sleepin'
Ain't a need for leavin' ever
Time is relative, we spend it more than you can measure
Nothin' better, let me help relieve the pressure
This is pleasure
The whole universe align and everything will come together
If you let her
You show me with your

You may be at the game, I guarantee you we in different seats
I seen you in the nosebleeds, but where I'm at, that isn't cheap
In the Benz, in a Jeep, make a million in a week
Takin' off her clothes 'fore I begin to speak like, "Gimme cheeks"
Been to London, been to France, go there if you get the chance
Been to Amsterdam, hit the club, hell no, I didn't dance
Rolled around a little, smoked the weed, seen the red lights
Ain't fuck a prostitute but the head nice, get right
From here on to the next life, relax and sip that Red Stripe
Way I spend this money, you would think I had a ex-wife
Bitches love the lead pipe, the 'Burgh, word to Ken Rice
New place every day, what I would give to just have 10 nights
Yeah, right, 'bout to drop an album, hope to blow your mind
Tryna reach a level where no music is put over mine
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D

Prolly off some molly, got me turnin' into polygons
On and on, DJ's puttin' on my song
People say I talk too long, killin' every single track the God is on
They cheerin' with their pom-poms, buyin' what I got on
Straight gold, find me fuckin' Silver with my Long John
Tom Tom, direct me to that money please
Square sponge, fuckin' dumb, yeah, your grades is under C
And I know, "In God we trust," but how much do they trust in me?
Enough to be a fuckin' beast on beats, yeah

You fuck your hand, askin', "How much money can I fit into this rubberband?"
Hustlin', throw your ass right inside a rubbish can
Excuse my French, that's just how I'd talk if I was Russell Brand
Know that I'm the fuckin' man, play my shit for three days
"All I make is hits, call me T-Pain!"
Sicker than if she gave me AIDS, plus some teeth decay
Then she stole my condom, try to auction it on eBay
Talk a little shit, man, probably thought he dissed me
Bitch, please, I just ate out Monica Lewinsky
Yeah, I taught her 'bout some slaughter, had her cryin' 'bout her father
Then I busted in her face while she told me, "It's an honor"
Bob O'Connor, we just politickin', finger-lickin' on my chicken
Got a way with words, words, words, word to Charles Dickens

In a daydream, livin' while these minutes pass me by
Lean back and hang these Nikes out the ride, just

My brain, it ain't attached, you love me? It's a little late for that
They gave my crazy ass a label, everything is rated X
I'm far beyond divorced middle-aged men who pay for sex
I work like I ain't made it yet, deserve this motherfuckin' paper
Get a Kit-Kat, break it in half, save one for later
Death to any traitor, that's a Benedict Arnold
I be wildin', goin' broke at international car shows
I'm a lawn mower, mad face get redder than a dog boner
Thank God I got sober, pot smoker, top roller, thought holder
Was a little kid until I got older
Wild since a child, pulled my file out of God's folder
Now let me talk slower, you can understand me now
We the originators, your style hand-me-down, yeah
They got me turnin' up, the amp is loud
The apocalypse is comin', so we campin' out at Granny's house
Dancin' with a bitch and pull her panties down, it's bush league
I love a little nature, addin' flavor to the pussy
People tend to overlook me and my agent overbook me

These bitches gettin' wet when I pull up in the Mercedes
Bitch, I be with Mr. T, I'm simply the fuckin' A-Team
Make dreams reality
Say "Hi" when you see me, my "Hello" is a formality

Hey yo I’m comin' to, comin' to, comin' to, comin' to
Comin' around again, runnin', runnin' around with them

Gettin' lifted, dazed and confused, controllin' this stick shift
I’ve been workin' hard baby, feelin' like it's my sixth shift
Dealin' with different situations, gettin' a bit of congratulations
Sick with the rhymes, splittin' your minds, feelin' the good vibrations!
Excitement, you see these different places I’m invited
While you’re writin', it's in the people’s ears, they callin' you Tyson
The nicest, you’ve seen in awhile
Believe it, the people the reason I'm out
They throwin' me love, and open me up
That’s why I see em' and greet em' with smiles
Shorty be lettin' me into her house
Pickin' her up and kickin' her down
They passin' me weed, relaxin' with me
They heard that the kid was the chillest around
Somewhere in Piffsburgh, kickin' it back watchin' the Steelers
Put your Reggie Bush away, we got some real herb
Shorty a weed ho, so nah I don't feel her
'Cause I’m just on to the next, don’t get your feelings hurt
Some days I be feelin' like I am the shit
Wearin' clothes right out the package lookin' how nice they fit

As long as I could stay up on my grind
I'mma always know where my home is
I’ve got a Piffsburgh state of mind!

Can't believe this what I'm drivin', can't believe this what I'm wearin'

Its who I like to be, you say I may be losing sight of things, and I might agree
But we livin in a digital world, you told me you wasn't a material girl
Then I realized those don't exist freedom of the mind thats the only bliss
And they told me no but I did it, ain't got shit for these bitches
Living life with no limits, days becoming so different
Get money fuck hoes, when your eatin your stomach grows
Whos that love to know ?
Makin music cause I love to, you hatin on me sayin fuck you
Its simple but it means a lot, this is what I do, I dont need to talk
Ya I tried to do a lot of things, couldn't focus on everything
I think im really good at many things, phones calling that's the devils ring
Im not gonna answer that phone, im ready to go back home
Been on this road for so long, that all I do is sit and make sad songs
What the fuck happend to that nice kid that you knew when he releasd that mixtape called KIDS
And everybody thought that he would be so big, till he lost focus cause he got so sick
Of all the bulshit that they always do, tell you what you gotta do
Everybodys watching you, you just wanna scream an Awprah
I think I need to see a doctor
(Keep it moving, Keep it moving you know I got stuff to say, when will the world fuckin realize
I got something to say, im not finished, I ain't scared of nothing, this my motherfucking time
And I'mma do this shit cause I was meant to do this motherfucking shit. Yeah motherfu shit yeah uh!
The funny thing, the funny thing is, this song isn't just a song because I just dreamed of this song
In past days and I woke up and it was the future, its funny when the future is things you dreamed
Because you never understand what they mean at that time but then at the forward of motion of
Seconds and minutes and hours you finally realized that they were all secret messages
From people you don't know but you might of seen them in a past life or the life in the future
Or whatever the fuck this whole thing is that you will never figure out SO STOP TRYING!Some people
Oh—woah—oh—oh
Oh—woah—oh—oh
Yeah
People say, people
People oh
Yeah, said
People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinkin' 'bout her all the time
I never seen somebody put together perfectly
What would I have to do to call you mine?
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes, or you can walk in blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear view
Let's leave it all in the rear view, girl
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry
Mend a broken heart, girl, if you can
I don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
And that responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm havin' some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
I ain't so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shootin' stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did I think I'm still myself
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear view
Let's leave it all in the rear view, girl

The wheels stay spinning on the Civic, boy, I'm always on the move
When you grinding all the time, there's a lot of shit to do
That's why I got Q, 'cause he keep me on the routine
I be too skeed, trying to kick it like Bruce Lee
Clean shoes, boy, new feet
And I'm never in the car with only two seats
I got a whip full of people, all fresh, call 'em 10 Deep
Motherfucker, we the future like next week
Young people don't see you as an equal
They just see you as deceitful, tryna send you back to preschool
You only gettin' one shot, no redo
Tell them haters keep they mouth shut, eat glue
Bitch, who the fuck you think you playing with?
I'm Justin Bieber meets Jadakiss
Here to take what's theirs, treat 'em all like Taylor Swift
Leave 'em in a daze, all like, "What day is it?"
Yeah, the boy got class, no Cambridge
Fresher than your man, girl, but whiter than a plate of grits
They keep wantin' more, I'm their favorite dish
This me, motherfucker, I ain't changing shit

If you tryna feel the vibes, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up

I got a brand new phone, rocking brand new clothes
Leaving every single party with a brand new ho
Yeah, I've done a little traveling, circling the globe
Always keep it moving, inertia on these hoes
Boy, I'm an asshole, girls call him a douchebag
This some old-school shit, but no boom bap
This ain't new swag, it's the same old me
The youngin get respect from the game's OGs
Cameras flashin' when we passin', so we stay low-key
Go to Mexico to party where the pesos be
On the turnpike, bitch, and your tank on E
With my head out the window screaming, "Get like me"
Ho, you should know the way I roll
Take a couple shots all to Superman these hoes
You ain't nothin' with your wack rap
Used to be the class clown, but now I get the last laugh
If you in the ride, turn the volume real high
If you tryna feel the vibes, throw your hands up in the sky
Motherfucker, get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up
Get 'em up, up, up, up, up, up

With a drink getting drunk, having one night flings
This is Pittsburgh, home of the six rings

You see that girl walk by, man?
Oof, she's somethin' else
I gotta say somethin', you know what I'm sayin'?
Uh, glance at her when she walkin' by
The type that never stop to talk to guys
She alone and you not surprised
'Cause she ain't fit for no other man
So you approach as a gentleman
Hello, ma'am, today you lookin' pretty damn elegant
I think she get the message like a telegram
I'ma be your cab or your yellow van
Tell me where, I'll take you where you wanna go
To the top, she perfect and she oughta know
When she walkin' by the studio
You can see my heart beatin' through my clothes
She ain't around, time movin' slow
I wanna be wherever you gon' go
And I wonder if she know my name
She shine like she ain't know what rain is
The game is the same as it was as some lame kids
You wanna hang with her every single day is funny
'Cause your friends say you whipped
Every late night you gotta go and dip
To pick her up and I've been sick of sluts
And this girl? She ain't gon' give it up
She want me puttin' in work like school
And I be smitten when she here, like a fool
But keep my cool, gotta be smooth
Eyes like Elmer, got me glued
These other dudes is not for you
I think Cupid musta shot you too
Girl, I just wanna talk to you
And I don't think you got a clue
When you around, it's so hard to move
So I wrote a couple bars for you
Girl, I just wanna talk to you
And I don't think you got a clue
When you around, it's so hard to move
So I had to write a couple bars for you

Locked eyes
It was rainin', she lookin' like sunshine
I told her we could have a fun time
Let me just take you out to lunch
I'm a really nice guy
I ain't gon' hurt you
I ain't even 'bout to flirt too
'Cause I'ma be straight up with you
And don't bring no make-up with you

Kick it at the crib
Every time we kiss, it tickle on my lips
I love the way that you lookin' at me
I just wanna see you lookin' happy
You grab me, pull me, tease me, fool me
Ain't gon' let me get it at the movies
Why you sittin' over a few seats?
Come and move closer to me
Uh, I hope you know that you got me
Here's my number, girl, you can call me
And if you guess it, don't stress
'Cause I ain't havin' no mess

I think about her all the time
And it's hard 'cause I'm on my grind
But I think I'ma call her mine
Girl, I just wanna talk to you
And I don't think you got a clue
When you around, it's so hard to move
So I wrote a couple bars for you

They wonder where I'm gon' be at
Posted with my chief sack
Seat back, keep this shit together like a knee cap
He's that bad motherfucker with a attitude
Haters try and play him, I ain't even gettin' mad at you
Fruity Judy spittin', but he rappin' like kiwi
I receive better than your satellite TV
Creepy, the rhymes that'll give 'em heebie-jeebies
Hoes showin' titties, tryna get a CD free
Please, grass stay together like it's welted
Turnin' down groupies, now they think I'm gettin' selfish
I'm not cocky, I'm just confident
Wave you off, move along, if you not convinced
Got way too much shit up on my shoppin' list
While you're broke, doin' coke, tryna copy Vince
Hop off the dick, let me be on my way
I don't pay attention, stay havin' good days, so
They think that I'ma lose my mind out here
Ask me where I think I'll be this time next year
But I don't care, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up
Said I don't care, I'm li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-livin' it up 
As I'm ridin' next to TreeJ , speedin' down the freeway
Headin' to the money, no pause, no delay
Racin' like a relay, hear me through the PA
Cheef 'til I'm sleepin', fuck the D-to-the-E-A
Uh, I'm in this game, no playin' for the pesos
Try and dip into this cheese like queso
Classes never seem to be there when they take role
I was runnin' to my dream, tryna make mo'
Music, make another song
They tell me they supported, they was hatin' all along
Love greater than the hate that I was gettin', didn't phase me for a second
So lately I've been gettin' kinda crazy, and I mention
To my lady when she stressin' that I'm cakin', it's a blessin'
I'm just tryna get her in the right direction
You want a war, then I'm comin' prepared
Most Dope, put ya thumb in the air, motherfucker
They think that I'ma lose my mind out here
Ask me where I think I'll be this time next year
But I don't care, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up
Said I don't care, I'm li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-livin' it up
"I think I'm having an overdose and so is my wife"
"Overdose of what?"
"Marijuana, I don't know if it had something in it, can you please send rescue?"
"Did you guys have fever or anything?"
"No I'm just, I think we're dying"
"How much did you guys have?"
"I don't know we made brownies..."
"And I think we're dead, time is going by really, really, really, really slow."Why thank you, Jerome, that was a very good speech
Next up we have our last candidate for the 2010 Allderdice High School presidential campaign
We have Mac Miller!
Haha, look
Comin' with the flows of a veteran, Mac for class president
All black Letterman, recognize a gentleman
Know anything but formal, take you out the normal
It's time travel here, step into my portal
Never seem to be another ordinary college fellow
Still keep a bunch of action figures, Donatello's
I used to wet my pants, leave the carpet yellow
Now I'm playin' games with hoes, turn they heart to jello
L's rolled from my wrist to my elbow
Hella smoke got my eyes red like Elmo
Music that I make got me buzzin' like a cellphone
Stickin' to my word, I'm Velcro, hell no
I ain't gon' stop one minute
Better than I ever been, before was just a scrimmage
Now the boy playin' for the cup, this the championship
See the wordplay dance from his lips
All my ladies put ya hands on ya hips, here some candy to lick
Come and holla if ya man is a bitch, haha
Every party that I roll to they demand me to spit
Treat me like I'm Peyton Manning in this
Playa, I don't got no time for the slow grind here in '09
Blow minds with these dope rhymes, call 'em coke lines
Snort it, get distorted, I'm takin' you out of orbit
Plus we poppin' champagne, see the cork twist
Purple piff got me higher than a forklift
Hungry, feedin' like my mother got four tits
I'm livin' in this music, you a tourist
Rocky and Bulwinkle, you just Boris
Boy spit still way sharper than a swordfish
Your whole style just dead like a morgue is
I'm a senior but I stay fresh, man
Class president, never woulda guessed, man
Bitches on me that I ain't never met, man
The only thing that's on ya dick is ya left hand

Oh, thank you, thank you Mac Miller, thank you
Hahaha, oh wow, oh, quite impressive
Quite impressive, Mac MillerYeah, Mac Miller, ayy 
You know the finer things in life, you know 
Sometimes you gotta kick back and enjoy that shit
Look, just relax  up) 
I like sittin' in shotgun, deuce on a L 
Parents not carin' 'cause they used to the smell
Classy-ass women, fresh-ass linen 
Hot summer days with a pool I can swim in 
A good spot to kick it , a case of 40's
Them homies always havin' good stories 
The beer bottles with the twist-off caps 
When old people tell you that they listen to rap
I love days I can sleep in , four day weekends 
Hoes puttin' they clothes back on, you peekin' 
Blunt rides, with a mixtape bumpin' 
I love makin' love in public
And when the hip-hop legend tour comin' to your town 
Findin' a crispy-ass twenty on the ground 
Walkin' when the sun out, watchin' Run's House 
Or action movies when the villain pull his gun out
The best things in life is the free ones
The little things, everybody need some 
The finer things make you feel better 
But no one ever seem to remember 
The best things in life is the free ones 
The little things, everybody need some 
The finer things make you feel better
But no one ever seem to remember 
I like sleepin' in class and cheatin' to pass 
Hoes walkin' in the halls and you reach for they ass 
Fast food lines when they movin' so quickly 
When your weed man hit you with some sticky
Street performers, warmin' up the corners
Sellin' by the ounce, then pinchin' by the quarter 
When some kicks on sale 
Wakin' up in the mornin' with a shitload of mail
The wake up, the bake up, chillin' while you face blunts
Goin' in blowed for your shape-up like, "Say what?" 
Blog put your tape up, get a good review
When dumbass people tell you what you shouldn't do 
When she rub my head while I'm between her knees, haha
Gettin' love from the people overseas 
Haters tryna hate, but they got nothin' to say 
It's just the little things that get me through the day 
The best things in life is the free ones 
The little things, everybody need some 
The finer things make you feel better 
But no one ever seem to remember
The best things in life is the free ones 
The little things, everybody need some 
The finer things make you feel better 
But no one ever seem to remember
Like I said before, it's your boy, Mac Miller

Uh, and it's the best day ever
Every now and again you gotta just
Just say somethin', somethin' real
'Cause, you know, you plan on changin' the world, that's—
When it's all said and done, it's more than just
More than just rap, it's deeper than that
The people think it's all about the fame
And the money and your status in the game
But it's deeper than all that
They just want the women and the cars
Gettin' high so they can chill with some stars
But it's deeper than all that
They thinkin' that it's all about the shows
And the chain hangin' down on your clothes
But it's deeper than all that
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believin' is all that
I got that money on my mind, the grind, and the ability
The knowledge and the know-how, stamina and the agility 
Soon as I step in the facility, these haters start testin' my civility
I'm tellin' ya, they killin' me 
Some of 'em feelin' me and some of 'em be grillin' me
But I just blow my kush smoke up to the ceilin', G 
Yeah, and take a toke of the Swisher smoke 
They got the paint and the brush, but not the picture, loc 
What is an emcee if he can't rap? 
Just a monkey with a mic just waitin' to get slapped 
And what is a DJ if he can't scratch? 
The one rotten apple that's spolin' the whole batch 
What is a B-Boy if he can't break? 
Might as well do the Dougie or even the Harlem Shake 
And what is a graffiti artist if he don't tag?
No homophobia, but he's a fag
'Cause it's deeper than all that
Some people think it's all about the fame
And the money and your status in the game
But it's deeper than all that
They just want the women and the cars
Gettin' high so they can chill with some stars
But it's deeper than all that
They thinkin' that it's all about the shows
And the chain hangin' down on your clothes
But it's deeper than all that
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believin' is all that 
One time for the world 'cause we do it for y'all
Bat logo light up in the sky when the studio call
Movin' the crowd, get 'em loud without a gimmick
Spit with a golden ticket, I'm whippin' it up in minutes
My feet up in this game, you haven't even made a divot
Worried 'bout the critics, what's happenin' now, forget it
From my heart is where I give it
Stay thinkin' 'bout the future
When I'm rich, I'ma call my mom before I call the movers
These haters just losers
Hate to see you winnin'
Gave my all from the beginnin'
I'm in it for extra innings
Here to change the world like I change clothes
Wouldn't mind a little bankroll, pesos
But I'm right here for way more
What is somebody if they can't love?
A hater, someone give 'em a hug, aha
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believin' is all that
The people think it's all about the fame
And the money and your status in the game
But it's deeper than all that
They just want the women and the cars
Gettin' high so they can chill with some stars
But it's deeper than all that
They thinkin' that it's all about the shows
And the chain hangin' down on your clothes
But it's deeper than all that
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believin' is all thatYeah

Welcome to the free mind
I pick you up from times that got you feelin' on a decline
Now we the giants, fee-fi
Just had to get some me time
Bitch, I ain't no average Joe, I'm motherfuckin' G.I
The weak spine can go to hell
I'm overwhelmed, can't even pick the car I wanna drive
Often times, we fear the disappointment from our father's eyes
Far cry to heaven, longer ride back home
Unconnect, a mind felon, never talk on phones
And fuck regret, we the legends when we hot or cold
I'm old-fashioned, very closed, and polka dot my soul, yeah
I made adjustments, I'm just gettin' started
Why the fuck I feel like brushin', like a sweep, or a snare roll?
How do I bear the weight to those I can't know?
Give light like a lamp post, and fix me up a ham roast
Everybody clap your hands for
The Wizard and the Tin Man, and the Lion and the Scarecrow
There he goes again, standing on his toes again
You are not alone, my friend
If this feels like home, why don't you come on in? )
Have that glass of wine, share some laughs to pass the time
There's snakes in the grass, there's snakes in the grass
Yeah
I hate the power she got over me
I'm Bukowski writin' poetry
Hold on to imaginary rosaries
Put away your own beliefs
Guess we ain't the same
But we all came from Mother Earth's ovaries
Rabid dog, show my teeth, eat a motherfucker whole
Chewin' on your crunchy bones, spit out your disgusting soul
Homie, we don't love them hoes
Yes, we do, but fuck 'em though
Tell the doctor that my medicine can probably up the dose
I'm not there, but fuckin' close
Oh my god, I'm fuckin' close
Bitch, you ain't no fuckin' judge
But this my blood, I'm under oath
Shit, I guess it's just the way it goes
Yeah, better go and smell the roses if you wanna tell the world about 'em
I'm in my imagination, there's a world around 'em
And when they hate, eliminate 'em like you never knew 'em
Save me from my execution
There he goes again, standing on his toes again
You are not alone, my friend

Nobody make you feel like you but 
And you don't know what you should do
You just looking for someone to make you move

Big or small, it's been my fault

Blind folded keep it going 'til we hit a wall
Yeah, I'm never going through the motions

We can only go up , we can only go up

Hey, I heard they got nice cars up in Heaven
Free liquor out the bar and the brightest fuckin' stars up in Heaven
Heard that you can chill, not worry 'bout the police
Not worry 'bout someone fightin' 'cause everything just at peace
Heard the streets paved with gold, the women all gorgeous
You just float, can't even feel where the floor is
I heard Heaven got a brand new venue
Next to that restaurant, you love their menu
And everything free, so everyone cool
Look out any window, it's an incredible view
Everyone you speak to always tellin' you the truth
And it's only good shit when you gettin' all your news
Ooh, ah, imagine that
Just a place that we can kick it, be happy at
Satisfaction or maybe I'm dreamin'
Tell you what it's like when I see it
If you hear what Heaven's like, can you tell me?
Please, I'm really tryin' to know
'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done
Shit, I'm just tryin' to go
If you hear what Heaven's like, could you tell me?
Please, I'm really tryin' to know
'Cause I do what I do, when it's all said and done
Shit, I'm just tryin' to go

Just kick it up there in Heaven 'cause nobody goin' change
Nobody can complain, the parties are all insane
The people all know your name, shit, you entertain
See everybody you want, always keepin' in touch
And go and chill by yourself when everything get too much
Never a fuckin' rush, you there for a million plus
You probably got a Mercedes, but always could take the bus
So fuck, that's what Heaven's like, I guess I think it is
Come to think of it, I've been drinkin' shit, I don't know the truth
This is what I imagined when I was standin' in the booth, haha

Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
I said, uh, I close my eyes before I cross the street
If a car about to hit me, then he ought to beep
Watchin' Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep
It's harder than it seems, I'm under water in my dreams
Yes, I’m in awe, jigsaw, puzzles not complete
I'm just an idea, nothin' concrete
I came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines
They tryna change with us, but come to the same difference
So, shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
I don't mind those hatin' on my style
Tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low
Said, I'm no god
I don't think that I'm a human though, 'cause I'm so odd
And people sellin' drugs, they can't find no job
If Christ made a million off of sellin' the cross
Okay, let bygones be bygones, mind strong as pythons
Day that I die on will turn me to an icon
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on
Best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan
Somebody do somethin' please

Somebody, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody

Sippin' Jameson
Like I was majored in whiskey flavorin'
When I'm drunk, I'll cut your head off, leave it danglin'
FlyLo's still tryna put me on to Ableton
Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me
Said, I ain't nobody, but neither are you
Contemplatin' if I even still believe in the truth
I'm so stubborn, I'd rather write my own history book
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
Hell nah
All your songs are sixteen's and a hook
We here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution
I'm down for this movement, tryin' not to lose it
Jewish Buddhist consumin' the views of Christianity
I wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in a igloo
Hear the fish bitin' nice right now
Can't figure out life and feel right right now
If I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it
Hands up in the air like this, right now, let's go
Somebody do somethin' please
Somebody do somethin' please
Somebody, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody

I said there ain't no party like aristocratic partyYeah, um, okay
Uh, I'm steppin’ out the flux capacitor
Go to Africa, then come back wearin' jackal fur 
This ain't a rap song, it’s a massacre
Only sacrificin' those who know to say the magic words
Stop, somebody get that man a pacifier
Y'all ain't shit but the appetizer 
I'm at a diner with a bad vagina, sippin' on some red wine
When I die, told her snort my ashes, that's a dead line
I'm doin’ just fine, control the suicidal thoughts
And when I’m runnin' out of time, then I’ma buy the clock 
Life's meaning tends to tie the open-minded knots
If it's all a game, I'm at the final boss 
You won’t stop us with a diamond cross
This type of demon crucifies the fake who try to floss
And if the rain is just the cryin' gods, then Utopia's behind the fog
See, my eyes wide shut, I'm layin' down in a field of roses
When sanity is at a distance, then we feel the closest
Society is all a joke
Turn the television on and see tomorrow's hoax
You'll fit the picture with a doctored pose 
Just be like everybody else and never walk alone 
I'm on the phone with the devil, speakin' monotone 
Gettin' bored with all these threats that he throwin' at me
Why are we so unhappy? Yeah
Why are we so unhappy? Yeah
Why are we so unhappy? Yeah
Yeah, why are we so unhappy?
Okay, okay
So can you tell the captain that his boat about to sink
And Mr. Drummond's wife is somewhere smokin' meth on the ship deck?
We livin' in a shipwreck, we nothin' but some insects
Obsessed with sex in this business givin' big checks 
Been ready to die until I realized I haven't lived yet
I haven't made an indent to the Lord we try to impress 
I just wish that I was fearless, bikin' down the mountain
Start to tremble as the gears switch 
So hear this, hear this, come bathe in my appearance 
When life give you a car, learn to steer it before you crash
There's more than cash and there's more than ass 
'Cause all those pleasures turn to torture fast 
And you can try to fight it but you never win 
They assemblin' the evidence to keep you from the truth and the lies 
We fall into the glamour like a cancer
The answer is there ain't a answer, bitch
Why are we so unhappy? Yeah
Why are we so unhappy? Yeah
Why are we so unhappy? Yeah
Why are we so unhappy?What?
Ah, Jerm
Ah, Jerm, you shouldn't have done 'em like this, man

Chillin' with the sour 'cause some smoke'll kill ya
I'm just mean, tryna cover all these magazines
And bitches tryna give me treats like it's Halloween
Lil' old school flavor when it's Jerm on the drums
Dodge the bullet points like it's words from a gun
Spittin' flames so they burnin' my tongue
Bitches wanna fuck, but they heard that I'm young
And they still do, I'ma stick around, call me mildew
Go and stay in Bel-Air like Uncle Phil do
Get rich, go and buy me a mansion
And get my parents a nice crib up in the Hamptons
The definition of cool: that's me, yo
Ask your girl about me, bet she know
I'm the future, you a fake, Miss Cleo
All my bitches bad like Shaq shootin' free throws

I'm the future, you a fake, Miss Cleo
All my bitches bad like Shaq shootin' free throws
Jet Set general, roll like a innertube
Drinking on tiger's blood: that's what winners do
It seems as if you'd like to hang from my genitals
Whoa, pause, oh gosh
It is I, the D to the I, with the two G's
Like it's Gucci attire
Why? Don't ask why, you so inquisitive
And the shoes I'm wearing are only limited
My bad, was that a bit much? A tad
Didn't mean to rap, that was low class
Pardon my rudeness, that was so crass
And I'm always making moves 'cause I never procrastinate
The number one spot is up for grabs, too late
What was that question you asked?
What's the definition of C-O-O-L?
If you haven't gotten it by now, ah, oh well
The definition of cool: that's me, yo

Let, let, let, let, let, let, let, let, let
Let, let, let, let, let, let

Let, let, let, let, let's get started
Nobody wanna be themselves, everyone's an artist
Walk around with a target on my head, take your best shot
Watch me do my thing, try and shoot me from the press box
We keep on goin' 'til they press stop
Errr-Errr, I'm breakin' records, so rewind
I left you scared, say a prayer, put it on the Holy Bible
Better hold a microphone like how a soldier hold a rifle
It's the Young Mac, I been there and done that
Went away, then come back with a motherfuckin' vengeance
I'm collectin', every sentence is impressive, learnin' lessons from the legends
Dreams is nightmares, so I fall asleep holdin' a weapon
Some people do this for attention
You can miss me with the bullshit, I gets busy with this music
Tell 'em, "Shut up," or "Get butt-fucked with a broomstick"
Been tourin' since before you were born, and I made the rules, bitch
Thou shalt not hold thy tongue
Don't quit, no goin' home until you done
Like train tracks or breakin' glass, you can hear me comin'
Motherfuckers better take off runnin'
Yeah
Danger, danger, this another banger
Feelin' like they know me, little homie, I'm a stranger
Moved out to the boonies, now I never deal with neighbors
No breaks, Speed Racer
I'm a Speed Racer 
I'm a Speed Racer 
Yeah
Well, it's a speed racer, cross-over knee breaker
Green maker, creator, hotter than the lines on the equator
Take your life and remake ya, all for the green paper
Write it all down but never got the time for eraser
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' song though
Drummin' on some big ol' titties, I'm playin' bongos
I put my long pole in the wrong hole
She say, "Get up out my stomach," I'm like, "Bitch, you know you love it"
I'm disgustin', mind start to wonder about this world we in
Then it's back on the phone, I'm fightin' with my girl again
Shit... I never been normal, as a youngin'
I was in black clothes, they close the portal on me
Talkin' shit but you foldin' more than origami
I'm fuckin' awesome, better run along and call your mommy
'Cause we droppin' bombs more than atom do
Still we posted up on Penn Avenue
Yeah
Danger, danger, this another banger
Feelin' like they know me, little homie, I'm a stranger
Moved out to the boonies, now I never deal with neighbors
No breaks, Speed Racer
I'm a Speed Racer 
I'm a Speed Racer Well, off the walls with these raps
Better call ya homies off, cause we back
Had it locked all along, I'm not falling off
I'm too smart to fall for these traps
Sitting in the parking lot, my seat back
Getting topped off some mornings, freeze that
Gotta be a God with all of these racks
I don't wanna talk to y'all, the flow Alcamo
And I'm finding this hard to relax
Wonder where my mind has gone, I've seemed sad
When you try'na hide from us, I'm the final boss, and the chance for y'all to feed Mac
Bitches started, wanna be that
Homie you be lying wanna be all I spit facts
These motherfuckers wanna hold me back
And they got me blinded all I see's fact
Talking 'bout a rematch, I be in the belly of the beast playing Dreamcast
Tell me where the weed at
Get that up, little homie don't need that
I forgot my head, skip to my lou bitch
I jumped off the ledge
I like to geek by myself, this is no cry for help
I jumped off of the deep end
Me and my homies we out here
There's not much around here
Come jump off the deep end
 
We really do this  yeah
These motherfuckers can't fuck with my style
Human like me though, you don't come around me
Verses get buried six feet underground
I been waiting so long for what's coming now
And fuck what you heard
You want to see realness then come to the 'Burgh
It's up in the air, but be sure that everything we do is pure
When will these motherfuckers learn?
When will these motherfuckers learn?
When will these motherfuckers learn?
Y'all is boring, I've been scoring with a foreign-born model
Shooting porno then I fall asleep
All the Z's Zorro, I'm not sure though
Why did Lizzie McGuire never fuck Gordo?
Eating sushi, copping Toro
We surviving, it's a war zone out here
See, I'm far from normal out here
Rocking fleece when I'm on the beach, I snorkel out here
Yes I'm weird, do not fear the other world that I revere
And stay clear of all the bad guys, cool you in the clear
In the rain, I ain't scared, shit I really can't complain
I don't like what's down the drain, but it's cool, let me explain
I'm alive, I'm okay, do not entertain the lies that they say
You gon' find your way, we just take up space hereHey yeah, hey yeah
Well, I just need a little space, I can be my own me
Yeah, I'm just givin' you a taste
It's some one and only, this that one and only
Yeah, I got what you need, what you need, what you need
Shit, you know how it be, how it be, how it be, yeah
All I ever needed was some one and only, this that one and only
Well, hello, good evenin'
I'm with you long as I'm breathin'
For every season, my girl, she keep on keepin' me decent
I'm workin', not takin' weekends
I barely got time for sleepin'
Searchin' for meanin', fiendin' for freakiness
How it's bein', shit
I been the coldest, since winter solstice, mmm
I had a soul, I know that shit is frozen, mmm
Out of control, I am a livin' moment, mmm
I got that dopamine, know if you want it, yeah
Feel like I'm runnin' out of time, a couple days behind
This shit that's runnin' through my mind
There ain't no way I'm fine
And maybe I'm just wastin' time
Sick of playin' games, get out my gymnasium
I am a collector, of money and pressure
There's nobody better, out of my skull, I'm Hannibal Lecter
Yes sir, killin' all the noise
You know how it go; first you build it, then destroy
Well, I just need a little space, I can be my own me 
Yeah, I'm just givin' you a taste
It's some one and only, this that one and only 
Yeah, I got what you need, what you need, what you need 
Shit, you know how it be, how it be, how it be, yeah 
All I ever needed was some one and only, this that one and only
Yeah, yeah
Okay, scatter brain, scatter brain
On my own island, I'm a castaway, who rackin' up these accolades?
You already know, so I don't have to say
I'm comin' up with words just like a motherfuckin' Scrabble game
Don't put out my wildfire , wildfire 
Take me up a mile higher, a mile higher 
Talkin' shit, we outside, we outside
I'm makin' motherfuckin' classics in my downtime 
I'm a giant, how the fuck you talkin' down to me?
This that shit that make a hater raise up out they seat
And I can't see you from my balcony
I'm in the clouds and you lookin' like the ground to me
Yeah, told 'em already, I tell 'em again
I'ma keep killin', I'm livin' until I'm a hundred and ten 
Yeah, invincible, this shit is never gon' end
So tell a friend to tell a friend
Who tell a friend, who tell a friend
Well, I just need a little space, I can be my own me 
Yeah, I'm just givin' you a taste
It's some one and only, this that one and only  
Yeah, I got what you need, what you need, what you need 
Shit, you know how it be, how it be, how it be, yeah 
All I ever needed was some one and only, this that one and onlyI know people that try, people that don't
People that fly through the air, just float like smoke
I know people that joke, know people that's rich, know people that's broke
Know people that love, people that hate
Some tell you that you good, some say you doin' great
Hey, I know people can't wait
They wanna hear every single thing I gotta say
Some people act cool, some act phony
People are your friends, but they never be your homies
I know people think they know me
Like there's a lame, untalented old me
Girls wanna own me, labels wanna clone me
Haters wanna choke me, stoners wanna smoke weed
People never gonna change
'Cause no two people are the same, hey
We, we are just two people
What more can we do?
Give me one more day
I'ma spend it with you, with you
I can't complain that people know my name
And when I come back home, not a damn thing change
I bet people can't believe
Some after the money
Some want a degree
If you showin' love, then you cool with me
I'm the same old dude before the jewelry
And everything kinda new to me
Things ain't nothin' like they used to be
People thought I wouldn't
Some people probably thought I could
Some people think the boy turned to Hollywood
Livin' up, every day worthwhile
Dudes run away when they see the girl smile
I'm glad I get to call her mine
This the type of thing so hard to find
You can't tell a star to shine or a carpet fly
Shit's gonna happen, it's just all in time
We, we are just two people
What more can we do?
Give me one more day
I'ma spend it with you, with you
I'm dealin' with somebody, and I don’t know what to do
They may not understand you 'cause they see you on the move
Girl, this dinner's over, I'm tryna get you to my room
'Cause I've been goin' crazy, baby, you don't got a clue
We, we are just two people
What more can we do?
Give me one more day
I'ma spend it with you, with youI know that it is freezing but I think we have to walk
Waving at the taxis; they keep turning their lights off
But Julie knows a party at some actor's west side loft
Supplies are endless in the evening; by the morning they'll be gone
When everything is lonely I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper; have my own conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
The mask I polish in the evening, by the morning looks like shit
And I know you have a heavy heart; I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
But me I'm not a gamble you can count on me to split
The love I sell you in the evening, by the morning won't exist
You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
You just keep going to the bathroom always say you'll be right back
Well it takes one to know one, kid, I think you've got it bad
But what's so easy in the evening, by the morning is such a drag
I've got a flask inside my pocket we can share it on the train
If you promise to stay conscious I will try and do the same
We might die from medication, but we sure killed all the pain
But what was normal in the evening, by the morning seems insane
And I'm not sure what the trouble was that started all of this
The reasons all have run away but the feeling never did
It's not something I would recommend, but it is one way to live
Cause what is simple in the moonlight, by the morning never is
What's so simple in the moonlight, now is so complicated
What's so simple in the moonlight, so simple in the moonlightAyo, Jerm
I think we got 'em here, man
Most Dope. Pittsburgh, what's good?
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay 
Hey, we've been waitin' way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song 
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay 
Hey, we've been waitin' way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song 
Hey, I kind of feel like I deserve this
Butterflies all up in my stomach like a first kiss
Just a wordsmith usin' poetry and more
But distracted by these girls who want their Juicy Couture
Yeah, this life is all about material things
I got kids tricks, bitch, I'm the cereal king
And everything better if you relax and chill
So my seat back for weed naps, we need that for real
I took my heart, put it all out on a CD
You now rockin' with the bees knees
I'm the, the cat's pajamas, the coolest of the cool
The kid that got 'em gassed, tappin', usin' up they fuel
When they first heard him spit, didn't think that it would be shit
M-O-S-T to the D-O-P-E kids
 now you hangin' with a G, bitch
I want money, but they say I need Jesus
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay 
Hey, we've been waitin' way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song 
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay 
Hey, we've been waitin' way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song 
Ayo, I'm half-man, half-amazin'
Flyer than a penguin, you dryer than a raisin
Hot like Cajun, bringin' all the girls to the Days Inn
Ready for a little love makin'
Yeah, I want it now, but they tell me, "Have some patience"
Feelin' on top of the world since graduation
Now I do music all day 'cause there ain't no other option
Drivin' to Connecticut, then flyin' up to Boston
I put it on for my city, always showin' love
And overdosin' drugs had the people throwin' up
They say, "What up?" when I drop in
I'm just chillin' back in my seat: Joe Swanson
Yeah, I used to steal iPods and pawn them
Now I take my girl shoppin', no problem
Live it up every second, life don't got a sequel
It's all good, thumbs up to my people
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay 
Hey, we've been waitin' way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song 
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay 
Hey, we've been waitin' way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song Above all fuck the law bitch I'm on now

My rappin' cadence is fascinating
This game that I'm calibrating
Have buildings evacuated whenever my name is said
I hate the Federal-lines spending time getting high
Watched over by heaven's eyes protect me from this genocide
Kill the king many tried success is yet to come
When you come across a killer under stress it's best to run
My mind dots with no limits shit a gun is just a gun
When I'm spittin' bone chillin' this ain't shit I'm having fun
You ain't gonna rap like me put a city on the map like me
Sell a beat bring it back like me killing tracks when I'm half asleep
You ain't gonna chase your dreams you ain't never gon' live your life
Fucken movie gonna make a scene sit back let me hit the light
Simple knowledge but it's true don't fuck with me don't fuck with you
What you doing running throughs thats from a view of love and truth
This a business no one gives a shit about you

'Cause I'm just  a kid , but they tell me I'm the man
Hey, hey 
I be goofy, kind of funny, actin' stupid, but they love me
We don’t do it for the money, just some food up in my tummy
Feelin' cool, livin' great, in the mood, tryna sway
Ice cubes in my drink, never doin' what they say
They some losers full of hate, a nuisance gettin' cake
What I'm doin' every day, probably ruin all your games
I got some brand new clothes, fresh, right out the package
The moon lookin' like I could reach right up and grab it
So close to the sky, I'm high
Was a youngin' who would hope to be fly, oh my
God, now I'm everywhere with my squad
When I spit a rhyme, they applaud
And I say, "Thank you, thank you, you're far too kind"
You heard everybody's music, but wait 'til you hear mine
They either hate or they on your side
Fuck it, we ridin' 
Playin' games just to ease your mind
Damn, I'm high 
And I know  that they  never understand
'Cause I'm just  a kid , but they tell me I'm the man
Hey 
If you know me, you are hatin', listen, homie, I've been waitin'
For a golden opportunity to know that I'ma make it
Where I'm goin', I could take it, went from flowin' in the basement
To shows in all stages, on the road to different places
Got they thumbs in the air, smile on they faces
Fans with grey hair and fans rockin' braces
Fans who be buyin' me drinks to get me wasted
Groupie hoes, thirsty as hell and wanna taste it, heh
See, this life even shocks me
I got some people on my nuts, call 'em jockey, haha
And I ain't even gettin' cocky
But if you hatin', I'ma tell you this: Watch me
'Bout to do somethin' amazin', bro
World changin' my brain, got a gang of flows
And this for those who always came to shows
And who were still by my side with no bank to blow, whoa
They either hate or they on your side
Fuck it, we ridin' 
Playin' games just to ease your mind
Damn, I'm high 
And I know  that they  never understand
'Cause I'm just  a kid , but they tell me I'm the man
HeyHad some baggy gear, now my clothes tailored 
Had a fitted cap, now I rock a snapback 
Uh, I used to rock a double XL
Now the ladies all say I dress well
With a nice pair of jeans, LRG or Evisu
Crew neck sweatshirt, hat and some clean shoes
Pockets stayed equipped with some paper and some gold piff
Pack of gum, squares, Blackberry and a phone clip
Got Most dope Clique, bunch of mothafuckers lookin' fresh
Crooks and castle dress, sloppy sloppy haters shouldn't mess
Walkin' by your lady and I'm sorry if I took her breath
You was just baby, cryin' til you end up shook to death
 fade away like an Etch A Sketch
Don't second guess, ain't nobody better dressed
Text hoes wearin' less clothes than her mama like
Church girl, always go to school, she the honest type
But when it comes to boys she like 'em bad
So holla at the kid I got swag
Had some baggy gear, now my clothes tailored 
Had a fitted cap, now I rock a snapback 
Knick knack paddy whack, give that boy some clothes
Imitate the kid, you may get yourself some hoes
Snap back, flat cap, abstract swagger
Kid come correct never messin' up the pattern
Y'all jigsaw puzzle, mismatch mess
Got my J's on with some jeans lookin' fresh
Yes, my colors match
And I ain't no other cats lookin' like the kid, yeah none of y'all fuck with Mac
You rockin' somethin' that lookin' like a lumberjack
How you wearin' 3 different t-shirts under that?
Teach you how to dress real stylish, I'm the wildest
Nothin' on me lookin' childish
Fire talk, I am hot
And, y'all is just some mild sauce
Got my clothes tailored, fit so nicely
Soon you'll see these mothafuckers dressin' just like meYeah
It's not official news here, as far as I'm concerned it didn't happen, you shut your mouth
One time
What are you afraid of, because the people might find out?
Two times
This news if not official, you were never under the assumption, it's perfectly clear
Three times
I said it was none of your God damn business
One time, tw-two times two, there's two times two twos, three
Three times, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, um yeah
Raps millenniums
Ain't no use tellin' them my plans for the rebellion
The music got me innovator, power no generator
It's the same me, just a couple new developments
They sellin' us our dreams
And we couldn't buy them back if they were sellin' them for free
I speak for the diseased and the misunderstood
I left the 'burg for a minute, but it's still all good
I push the Beamer and the Benz about to cop the Bentley
Fuck your feelings and your friends you will not correct me
I do this shit correctly, leave a murder scene messy
Dancin' with two lefties screamin' fucking Elvis Presley
What do you do when you want to get high
So you call up your connect
Your connect tell you he's dry
It's time to quarantine thinkin' you for sure a fiend
Now your pleasant dreams start to morph into a horror scene
I take morphine and drink chlorine
Hit the zoo see the lion cage and have an orgy
Drink WD-40, tell a bunch of stories about the make-believe glory
It's that back ally bum fight
Make sure you sittin' up right
Aristocratic pussy ring her bell then she cum twice
I never read the horoscopes
I go to see the oracle
For fortunes, I ignore her though
Just a couple words from my mortal soul
Time travel, tryin' to get back
But the portal closed
All-terrain game, bitch, I'm durable
Mister, drifter everythin' is portable
I'm playin' Dominos with the common folk
Lose a hundred dollars quickly
Guess that's all she wrote
And everybody got their pot of gold
Even if it's just a loose fifty in the laundry load
Start to understand, we are not alone
Try to figure out the difference between frogs and toads
Shit gets real then you got to go
It's a rocky road when you walkin' home
Yeah
You walkin' home, I'm walkin' home
Just a couple thoughts as I'm walkin' home
Lookin' at my feet as I'm walkin' home
Lookin' at the street as I'm walkin' home
Thinkin' of my dreams as I'm walkin' home
Be safe when you walkin' home
When you walkin' home, I'm walkin' homeYeah, yeah
I'm sittin' in a car full of bitches
Makin' art with 'em, screamin', "Carpe diem"
This is mothafuckin' freedom, ain't it?
I came to free the nation
Do the macarena with a waitress at the Applebee's
Who'd rather be a cheetah, and
One day, I'ma be the greatest, retire my jersey
I'm the people's favorite; Y2K, Nelly, Dream Land, Kirby
Have 'em bow down, how the ground sound? Dirty
I'm way beyond okay, these hoes ain't
Worthy of the nut-bust
Up-chuck flows when I'm fucked up
You want a war? Bitch, I'm Chuck Norris with the nunchucks
Lord of all this funk stuff, somethin' like a oracle, I gotchu
It's kung-fu Keanu, I'm the one, what?
Droppin' like dump trucks, made it through the sadness
What does everybody run from? You marchin' through the madness
I'ma kidnap the rap game, hold the bitch captive
Full of so much regret, I should've been a Catholic
Jewish, Buda, Baptist, cooler than a cactus
You sleepin' on my shit, then I'ma dookie on your mattress
Whoa, and that smell like roses
Just got myself back, run and tell that, homie
It's only me, myself, and I
That's all I need though
Dreamt I would teach myself to fly
It was just a dream though
When I am all alone, I close my eyes
Turn on the music, blow my mind
Ooh-oh-oh
 Okay
And in my mind, I'm enormous
Like a giant rhino-saurus or a dinosaur of violent forces
Eyes in the sky, can't find the floor, I'm kinda sorta 
The medication got me feelin' all 
Yeah, I'm chasin' paper like I'm broke
Never cater to these hoes, the creator of this dope shit
Got my own chef, plus a waiter and a hostess
Hot as the equator, but I'm rarer than the solstice
Don't trip, breath of fresh air if you want it
They always starin' at me kinda like they seen a ghost
Knock 'em out, T-K-O
Gettin' money is the motive and the pussy just a bonus
Flows is explosive, make a girl sweat like aerobics
Yoga, fuckin' king cobra, boa
Constrict no bitch, don't even know her
Belushi in a toga, house full of animals, Jedi, Yoda
Everybody wanna grow up and be Hova
I'd rather be Darwin, Clark Kent
New G-Wagon with the dark tint
Came a long way from sellin' dubs by the park bench
Now we can celebrate, I want this shit forever, mane
It's only me, myself, and I
That's all I need though
Dreamt I would teach myself to fly
It was just a dream though
When I am all alone, I close my eyes
Turn on the music, blow my mind
Ooh-oh-oh
The music, I can fix you with the music
Do you feel this in the music?
People need to hear the music, the music
The music, I can fix you with the music
Do you feel this in the music?
The people need to hear the music, the musicHey
Microphone testing, testing
You playin' politician, you Martin Sheen on The West Wing
Guessing the best thing for me to do is spit it
This shit is never a gimmick, you listen more than a minute
I’ve been spittin' flows since the kid was six-years-old
And if you listen close I’ll do this like some mismatched clothes
It’s whatever, put it together, you never could be this clever
I’m rockin' the mic forever, you gonna stop me never
I’m cocky, because I love it, you Rocky without the punches
Hockey without the ice, and boxes without the lunches
Flowin' like me, no one and that got you mad, bitch
Saw your boys are nothin' but just a-verage
I ain’t tellin' nobody how they should live their life
I got my own shit to deal with, so that just isn’t right
I’m just tryna to leave the crib, go out and live tonight
Shit, fuck that, I'm locked in the lab, workin’
Droppin’ a track, beats get bodied and bagged, certain
See the world through first, second, and third person
Omniscient, listenin' so efficient
Trapped in my own goal line, ready to go the distance
Consider it a privilege that you get to witness
History in the makin', you fucking bitches
Haha, just playin' witcha'll

Baby won't quit tho, she a fighter
I'm like "God damn, it was just a one-nighter"
Don't know what I said to her
But now, the girl I'm deadin her

That's what Cam told me to tell you..One, two, three, four
 Calisthenics in my head

'Cause after a while, it just don't seem that bad
Nothin' enough 'til it's over
Where were you headed when I left you?
Why couldn't you just wait around?
And I know that after a while, it just won't seem that bad
What should I do for now?
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, it just ain't that bad
Slow down before everything change
24/7, now I say, "Things are lookin' up"
But I could be drunk, I just—
Hold onto my arm one time

Everybody know that the boy got sweet flow
Then my money get a couple more zeros
We go ‘til the weed run out
Look at people in my past like “see me now?”
On it, supersonic, my words gonna hook ‘em on phonics
I got it, that’s why I talk shit, bitch, I’m fillin’ up my wallet quick
If they ever wanna come and try and copy me
It’s mine, you can look at the apostrophe
You whine, but then you carving out apologies
Goin’ at Mac Miller, now you follow me
Set the bar high, take drugs at the car drive
It’s alright, a false eye - in it for the distance, par five
Yeah, I’m gifted, aren't I?
Ride by, pump my shit - if you hatin’, suck my dick
I’mma do me, homie, watch it get me fuckin’ rich
I like my seat back, cup full, weed rolled, fuck school
I’ve been gettin’ money, what the fuck have you been up to?
Up to, up to, what the fuck have you been up to?
Livin’ out my dreams, boy, what the fuck have you been up to?
I like my seat back, cup full, weed rolled, fuck school
I’ve been gettin’ money, what the fuck have you been up to?
Up to, up to, what the fuck have you been up to?
Livin’ out my dreams, boy, what the fuck have you been up to?
Ain’t nobody hit a dope flow like me
The boy can speed it up like OMG
Don’t claim to be tough, you can hate on me, but
I’mma still get money, homie, let me be
Job for you, career for me
Took you lifetimes, took a couple years for me
Now, I got all the people all hearin’ me
They may not like it, but they listening
So fresh, so clean – hoes show ass to impress my team
I’m a MVP, you second string, that’s why I got your girl text messaging
Tryna make enough money for a pinky ring
Make money, make money, it’s a simple thing
Grind on, grind on, money what my mind on
It’s gonna be my seat, called fives on
You ain’t on what I’m on - just chillin’ here, tryna get my shine on
Now the fans want a pic, no Nikon
Hung over in the morning, where's the night gone?
Ride by, pump my shit - if you hatin’, suck my dick
I’mma do me, homie, watch it get me fuckin’ richSlow down, crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But if you're so smart, tell me why is you still so afraid?
Where's the fire, what's the hurry 'bout?
Better cool it off before you burn it out
So much to do, only so many hours in a day, hey
You know when the truth is told
You can get what you want, you can just get old
Gonna kick off 'fore you even get halfway through, ooh
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?
Slow down, you're doin' fine
You can't be everything you want to be before your time
Though it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight, night
Too bad, it's the life you lead
So ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
You can see when you're wrong
You know, can't always see when you're right. you're right, right
Got your passion, got your pride
Don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, don't imagine they'll all come true, ooh
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?
Slow down, crazy child
Take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while
It's alright, you can afford to lose a day or twoWhen I was a kid, back in kindergarten
That's when I was a kid, you know? What does it mean?
Yeah, yeah, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
Yeah, um, do you—
Yeah, damn
We been doin' this since you was still in diapers
Keep it movin' like the wipers, cameras shoot us like a sniper
I had dreams of fuckin' me an R&B bitch
I am the melody, who's tellin' me where harmony is?
It's all been a trip like dollars that I drop on my whip
I keep a girl, but when I'm with my friends, I call her my bitch
 I'ma need a evolution, just illusion
I'm out in space, there's no one left but Houston
I'm at the studio, I'll prolly take some acid after, but
Right now, me, Evan Adams watchin' battle rappers
Filet with every flow, you more like kale, bruh
Illest since I've been in it, don't know what else I can tell ya
And I don't watch TV shows no more
'Cause I got too much on my plate, I'm never home no more
I'm smokin' cigarettes, they fuckin' up my vocal cords
I like me 'xactly how I is, yeah
I like me 'xactly how I is
I like me 'xactly how I is
I like me 'xactly how I is
And I, and I, and I, I been the hardest since kindergarten kickball
Feelin' such a drug and I've been goin' through the withdrawl
I'm involved with shit that'd kill y'all if you would try it
They worry about my crazy ass, but nah, I'm just a riot
Flow is ultraviolet, I alter minds up when I open up
Cold as fuck, literally stuck in bed, pneumonia
I'm Obi-Wan Kinobi, bruh, surroundin' sound like Dolby does
Fisherman, slangin' bitches dick, I got the Moby plug
Some is built to last, some is built to crumble
And I ain't sayin' I ain't lyin' in the jungle
I'm in Tribeca chillin', feelin' like the daily double
Who you playin' with? I came for trouble
And I send my bitch runnin' to the store real quick
Told her bring me somethin' good, none of that healthy shit
Who else you know that's out here raisin' hell like Lyft?
I can only be myself, that's it
I like me 'xactly how I is
I like me 'xactly how I is
I like me 'xactly how I is
I like me 'xactly how I isTake me to paradise
Cause this games about as fair as life
We in a war that nobody gets to fight
Spit my life
Bring truth to the people
I'm just a kid that likes to do shit illegal
I spent the night to rock
But this writers block is kinda like the cops
Holding me back, I keep my dro in a sack
So while I'm holding this track, I keep my mind straight
MC's fold and collapse due to the crime rates
So I dip and climb gates, you never see me where you find jake Kid who rhymes great taking it back for old times sake
Times change and no one wasn't with you in the past
But I was letting records spin while I was sitting in the class
I take two hits and pass while I listen to this jazz
Walking home alone to find some kids to whip they ass
'Cause fuck it
See the streets is cold, they might be eating your soul
Rolling with dough like a pizza roll
I used to steal little shit out the convenient store
They used to catch me ask me "Mac, what you need this for?"
I said "It's just a tootsie roll, can I please just go?"
Paradise, I believe I'm home, yo
Take me to paradise

I'm just a kid that likes to do shit illegal
They act like I never have to face the heat
Cause I got a place to sleep and a plate to eat
I come reeling, on the real, I gotta thank my moms
Cause there ain't shit wrong with making songs
So lets blaze this bomb till the haze is gone
I write shit you copy and paste your songs 
God damn Im making these hot jams
And I ain't showing love to the dudes thats not fam
My words is all over these beats like hot pans
I got fans so I plot plans for the top stands
And when that day comes homie I'mma stay young
Like peter pan even if Im sleeping in a van
I just need a couple grams so I can feed a struggling fam
I got a dream to see some seats thats filled with fans
Paradise, no easy street
So if I get hungry, I'mma eat this beat
Take me to paradise

That's what it is, damn that girl can sing
Teressa LaGamba ladies and gentlemen and I'm outHey, hey, hey 
92 'til infinity and beyond and beyond
Aight, look 
Hey
When I was fifteen, it was my dream to work with Preem
He believe in what I do, so now he's makin' this beat
And I'm writin' these rhymes, makin' sure that I kill it
Shinin' like I'm acrylic, the government can't conceal it
My style, they try to steal it, 'cause people startin' to feel it
I'm goin' on these adventures, somethin' like on a field trip
And now I'm growin' up, lookin' around this planet
Some shit be goin' on and I just can't understand it
No need to panic, gotta expand this 
A million downloads, I'm takin' over your bandwidth
Moments all candid: Kodak
Reminisce and go back
Life real good, want y'all to know that
Don't have no deal and no half a mill
Just on my Gang Starr shit with some Mass Appeal
Go platinum independently, incredibly dope
Ya need a telescope to come and get at me
The naked eye could never see and label my identity
They see my middle finger, shut the fuck up and let me be
That's how it's always been and how it will be
Filthy ass rhymes, makin' money, but I'm still me
Flippin' the mics, spittin' this nice
Never could get everything that I liked
Now I can cop it no matter the price
Fuck it, forget it, I'm rappin' for life
Can't tell me shit, I got my own mind
Six in the mornin': that's go time
Face the facts, you got to understand, ain't no stoppin' me
Face the facts, but all—all you gotta do is keep it real with a playa
Face the facts, you got to understand, ain't no stoppin' me
You know how the story goes
And—and—and if you do what I do, then go and follow
Hey
Had to take the beat and let it breathe, usin' up the oxygen
The kid, he go and rock and there ain't nobody that stoppin' him
Poppin' up, bars on bars, you see me stockin' up
Workin' every second of the day is still not enough
Not on that cocky stuff, want y'all to acknowledge us
If you don't suck my dick, bitch, esophagus
You probably just go all on the internet
See a conversation, then you feel the need to interject
I ain't finished yet, you don't think this kid a threat?
I'm on a , ain't find me supervision yet
You a MP3, I'm still in cassette, vintage yet
Futuristic with some shit that split your deck
My cadence complex, rhyme without a concept
Atomic rhymes, you just a stupid fake bomb threat
Six in the mornin' and I'm writin' these rhymes
Workaholic, so you know that every night is a grind
Face the facts, you got to understand, ain't no stoppin' me
Face the facts, but all—all you gotta do is keep it real with a playa
Face the—the facts, you got to understand, ain't no stoppin' me
You know how the story goes
And if—and if—and if you do what I do, then go and followAha
Wake up in my king size bed
Girls all around me, eyes all red 
The true life of a player kid
It's nice to wake up to a naked bitch 
Got the finest clothes, diamonds, hoes
Goin' to sleep on a pile of dough
Lacoste, Phantoms, yards, mansions
Piff in the cannons, house in the Hamptons 
Big parties every night
This is the life of the paradise
My main man Twista told 'em right
I make 'em celebrities overnight 
Grammys, Oscars, starrin' in movies
Got a pool house, four cars, and jacuzzis 
On my way up, gettin' my cake up 
Wake up!
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away
I got groupies who got groupies
And I buy a new car every two weeks 
My chain got diamonds in it
And my whip got a diamond finish 
Got the MTV j-j-jam of the week 
Sign autographs when I stand in the street 
Plus I been all over BET, Columbia Records and D.T.P. 
Both want me to sign to their label
Plus I got my own channel on cable 
Always fresh, court-side, best view 
Kanye West and beats from The Neptunes 
Stackin' cream, magazines
Kids dressed like me on Halloween
They lovin' my mixtapes, money like Bill Gates
I'm on top and it feels great 
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away
It's truly a dream come trueYeah, said I
Made a promise with my deranged conscious
In return he told me the voice in my head would quiet down
All I gotta do is never speak of his existence or eternal soul
Otherwise it's terminal
And I hate to worry those
With my dirty nose and my perverted ways
It hurts me that I hurt you
Never meant to cause a person pain
Deteriorate a skeleton, regurgitate my vertebrae
Lord, I beg your mercy
Can you take me on a perfect day?
I always wondered what determines fate
And who's tendin' to the garden by the pearly gates
They don't want you to be anything but what they tell you
Sell you on a lie and watch the murder rate circulate
Lord merciful
He ride around heaven in his '69 convertible
No shirt beneath the purple coat
Known to get surgical at the turkey bowl
He throw a baseball like a motherfuckin' girl though
What is this underworld you speak of
And why is everybody tryna teach us?
Why is it considered so rude to walk around in the nude
And why do we hurt the ones that we love?
Yeah, I always wondered if Jesus had a ego
Insecurities when he got emo
Why do I insist on goin' over your head?
Why don't I just make hits?
Gotta be so weird
Yeah, yeah
I've been awake for so long, I feel myself disintegratin'
But I'll never stop the innovation
I'm addicted to creation, that's the world's greatest miracle
My vehicle, no one told me how to steer it though
I'm toyin' with my hallucinations
Hope it don't spoil and turn into inferno
I'm lost in the wormhole, searchin' for the hurt souls
Watchin' as the germs grow
Take over the Earth slow
I'm unaware in a comfy chair sippin' Merlot
Waitin' 'til I hear my number called and it's my turn to go
Insomnia, oh, how I always get along witcha
They don't want us to be friends, but I'm so fond of ya
And I can stay in Narnia forever
The human brain couldn't measure how the pleasure feel
I disagree with what they said was real
And, if this a war I need a better shield
Yeah
This ain't nothin' but another idea to be forgotten at the bottom of a drawer in my apartment, lost
I tried to bargain with the man upstairs
I just hope I got a fan up thereIf we could know where we was going to go
We'd probably never see tomorrow
So if I keep on making love to these songs
I'mma be good for the rest of my life
Hey, some people just don't want it
Hey, whatever it is, whatever it is
But I think I got it
Hey, whatever it is, whatever it is
Aye, whatever it is, they're gettin' it straight
I'm too obsessed, too dedicated, never escape
I ain't scared, I'ma go in, lookin' like I'm glowin'
Runnin' on beats, you show me your feet, if you ever be down to flowin'
Now, I got a notion, I'mma put this into motion
Speedin' through the present, tryin' to get there and coach them
Hopes the smoke man will be there soon
For now the music up loud and the beat on smooth
I'm just rhymin', spittin' so efficient
Keepin' the tradition, while seekin' to be different
Just dropped K.I.D.S., but I'm a man of many words
You had to do it big, but couldn't never stop the work
Now you heard my words and your bubble gonna burst
Yeah we on third but say what's up to the homies on first
If I can, I'ma kick it, rip it just cause I love it
Now they see me, ask me to spit it right out in public
Hey, yo, rappers got time that they're wastin', hatin'
When they could focus on their own grind, skatin'
They mad I got fans and they mad I got love
Cause me and music fit like a glove, so snug
All you angry mothafuckers go and form a club
Cause when you come around me, it ain't nothin' but love
I got girls givin' hugs, people dappin' me up
And you in the corner, like, "Oh man, Mac sucks!"
Been a long grind and a little bit of luck
Feelin' blessed everyday for the way I'm comin' up
I can promise you this: I ain't even close to done
Just pray to god that I'm safe when the soldiers come
They hear me, they forgettin' if I'm old or young
Got this music on lock, but I open up
All the time, cause my bars and my rhymes be my lifestyle
Blowin' white clouds, I'm gettin' high right nowWhy, Will?
Fuck you, bitch
Just kiddin', buddy
DJBooth.net

At I.D. Labs, cars 
TreeJ, Q, Jerm, E and Will here

Gotta get the shout-outs in real quick
A'ight, I'm about get it in
Hey , hey , hey
Last name stoner, first name I'ma
Ain't nobody higher, sippin' on some Aunt Jemima
Champagne, campaign, bubbly for the hoes
So, fill up ya glass, everybody, make a toast
It's a new day, fresh start like it's toothpaste
Take ya head off, you a toupee, I'm servin' bars like a soufflé
Rappers like to hate 'cause I'm chillin' and I'm gettin' all my tunes played
I do me though, kick a Ronaldinho
Mean flow, wear my jeans low, see my cheeks, ho
Long journey to the top of the ski slope
I keep away from all these haters and these mean hoes
She rock a pea coat to cover up them cheap clothes
Never knew that they would bite her in the ass
Late start, and I need to catch a flight so where the cab?
If I miss my plane, Benji gonna come and kick my ass
This and that, snapbacks from a fitted cap
Baggy clothes, ratty hoes gettin' rid of that
I'm so on point, you could play me out
DJBooth.net, go and put it out
You like to party? Well, I like to work
It's paper over pussy 'cause the money like to flirt
And I'm 'bout it, 'bout to hand the checks to my accountant
On my official shit, no, not on my whistle shit
Day job to me is like a book to those illiterate
I'm a kid, but you the one who throwin' hissy fits
You the one that never seem to feel me spittin'
Now I'm limited edition and you pussy like a clitoris
Most Dope syndicate, my people stand together
Through the rain, sleet, snow, any weather, it's whatever
I thought I told you that we won't stop
Got the crowd standin' up like they seat so hot
Got 'em like, "Yo Mac, when the beat gon' drop?"
Here, now pay attention 'cause believe this 
So I can preheat the  to eat up clock
D-J-B, double O-T-H, then dot
Net
Ooh, that spelling shit was kinda cool
Haha!
What the fuck are you lookin' at, dude?Takin' pictures of Q while he's sleepin'
It's a pastime
Uh
Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill 
This a muthafuckin' barbecue, for real 
All these days already gone by 
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
Put a little gin in the punch 
Grandma gettin' crunk, just fun
Nobody give a fuck 
All these days already gone by 
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
Hey, hey, hey
The door's open, I might as well just stroll in
Got some Arnie Palmer in my pitcher: call it Nolan
Ryan, try it once and then you go there
I am hopin' that we can kick it
Reminiscin' only about the good times
I know there's moments
When you probably love me, but you didn't wanna show it
Now I'm all around the globe, with everyone but you
I know you fuckin' miss me, chill and keep it cool
Never gettin' old, mane, grown, no Rogaine
Fill your plate with all that food, you better eat the whole thing
This a family reunion, all the grandmas be movin'
Runnin' in three-legged races, people would cry if they losin'
When I was two, my slide was blue
When I was gone, my ice cream cone was a giant wand
When my bike was all I was ridin' on
Jewelry from a Happy Meal, fuck it, I was happy still
Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill 
This a muthafuckin' barbecue, for real 
All these days already gone by 
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
Put a little gin in the punch 
Grandma gettin' crunk, just fun
Nobody give a fuck 
All these days already gone by 
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
Hey
Come and step inside the Electric Slide
Sprayin' squirt guns at you like it's pesticide
So why you buggin'?
Lil' man, stop buggin'
I gotta spend some time with some friends of mine
Get away from everything, go and rest your mind
It's not nothin'
Lil' man, it's not nothin'
All my little cousins actin' like some munchkins
Runnin' in the trees and they're cryin' out their eyes
Have to rush 'em to the ER, maybe just a Band-Aid will do it
You can sing along, please let the band play the music
Always nice you can come back home
Your friends go off, but then they come back grown
Nice to know that you're never alone
Family reunions whenever I'm home
Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill 
This a muthafuckin' barbecue, for real 
All these days already gone by 
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
Put a little gin in the punch 
Grandma gettin' crunk, just fun
Nobody give a fuck 
All these days already gone by 
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time Uh, look at you , look at you
Look at you, look at you )
I don't want this to come between us 
But right now I look the worst that you probably seen me 
The come down worse than the high, Momma, believe me
And that's true
You got some problems to deal with and that's you
I can't even talk, I ain't meanin' to act rude
It's just I'm just kinda hot and it's easy to catch 
I'ma leave it at that 
 And that's—
Me's tryna tell you somethin' 
But a feelin' like this has no words, so
I keep on wastin' time and ever since my angel died
The halo shine is rusted 
I say I'm fine, I'm frontin'
Every day I just been blunted
Mind is cloudy as my judgement, shit
You know I'm cut from the same cloth that they use for Kevlar
Ain't sober much, I've been faded off and I don't remember 
I'm goin' up like my name was God
Who the fuck are you sayin' I'm not?
My thoughts are heavy, weighin' down my brain with pressure
I'm pickin' up the roaches out the ashtray 
Yeah, ain't fuckin' with no hoes that's in the rap game 
There's somethin' different 'bout me
Ever since I whipped the Audi
Smell it like it's the shit around me
Feelin' like the Big Lebowski 
Sick of showin' sad faces
I was hidden in the bat cave where the bitches came in nightly
Keepin' it as spicy as my last name 
I bet a million dollars, show you who your friends are 
I don't need respect, just show me where the checks are 
The game is full of clones, you stick out like a red Ferrari
Go fix your problems, swipin' my American Express card 
You tell me I'm arrogant, I say that I'm certain 
I talk to my therapist, it ain't really workin' 
I can't tell if I'm just crazy or a genius 
You my weakness, it's becomin' inconvenient 
I don't want this to come between us 
But right now I look the worst that you probably seen me 
The come down worse than the high, Momma, believe me
And that's true
You got some problems to deal with and that's you
I can't even talk, I ain't meanin' to act rude
It's just I'm just kinda hot and it's easy to catch 
I'ma leave it at that
All of your screamin' got me smokin' weed to relax 
Yeah, some sativa to pass to feed the demons I have 
I never gave a fuck, why should I start now? 
Big dreams, small town
Get you while your guard down
The realest — speakin' in facts
This shit is — deeper than rap
I put my city — on the map
I'm rockin' a — P on my cap 
Tell him that Jesus is back
And all he after 
Is for a bottle of whiskey and some freaks he can smash
But to me it's as cheap as the fees in the cab
To go down the street and then back 
All this fever I have, heatin' the people to ash
I'ma start beatin' your ass for no reason 
Colder than the snow season 
Elevation, no ceilin' 
We all goin' home eatin'
And we done with dope dealin' 
Everything legitimate, limitless
We all got businesses
I made my way
The eight sideways, we infinite
Yeah, I bet a million dollars, show you who your friends are 
I don't need respect, just show me where the checks are 
I'm down to bang 'til I'm out the game like a red card
Chill in outer space in a Death Star
Hollerin' at bitches still 
Hope they down to chill at the crib and they freakish 
I don't want this to come between us
But right now I look the worst that you probably seen me
The come down worse than the high, Momma, believe me
And that's true
You got some problems to deal with and that's you
I can't even talk, I ain't meanin' to act rude
It's just I'm just kinda hot and it's easy to catch
I'ma leave it at that
Upon first glance, I look through the soul, no words spoken
Heart frozen, tear drops stained pillow cases roll over 
Got over that, built to last
I'ma pro from that to be honest
No goin' back, life's journey
No chosen path settin' sails around countless convicted felons
Maximum security
Only presence felt with is tested
No tellin', send us to death or to the chair 
In my ghetto, the children probably consider me the mayor 
Full-fledged, bein' gangster don't mean shit without the bread
Bread winners association, you not  wit' that, you dead 
Or deadbeat, fresh sneaks surroundin' my feet 
But walk like there no jury, get off right
Now let's shake it back from my loss
From the ones I thought thought like me
I'm greetin' they talk like me, well, until my back was turned
Old-fashioned clutch rest and can't handle it, back then turned
All black affair, I learned to order manslaughter
Peep out they flaws, attack 'em
Action brought them bands off 'em
Makin' statements places where I'm hated, flossin' jags on 'em
Out shoppin' out in Calabasas, mind still entrapped
Traps up in every cabinet
Fake bricks and counterfeit money in every closet
Just in case I'm caught slippin', you get me
You tried to rob your mind, plottin' where I'm thinkin'
Somewhat'll be mind bogglin', ten toes deep in the game
Step ahead of the corner, on my head or around it
My aggression rerouted, he had to die
The bitch violated, question me 'bout it
Go to war with whoever love who upset with about it
Flee the scene, jumpin' bonds
Detectives guessin' about me
Where the money come from? 
Cold cash makin' deposits
Arrest record's shot, I ain't never sentenced for bodies
Motorcycle was 
This a rented Ducati
Wide body, sippin' lean when I ride it
Feel like I'm flyin', nigga, watch how I glide it
Got it?Yeah 
She  chase a high that she'll never reach
Waste  her time with that ketamine
In her mind, it'll set her free
Why won't they let her breathe?
That  numbness‚ there ain't nothin' like that numbness
That  feelin' she in love with‚ let it go and say‚ "Fuck it" 
Yeah, fightin' with her mom, hard to get along
Everything  that you ever do is wrong
Things got complicated‚ she want to walk away 
Help's on the way, turn the funeral to a holiday 
All the pain, the tear drops fall on her face
Like  waterfalls 
Just like waterfalls 
She wants to be forgotten ‚ lonely way too often
She can't stop it all 
As her conscious fade away 
Colors fade to grey 
She hate the day, can't sleep at night
In her dreams, she might just be alright
If she drops it all 
If she drops it all 
Run, run
Chase them waterfalls , them waterfalls 
Run, run
This seems impossible , impossible 
Yeah, yeah
She can't remember the last time that she smiled
No company around, she need somebody now
Mom was never proud, dad was never that interested
He was always outta town, scared she gonna drown
In them waterfalls , in them waterfalls

Nobody ever notice that she don't talk at all

Cup of coffee in the mornin', but the mornin' when the sun down
Stayin' up late night
Take a swim with great whites, all I need is daylight
I'm tryna be a billionaire, she tryna be a playwright
Something 'bout this ain't right
Paint a picture on the wall
Better use your mind and you will find there's no such thing as law
Had that goddamn in '09, that holy shit the next year
Standin' on the coastline, the flows a bit too wet here
Most these motherfuckers are so easy to forget here
Toast to those who hold your own
I'm coast to coast through postal codes
The flow is cold as overcoats, I'm blowin' smoke at police
Fuck 'em, we ain't never gonna trust 'em, let me go free
Hit the road
You ain't doin' shit at home
Better get up out the crib and figure this out on your own
If you never live, you never know
If you never live, you never know
We, drink alone
Plottin' how to get some dough
Rollin' up the weed and watchin' Indiana Jones, but
If we never live, we'll never know
If we never live, we'll never know 
What's the difference 'tween a bitch and a bitch?
Well, a bitch ain't a bitch when his bitch start trippin'
Shit, I been smart
Spittin' by the benchmark
Wisdom of a Templar
This shit like liftin' with my left arm
Yeah, no need to wonder who your friends are
The Devil probably comin' for your soul when it get dark
So thank God all the time and protect art
Life is the beginning, best be ready for the next part
I swear to God they gon' feel me
Better get a job and get busy
I'm like a God in my city
Don't trust nobody, my shit be crazy
Better get up off yo' ass, somebody gon' pay me
Don't keep me waitin', yeah
And only God can judge me
When all the glamour go away, you only left with money
So I'm stackin' everyday I'm at the crib in clothes that's bummy
All them things you say don't mean a thing to me
Don't trust nobody
Hit the road
You ain't doin' shit at home
Better get up out the crib and figure this out on your own
If you never live, you never know
If you never live, you never know
We, drink alone
Plottin' how to get some dough
Rollin' up the weed and watchin' Indiana Jones, but
If we never live, we'll never know
If we never live, we'll never know
Yeah
Hold your temper, the flow can go forever
Fuck these little snakes, I got a cobra on the dresser
The flow is texture, colder than the snowy weather
You don't think that I'm the greatest, need to get to know me better
In a polo sweater and I'm chillin' for the weekend
Standin' in some muddy waters, swimmin' in the deep end, yeah
My bitch is sleepin', but I'm out here livin' decent
Pissin' on a fire engine, got me shittin' on the cement
I'm a dog, but aware of all my flaws
I'm a martyr for the cause
On the run, never bring it to a jog, no
This my job, though
Hit 'em with the crossbow
While I'm at the crib makin' tacos out of waffles
The God awful
Lookin' for apostles
The flow is old and dirty, but the people like it raw, though
I feel colossal
Savage man, I'm macho
Last forever, never gonna stop, no
Hit the road
You ain't doin' shit at home
Better get up out the crib and figure this out on your own
If you never live, you never know
If you never live, you never know
We, drink alone
Plottin' how to get some dough
Rollin' up the weed and watchin' Indiana Jones, but
If we never live, we'll never know
If we never live, we'll never knowWho the coldest motherfucker in the room?
Coldest motherfucker in the room?
Who the coldest motherfucker in the room?
Coldest motherfucker in the room?
Who the coldest motherfucker that you know?
Who the coldest motherfucker that you know?
Bring him 'round here he's gettin' froze
Roll it up, let's smoke
And tell me why your bitch look like Glenn Close
I'm on my own two, that's ten toes
First the bullets fly, somebody says "go"
Why you bent low when your Jordans' retro
Girls playin' games for the bills, they Drew Bledsoe
There's a lot that you can buy, but I'll never own
And a lot of information that I'll never know
Learn 'til they get concerned for my sanity
Your life is filled with vanity, needs a little clarity
This the truth, this a taste, can you handle it?
A million dollars couldn't cover up the damages
Naked girl at the crib makin' sandwiches
And when we makin' love I got a candle lit
Some romantic shit to put her in the mood
The world woke me up, now I'm lookin' at the snooze
Who the coldest motherfucker in the room?
Coldest motherfucker in the room?
Who the coldest motherfucker in the room?
Coldest motherfucker in the room?
Who the coldest motherfucker that you know?
Who the coldest motherfucker that you know?
Bring him 'round here he's gettin' froze
Life, look at my hands I'm the lord of the reigns
Musical cocaine brought me all of these Carrera keys
Soft top goin' hard on the block freeze that talk
And that plot about walkin' up on me
No security just my homies, the well-dressed army
Presidential arm piece, my credentials I'm a G
All access, Jets wherever you won't be
Snatch that 'vette for my mans the day of his prison release
Shoe was on the other foot I know he would've done the same thing for me
But we'll let that be
Park it in the spot right next to my B with the chrome wings
I was sent here to own things
Both sides of the court, colder than the airport
Therefore I'm the one them hoes here for, yeah what
Who the coldest motherfucker in the room?
Coldest motherfucker in the room?
Who the coldest motherfucker in the room?
Coldest motherfucker in the room?
Who the coldest motherfucker that you know?
Who the coldest motherfucker that you know?
Bring him 'round here he's gettin' frozeAin't nothin' else like me
I ain't nothin' like you, so what is going on? 
There must be somethin' wrong, you'll love me when I'm gone 
I'ma keep on doin' me, 'cause you don't even matter 
You, you just an actor, and I just ain't a rapper 
No, I'm one of a kind, I'm one of a kind 
Here's a prototype that I know you'll like, right
Head into the light on an overnight flight 
Never in your life you gon' see another me
I tend to catch the eye like a pair of double D's
I'm here, not the same, I'm a pioneer
Stabbed the game in the heart with a giant spear
Grind to see success, goddamn, it's clear 
 shine like a chandelier
I'm goin' through this cake
Spittin' 'bout what you relate
Never can you duplicate
Any of the music made
Gettin' super paid
Lookin' at a future star
They recognize me when I pass 'em in a movin' car
Always worried 'bout findin' out who you are
You know somebody, you gotta look into his heart
Yo mind so blind
I'm ahead of my time
'Cause I'm one of a kind, I'm one of a kind
I ain't nothin' like you, so what is going on?
There must be somethin' wrong, you'll love me when I'm gone
I'ma keep on doin' me, 'cause you don't even matter
No, you, you just an actor, and I just ain't a rapper
No, I'm one of a kind, I'm one of a kind
And my pops said:
"Young man, you ain't ready for the world ahead
Way too much marijuana, always havin' girls in bed
You gon' realize that life ain't a party
Fuck around, you gon' end up starving"
Fuck it, I stay fly, live free, die hard
No Bruce Willis, this the whole nine yards
Thought that I can rhyme bars
Go and buy cars, you gotta grind hard once the sunrise start
In my heart, great things in my future 
'Cause broke rappers, shit, that's just a rumor 
I see these diamond chains, mansion in they videos
They must got silly dough, do they really though?
Or is it all just a scam for your eyes?
 in disguise, goddamn, I can't decide
All these words here come from a mind
Got nothin' to hide, boy, I'm one of a kind
Walkin' through this world, I just take a look around
Ain't nobody here like me, don't nobody got my style
People say I'm different, I assure you that's okay
'Cause I'm way past tomorrow, and you stuck in today
I ain't nothin' like you, so what is going on?
There must be somethin' wrong, you'll love me when I'm gone
I'ma keep on doin' me, 'cause you don't even matter
No, you, you just an actor, and I just ain't a rapper
No, I'm one of a kind, I'm one of a kindShe lookin' fly, real fly in her Nikes
Fresh new Jordans or fresh pair of Ice Creams
Ooh, she's a dime, she keep 'em iced so nicely
The way she's rockin' them kicks, gotta make her my wifey, whoa
You lookin' fly, real fly in them Nike shoes
I'm lookin' for a wifey and it might be you
Ménage à trois, spend the night with two
It's alright with me if it's alright with you
Feel my hands rubbin' up and down your backside
Ma, you've got curves like a half-pipe
That's right, ma, you's a ten
And your man? You be rockin' nicer shoes than him
I'm in the spot with some juice and gin
Come to me
You a beauty with your Louis and Gucci
Baby girl, I ain't wanna be your man
But let me just write my number on your hand
At the party with a whole bunch of honeys here 
You got your Forces laced up with some bunny ears
But now I got you all alone, and the booze gone
So slip outta your clothes, but keep them shoes on
She lookin' fly, real fly in her Nikes
Fresh new Jordans or fresh pair of Ice Creams
Ooh, she's a dime, she keep 'em iced so nicely
The way she's rockin' them kicks, gotta make her my wifey, whoa
You lookin' fresh like whoa
Goddamn, lookin' so fly that you probably got a man
You lookin' right and he ain't here tonight, so
I won't tell him if you don't 
So let's roll, roll back to the crib
Grey Goose, lights dimmed, girl, that's how I live 
You got them kicks, fat ass, and some lips
Baby, you don't even gotta ask for a kiss
Shorty look proper, with kicks like Foot Locker
All done up, she a good shopper 
New jeans, blue tee, and her shoes clean
Uh, lookin' like she 'bout to seduce me
Just touch me, tease me, cute caressin'
A hundred thousand pairs in your shoe collection
Shh, I know you like to tell
But let me just lay back while you light my L
She lookin' fly, real fly in her Nikes
Fresh new Jordans or fresh pair of Ice Creams
Ooh, she's a dime, she keep 'em iced so nicely
The way she's rockin' them kicks, gotta make her my wifey, whoaYeah
Hahaha
Hey
Louis frames hide my bloodshot eyes
My disguise, from this world outside
Vivid description paints a picture for the blind
Got me on my syrup sippin' shit, slowin' down time
Uhh, Hidden from the shine
Trippy shit, she listen and then rewind
Put the black light on, close the blinds
Walkin' on the clouds, turnin' water into wine
As I travel through ya mind
I be swimmin' through ya thoughts
Creep outside the lines
Those who live within the box
Gone...
Seein' spots like chicken pox
So gone, Michael Jordan start missin' shots
Acid, tablets, down the hole with Alice
Smilin' like the cat is
Water from a cactus
Snap back, fallin' off my head, mad hat shit
Got the Earth spinnin' off it's axis
Feelin' like the shit, no diaper
Sippin' apple cider
Goin' back and forth like a windshield wiper
This gon' be another all nighter
'Cause I'm trippin' out
Yeah, I'm trippin' out
Got a bottle of water, couple tablets, and a half a zip
Pack your bags, we goin' on a acid trip
Don't mean to scare you
Just get inside the car
The driver sayin' where to?
To the top, please
Hidden from the news and paparazzi
It wake you up like coffee, yeah
Now, I'm layin in my strawberry fields
Appeal to my senses
And it seem so real
A figment of imagination, uh
And I've heard your prior allegations
And it's true
Bitch, I'm higher than you
Maybe goin' skitso
Open up the window
Trippy like the music on Nintendo
It's all good, bro
Roll some endo
Lost you at the twenty
But I'll see you in the end-zone
I'm trippin' out...Get the fuck outta my face
Byah 
I wake up, rub my eyes, dry vomit on my shirt
The light bulb goes off, my conscience is alert
My ex-girl hate me and the talkin' never work
My demons have no reason and that monster be the worst
Who lived this life well? I'm possibly the first
Got a saga, back by popular demand, I been a honest man
All my life, it's just the real, it ain't the wrong or right
You think the bitches wanna fuck you 'cause your songs is nice?
Blood stains on my shirt, musta had a awesome night
Reincarnate Ray Charles before he lost his sight
I'm on the mic like Jordan Nikes, try to sell my soul
But the devil broke, he can't afford the price
Shootin' pornos, havin' boogie nights
You a cookie-cutter motherfucker, pussy type
Sometimes I feel so blue, but I'm still lookin' white
Shit, I'm just like you, you said you just like who?
Well, I bust right through
Like a nut when you love life too much in a plush white suit
Shine, what the fuck lights do
And my wife just like her pussy 'cause she uptight too
Bro, this my crib, where I live, who the fuck invite you?
I'm a fat bitch addict, love my plus-sized boo
I told her roll over that roll over, that's fun time two
Don't get it twisted 'cause these bitches' bitches love dykes too
I pulled up, pulled out, soon as I cum, I'm through, shit
This, is, the hook
 This, is, the hook
 This, is , the hook
 This, is, the hook
Nobody guardin' this, had it locked up before I started it
Retarded shit, kinda like my father but don't Mark a bit
You see, I make it then they market it
Parked the whip in San Diego, findin' out where Carmen lives
These are my hungover thoughts, I'm so ashamed in Notre Dame
With a hunched over walk, yeah
I like my bitches when they fuck more than talk
And have the halos of an angel hidden up in a box
This evil is the easel that we paint upon
And those divas ain't no divas with no make-up on
I'm in the bed, she give me head like, "What's takin' long?"
I'm like, "It's hard to finish when this fuckin' Drake is on"
But it's my favorite song, I'm concentrated on the chord change
My impure brain, take it all the way, ignore pain
"Why you suck my dick like it's a chore, babe?"
I'ma turn these kids into a short stain
I'm too nice, always givin' you what you like
You can trust me, I'm like Dudley, I always do right
Bitches love me, must be the money, I'm on it tonight
Get the action then send her packed on a JetBlue flight
And nobody wanna fuck with a legend, I be on my shit
On a trip twenty-four seven, if you scared, go to church
I'm the God, I'm the Reverend
Most Dope be the squad that I'm reppin', shit
This, is, the hook
 This, is, the hook
 This, is, the hook
This, is, the ****
Well, get ready
Ooh, I hope you're ready
Ooh, I hope you're ready, ready
I hope you're ready
Let's go

If you want me to sing a song, I can sign a song for ya, hey, hey 
If you want me to sing a song, I can sign a song for ya, hey, hey, hey

Yeah
This that motherfuckin' real shit
Only givin' you that real shit
This that motherfuckin' real shit
Real shit, this that real shit
Real shit, this that real shit
Real shit, this that, this that real shit
Real shit, this that motherfuckin' real shit
That real shit, this that motherfuckin' real shit
That real shit that I told you 'bout
The real shit, real shit
This that motherfuckin' real shit, real shit
Are you ready for some real shit?
That real shit, this that motherfuckin' real shit, wooLet me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
See I'm one of a kind
There's a brain behind
All these different wonderful rhymes
Some people's livin in the past
Cuz they runnin from time
Seems like so long since big punisher died
Hope he see me when I'm lookin up from under the sky
I'mma tell you how it is cuz I got nothin to hide
And soul theory makes the beats that'll bump in the ride
This criminal lifestyle that I'm jumpin inside
A mastermind, superb with both sides of his brain
Roll me up into a swisher, start flyin away
But ash my soul, rub the L on the side of the tray
Cuz its hard looking up, like the sky when it rains
Smokin strains that levitate me like David Blaine
I'm a player and you hatin on my game
Say my name, cuz this here's my destiny child
Now that all the stress is off of my chest I can rest for a while
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax
Sit back, sit back, sit back we got you feelin so fine
With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin so high
Got me feelin so, feelin so, with this blunt of my mind
And I shall not hold my tongue
So i'mma speak till I fold my gums
I was told to run
Cuz every day is a colder one
I wake up not knowing if I'm old or young
I can't find my place so I lay upon these beats
Covering my pain with layers of melodic sheets
Mother earth's a bitch so when kingdom come
We gonna bring em some till thy will be done
And still to come is when I'm finally driven to insanity
By my family, who never seemed to be a fan of me
My knees are shaken, see I'm not able to stand
Cuz they label a man by his paper in hand
Sittin in a dark alley with some paper and pens
Writin, just thinkin when this day's gonna end
What can you say to a man who can't look at himself
When the image in the mirror keeps on yellin for help
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax
Sit back, sit back, sit back we got you feelin so fine
With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin so high
Got me feelin so, feelin so, with this blunt of my mind
Hip hop's child, you feel me do the touchin
Spittin got me smitten, no excuses for the lovin
I'm tryina get it written but I'm comin up with nothin
A couple words in each line filled with somethin somethin somethins
And to me, hip hop ain't got a criminal past
Its just explosions of sound as these syllables clash
Briain on critical mass
Fuck political trash
These politicians speakin, but its comin out they ass
Talkin bout "school is cool" and "drugs for thugs"
Tryina push me down the path, but I shall not budge
Cuz, i've been thinkin and I think I have a hunch
Who hand the mic to get enough
While me and music makin love
And my community, ain't all about who I choose to be
This life and what it do to me, the ruined opportunities
This figurative language that I'm speakin so fluently
Look back like a photo album seein who I used to be
Playin piano while I'm strummin guitar
Can't buy myself a spaceship so I'm runnin to mars
Stare at death in the face, like I'm under a car
And not everybody hatin, but enough for you all
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Just roll up
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax
Sit back, sit back, sit back we got you feelin so fine
With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin so high
Got me feelin so, feelin so, with this blunt of my mindA-yo undress your dollar and sleeping with the scholars
In bed with good and bad biz for the quali-
Fication to have gems played on the FM
Sleeping on us is not possible, the metham-
Phetamine flow keep them narcolepts all on go
Green light and no smoking up that green hype
Keep all your thoughts on haze, the backbones for the sound
Well I don't sound back in the days
The Soul's never outdated
Or overexposed or classified as underrated
Though loved by the popular, worthy of the corn
And when the word drops the whole block will warn ya
Told Mac Mill, you 'bout to mack millions
Millions of tweeters follow ya
A million skeezers wanna swallow you whole
Just watch the game and make sure it doesn't swallow your soul
Got some soul like De La do, they say I’m new
It’s nothing but some deja-vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja-vu, deja-vu
Got some soul like De La do, they say I’m new
It’s nothing but some deja-vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja-vu, deja-vu
I love snowboarding, getting my dick washed, writing graffiti
Out in Whistler with a goose on a beanie
I'm mack iller, me and Mac Miller, we mack for realla
Don't make me go back and jab your gorilla
Smoke mad kush, always in fresh pairs
Favorite kickin' dunks and fresh airs
Coolin' under the trees with trees
You know the kid 4-5-6, dice rollers
Put your bitch on her knees
Im stuck making paper, yo fuck what you want homie
The streets is hard luck we rolling with sharks only
Wu-Tang, the gang, the clique
Fucking with my favorite white boy will have your head hit a brick
Ayyo, its Pittsburgh Shaolin, we keeping it realer
Just do the knowledge I'm a Pittsburgh Steeler
The hydrogen and oxygen crew
Body count never read, hear what I said
And let it do what it do
Me, Pos and Rae and monopoly
Hit the lottery buying clothes losing closet space
Wu-Tang, De La, Most Dope
So cold, know I'm about blow, my flow's cold
Deliver the rapper sounds and bringing back to the golden age
So amazed how I go in focused, I can flow for days
Overcame a load of pain, smoking on that novocaine
Love and hate tend to fluctuate like its Oprah's weight
Motivated off of loads of hatred, yeah they mad at me
Game, set, match motherfucker, Mac Agassi
You ain’t in my tax bracket, homie, do work
Rapping as bad as Zack Galifianakis needs two ferns
All I need is some marley lean and the tallest trees
Let my dick show like I'm rocking Tally's jeans
That's something for the homies who won't follow me
Plus I'm on that Wu Tang rocking these Wallabees
I bomb atomically but you already heard that
Wanna be like Killa in a mink coat and fur hat
Pure rap with a new way to be real
Word to Cypress Hill, new rappers don’t need deals
Fuck a gun bullet spray, my speech kill
Plus my money tall, just to reach it you need stilts
I was a youngin' coming through on a three-wheel
Now I'm a motherfucking drug, here's a free pill
Go ahead try it out, have you crying loud
X-factor, I'm Simon Cowell, you Private Pal
So kill yourself boy you Vincent D'Onofrio
Full metal jacket bitch lock and loadThis is the first day of my life
Swear I was born right in the doorway
Went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach
Yours is the first face that I saw
Think I was blind before I met you
Don't know where I am
Don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go
So I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever, I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wonder if I could come home
Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning?
I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up
And you said, "This is the first day of my life
I didn't die before I met you
But now, I don't care, I could go anywhere with you
And I'd probably be happy"
So if you want to be with me
With these things, there's no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I'm working for a paycheck
Instead of waiting to win the lotteryI'm so high 
Find me somewhere in the sky 
And I know 
These days just flow by 
When you're so high 
Headed somewhere in the sky 
And you know 
These days just flow by 
When you're so high 
Yeah, my name is Mac Miller
And you are now living
The High Life
Most Dope
Big Jerm I see ya!

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah

You smell just like lilac wine, little bit of nostalgia
Rewind back time to when I first learned to love ya
She passin' me by, she burnin' rubber
These slideshows in my mind, whoa
She play it cool, but her eyes don't lie though 
If you wanna take a ride on the high road  
And your mind so passionate, your love what I'm after, and
That feelin' so unfamiliar, I only imagine it
Dream girl, you're my make-believe girl
I'ma bet it all on you, I'ma cheer you up
Why you bein' so blue? Yeah, I'ma put you in the mood
Baby girl, them butterflies stick like glue
Butterflies , butterflies stick like glue 
Butterflies , butterflies stick like glue
Yeah, okay
Beauty queen, beauty queen, straight out of a movie scene
Touchin' on yo' body, I could feel you in a lucid dream
This my imagination, ooh, you keep me fascinated
You are a forbidden fruit, I be apple tastin'
She is glowin', babe, I think I need a moment
I keep you open late, do you even know my name?
 Yeah
She dancin' on the street, it's her favorite ol' song
And she playin' out the stereo, the radio on
Do she love me like I love her? Use me when she need a lover?
Yeah, she got me under her spell, goin' rounds, ring a bell
I'ma bet it all on you, I'ma cheer you up
Why you bein' so blue? Yeah, I'ma put you in the mood
Baby girl, them butterflies stick like glue
Butterflies  
Butterflies stick like glue  
Butterflies  
Butterflies stick like glue 
There's no emotion powerful as love 
There's no emotion powerful as love 
There's no emotion powerful as love 
As love, as love 
Um, but really, Mac, you're kind of a bitch though
Just saying
Okay, byeLadies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today
To remember the life of many
What makes this world so cold?
People have to die before they even get old
Stories untold, hog with a ho
Tell the homies and the hoes to leave me alone
Cause I know that all I gotta do is stay focused, stay dedicated
I'm tryna get a bank with a better statement
And this is for the people said I'd never make it
And for the hoes who won't fuck me unless I'm famous
Mind educated by the world around it
Been elevated in the Himalaya mountains
So now I'm drinking from the fountain of life
They wonder "why this white boy stay sounding so nice?"
Maybe cause I was meant to speak the truth to em
Over melody, I'm in the booth flowing
With a pen and a pad and a glass of some gin
Me to music like this hat to a brim
Clean and simple, I can't be separated
You got a dream, but you scared and you yet to chase it
So you ain't going nowhere fast
Think you fresh cause your clothes got Polo tags?
I'm on a journey boy, I don't look back
Plus I'm fresher than a laundromat, now look at that
I can change the world on a Monday through a Friday
And turn around and get fly straight 5 days
Just gotta do this shit my way
You ain't an artist cause you got your own MySpace
Please don't waste my time
And if you got a lot of hobbies, don't say you grind
Cause you way behind, I'm on my way to shine
In a hurry, ain't taking my time
Cause I waited long enough, my time is now
All these bloggers online tryna find my style
"He a stoner, he don't know shit
Ain't a struggle in his life he gotta cope with"
I'm just telling you what's in my mind
Cause I'm finna be the best when I'm in my prime
Now they got the High Life playing in rewind
Say I'm something of a different kind...I guess
Homework must've slipped my mind
Where the fuck you find a young'un who can spit like I?
My button down shirt equipped with a tie
Cause boy, I'm on the business side
Young entrepreneur, no Diddy though
Who makes movies while you making home videos
I just wanna let my whole city know
That a young boy finna blow
You either with me or against me
The death of the emceeBack in the day, when it was a dream
Nobody believed in what I could be
But now I'm laughin' at 'em like, "Ha-ha-ha"
'Cause I'ma be okay
Back in the day, when it was a dream
Nobody believed in what I could be
But now I'm laughin' at 'em like, "Ha-ha-ha"
'Cause I'ma be okay
I used to have a dream, now it seem that I'ma live it in real life
Gettin' free jeans, good weed, feelin' real nice
Used to think that I was too short or too dumb
Just a newcomer to the game tryna do somethin'
Used to runnin' after ice cream trucks
But now I just stroll, lacе my Nikes up
I'm a nice, clean cut, good lookin' individual
Fillin' up a notebook with rhymes when I be in the school
Learn quick that nobody here invincible
We feel big, but in reality, we minuscule
Try and make a million bucks before I reach my pinnacle
Supernova status from basically invisible
Growin' up thinkin' it was cool to be a criminal
Until I saw a couple homies go down
See, now that isn't me or anything I'm finna be
I want the money, cars, hoes, clothes, a kid can dream
I used to talk to girls that wasn't even into me
Now they hit me up wantin' intimacy
But nah, I got a girl and she down for me
My little Juliet chillin' on the balcony
If I need it, she gon' run a hundred miles for me
Love me for me, not who I'm 'bout to be
And if they didn't believe, then I can do without 'em
'Cause at the end of the day I'm just Malcolm
Back in the day, when it was a dream
Nobody believed in what I could be
But now I'm laughin' at 'em like, "Ha-ha-ha"
'Cause I'ma be okay
Back in the day, when it was a dream
Nobody believed in what I could be
But now I'm laughin' at 'em like, "Ha-ha-ha" 
'Cause I'ma be okay 
Just a little snotty nose tryna find his pot of gold
Stayin' up late on the phone, always callin' hoes
Never thought I'd blow, no one took me serious
Now they see me walkin' down the street like, "Oh, there he is"
As a kid, anything was possible
But mama knows the hottest flow don't put me on the honor roll
Grades started slippin', the classes I be skippin'
Tried to tell me that I was a fool, I wouldn't listen, no
As a youngin' I was playin' pretend
My wonder years, never woulda thought they could end
Back, back in my glory days, way before the haze
A good night sleep had me energized for the day
When I would look up at the planets in they orbit
Before this life got distorted
Before the money was a plan
Before I ever thought that I would need to be a man
Somethin' like a Peter Pan, nah, I ain't tryna grow up
'Cause bein' old sucks, I just wanna go nuts
Before I drank a beer or ever took a hit of weed
When entertainment was my mom's readin' mysteries
Takin' you back to them nursery rhymes
When I thought the world just deserved to be mine
Said I'm takin' you back to them nursery rhymes
Back to the beginning, put the verse in rewind
Back in the day, when it was a dream
Nobody believed in what I could be
But now I'm laughin' at 'em like, "Ha-ha-ha"
'Cause I'ma be okay
Back in the day, when it was a dream
Nobody believed in what I could be
But now I'm laughin' at 'em like, "Ha-ha-ha"
'Cause I'ma be okay
Back in the day, when it was a dream
Nobody believed in what I could be
But now I'm laughin' at 'em like, "Ha-ha-ha"
I'm laughin' at 'em like, "Ha-ha-ha"
Haha, yeah
So this goes out to
Any of y'all, haha
That ain't tryna get old, hahaHaha
I'm on my shit right now, boy
That's me playin' the guitar too
Yeah, multi-talented, motherfucker
Haha, ayo, Jerm, I'm 'bout to go in, haha, uh
Yeah
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
My style's dumb, clownin' fools, hittin' the playground
Stuntin' is a habit, gotta stunt it if you have it
I be pumpin' out beats that leave you jumpin' like a rabbit
You a dipstick, doofus, numbnuts, nuisance
I'm too sick, doctors think the swine flu hit
Move with a groove like the moon man
Grab a lady if you wanna do a dance
If I'm here, who the fuck gon' monitor hell?
I keep a shorty on her knees, 'bout as tall as my belt 
[Laugh now, cry later, hi hater, I be gettin' it in
Got some shit to do and I'm in the mood
You wait a minute, I'ma get it again]
Uh
Comin' straight from the belly of the beast
Bringin' peace to your chi, we remember the deceased
Pour some liquor on the street
Hoppin' out the bed, the sun rise like east
Brush my teeth, I at least need to grab a bite to eat
Walk down the stairs, kiss my momma on the cheek
Before I walk up out the door, let my feet create a beat
On the street that I'm steppin' on, matter fact glidin'
Climbin' out the atmosphere to travel back from Zion
People look at me a different way
Now they listen when I got a little shit to say
Shit has changed since the old days when I was a youngin
Shit, I'm still a youngin' but I'm spittin' like it's nothin'
Would've thought I had a hundred years under my belt
And if you hatin', you just fuckin' yourself 
I'm the kid they call the life of the party
Glass of ice and Bacardi get me right so I'm probably
Swervin', I see you spittin' game and it's hurtin'
The precision of a surgeon when the hoes come in, searchin'
I'm just goin' with the flow like it's current
Watchin' my back for all you snakes and you serpents
Lurkin', jealous don't work and you selfish
Laughin' in your face and lightin' up the purple relish
Label me a man who make weed jams
Mad 'cause I'm writin' while I'm liftin' up a mountain with my free hand
You a little jackass, call you Wee Man
Nah, fuck that, I'ma call the weed manWhen will we die? This life isn't fair
I miss the high, I live a lie
And one day we'll die, no one will care
Take me inside, I'll meet you there
Am I alive? Am I aware?
Do you get high? Are we prepared?
And one day we'll die, no one will care
Do you get high? We will survive
Who do you think you are?
Young man, young man
Yeah
Man, I think you went too far
You can't stop the dance
Don't ever let 'em stop the dance, yeah
Are we all numb? Where are we goin'?
What have we become? It all keeps on rollin'
A little bit of light lets the hope grow
A lot goes on that they don't know
Just give me a sign, to show me somethin'
Is it my time? Can I stop runnin'?
Lost in the night and it's so cold
Forget the things that we don't know
I made my peace, can I go home?
Am I alive? Am I aware?
Do you get high? Are we prepared?
And one day we'll die, no one will care
Do you get high? We will survive
To the girl named Danger, so good to see you
Don't be a stranger, it's clear I need you
The angels will fall, not a saint after all
Back to the wall, let me free you
Protect me from evil, give me a reason
Where are the good people? Give us our freedom
Where are the dreamers?
Can you show me the dreamers?
And we are the creatures, prophets and teachers
We are believers, lost in amnesia
Will you let me fade away? I wanna fade away
Am I alive? Am I aware?
Do you get high? Are we prepared?
And one day we'll die, no one will care
Do you get high? We will surviveYo, P.A. to B.K
Skyzoo, Easy Mac, Pittsburgh to NYC
I love money, I love money 
 you take a buck from me, you Doug Funnie 
I said I love money, I love money 
You take a buck from me, better duck, dummy  
With my man Skyzoo  it's the class clown of his high school
Drown you in typhoons, hittin' you with rhyme too 
These haters keep they eyes glued, pound if you my dude 
We stay high like Einstein's IQ
And y'all ma'fuckers know where I'm comin from'
Chewin' cats up, like a lil' piece of bubblegum 
Tryin' double sum's, hustle, wanna let my money run
I ain't even battlin' dude, I'm having fun with 'im 
Jokes make him feel wrong in his own skin
Sippin' gin from a bin that's makin' my dome spin 
And you the type to try and take from your own kin
Feel it close on your toes, hangin' by clothes pins
I'm spittin blades, Goddamn it, my tooth hurts
A mouth filled with a bunch of cancerous tumors
Yup, music's my baby, I ain't gon' lose her
So I stay with a radio, like Cuba Gooding Junior 
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"
I'm one drink away from everything you meant to say
Like I think he on the rise to what the kings made
And in the blink of an eye I'm on the king's page
But no album, this is all off of the mixtapes, and
In a different lane, no signs of road rage
'Cause ain't nobody over here to rage wit', there's no gains
No sleep, no retreat, no surrender
No apologies from me, I'm the penner of the penners
I mean what I speak, so if I givin' you a sentence
Then it be's what it be's, nothing hid on the agenda
You leave it up to me, and you can divy up your team
Put your pride in the air and I'm dismembering your members
The heart of the city, the startin' point guard
That can play up to the fall, so the parts is all gone
No room on the bench and I got a no trade clause
So I'm here, long haul, no switchin'
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"
Yo, look, yo
I rip mics to pieces, cook 'em or eat 'em raw 
Was bustin' freestyles before I could read at all 
MCs just call me the monster in their mind
That'll haunt 'em all the time and they thought that if they rhyme
They could make the situation lil' different then the present 
See, I fucked this track, worried that I got it pregnant
I'm haulin' ass, y'all is whack, taking out the garbage, trash
Duckin' from these sharks and crabs, givin' MCs heart attacks
It's your boy Mac, damn, I'm great
And you gets no love like a man with AIDS
I fill you dancin' gays with some hand grenades
Drop bombs, remove your hands and legs
And I pray; dear Lord please give me the strength
Not put these little snakes in the tank 'til they faint
Suffocating, now you choke, you a broke MC
And there ain't nothing left to do but just smoke up your weed like...
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"
"Who you think could body me lyrically?"
"In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater"
"My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn"
"The pen game insane"Yeah
Yeah
Should probably start drinkin' more water
Yeah, I was
Sittin' in the basement, I just need a little motivation
Or a vacation, maybe just a little bit of patience
Made a couple million, what the fuck I'm still waitin' for?
This American hallucination, yeah
Wake up this American hallucination
Well, I feel liberated, fuck feelin' famous
Especially when you don't fuck with how the picture painted
Livin' in the matrix, digital ages
Can't believe this shit that everybody get away with
Yeah, and you call this shit sacred, yeah
Well, the opinion unpopular
Sittin' here zonin' to the image on the monitor
Young piece of shit, I'm from the 'Burgh though
Shadow Lounge birthed the legend, no award show needed
But I can tell you what the kids like
Feelin' when you little but the feelin' really big like
No, I never been the bitch type
Always down to give a little insight, yeah
I put it all in the music and live life
Hopin' that I did it right
Put it all in the music and live life
Fucked up, self destruct, that's kryptonite
We already move that dope
'Bout time to hit the road, go and do them shows
Get yourself a real woman, go and lose them hoes
Little chicken noodle soup for the soul
Yeah, it's all good
6:30 in the mornin'
And, it's all good
6:30 in the mornin'
Wake up, it's all good
6:30 in the mornin'
And it's, all good
Yeah
I am who I hate, but fuck that
Gettin' throat, she'll never know if I come back
Shit was all good when I loved rap
When they had me screamin', "Where the drugs at?"
Yeah, the most hated, all I know is greatness
Home runs, laps round the bases
Have a little fun, make faces
Make money, make changesYeah, well I'm, just being honest my conscience ain't doin' bad
Because I try to minus the problems that I attract
And half the time the wheels that's in the back of my mind just keep on turning 'til the tires flat and burn until the fire cracks
I do not lie, though facts may seem a little far-fetched
It's only 'cause I may be make believe and full of darkness when I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
Walk and droppin' change inside your empty guitar case, that charity, uh
I move carelessly, that's why I'm always trippin'
And yes I like electrolytes they help me go the distance
Not too efficient but the way it's always been
Until the day we have to meet again
Here to wait when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new, you'll get used to the bullshit, this room they gon' mess up
It's likely, they might be, but#"25/8"↗

ZDo you fear, that you'll have no control?
You walk through this world with your head above water
Shoes made of copper, just trying to float
The lakes frozen over, look down at yourself
What's staring back doesn't please you
The man don't believe you, he sees through the lies that you tell
Cards in your hand, you're looking at nothing
You wonder when God will just listen and give you a break
And he says, "See, living and dying are one and the same"
Do they dream just like we do?
Do they dream just like we do?
Do they love just like we do?
Do they love just like we do?
Do they feel just like we do?
Do they feel just like we do?
Do you know anything at all?
You've been waiting for answers as parades and dancers keep building your castle so strong
The moon made of water, you swim to the shore
You can try your best escape and the universe is breaking, you say you can't take it no more
The pressure is building like buildings you jumped from
Wishing that wishing could lift this conundrum
The streets that you walk on are shallow
But do you feel as big as your shadow?
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
No-oh-oh, oh-oh

Lean back with a laugh and half a smile
Wanna have a good time but I gotta hard grind
And I gotta go back right now
The way these people be loving

Every time I go out, out in the public
Feel like the boy got a lot of friends
Shit, I don't want to end bro
Be back up in the crib smoking, playing Nintendo
‘Cause me I’m try’n be up at the Grammys
Throwing parties in Miami
Round the bend of Venice Beach
Recognize me in the streets
With a hundred thousand women
Rocking all expensive linen
Living life like is a dream
I can't wait to be the king, shit
I don't want it to ever end
But for you bitches
It’s something I wouldn't recommend

Words rush out my mouth when it's my turn to bust
Try and challenge the battler you herbs get crushed
Cause you'll be smoked right away like the herb I puff
Steel City put your hand up the Burgh is us
Smoking purple stuff hold it down for the pot heads
Cross the cat he'll fill your body up with hot lead
I'm not saying what's not said before
Taking words out the book and I'm making metaphors
Cause I 
I gotta gotta gotta make money
Even if I gotta gotta gotta gotta take money
And it's what they take from me what I gotta do
Handle your business before I handle you
I gotta gotta gotta make money
Even if I gotta gotta gotta gotta take money
And it really ain't funny what I gotta do
Handle your business before I handle you
We all tryna be rich man it's all for the cash
Whether you slinging trees or moving 8 balls in the bag
Now from this jail cell where you calling your dad
Saying you dropping out of class and you following rap
So don't worry 'bout the cops dad I hate the feds
I'mma make it pops try not to hang your head
Cause I spit so sick that I should stay in bed
I'mma keep making rap till I'm laying dead
I'm collecting dollars, and quarters, and nickels, and dimes
My hat turned upside down while I'm kicking a rhyme
I'm sitting reclined you claim real but you all sound fake
All for the money, fam, all for the pound cake
And when I get rich I won't forget about my family
I'll be spreading money all throughout the whole family tree
The words I speak with herbs and trees about the currency
I gotta make money before the dollar bill murder me
I gotta gotta gotta make money
Even if I gotta gotta gotta gotta take money
And it's what they take from me what I gotta do
Handle your business before I handle you
I gotta gotta gotta make money
Even if I gotta gotta gotta gotta take money
And it really ain't funny what I gotta do
Handle your business before I handle you
This is my biography
It's really something that you've gotta read
You all are weak words the make me fall asleep
Dime nots please can you drop the beat
I gotta gotta gotta make money
Even if I gotta gotta gotta gotta take money
And it's what they take from me what I gotta do
Handle your business before I handle you
I gotta gotta gotta make money
Even if I gotta gotta gotta gotta take money
And it really ain't funny what I gotta do
Handle your business before I handle youHey, hahaha
I'm all grownsed up, man
Yeah, ha
Alright, look, hey
I'm so drunk, it's a bad idea to talk
'Cause I ain't makin' any sense, I'm just here to rock
Not sleepin', all grown up
Now the places that we go, they know us
Tell me, "Mac, it's so good to see you blow up"
'Cause now I be with cheese like cold cuts
And I ain't dealin' with a ho got no butt
Gotta do more than chillin', just show up
I'm just out my mind
Stay dealin' with some girls who be out all the time
And the higher that I get on this mountain I climb
To the clouds, I'ma rise over balcony, shine
From the light of the sun, tonight'll be fun
'Cause the night is still young and the rhyme to the drum
Is flowin', an island
See the ocean when I'm chillin', got me smilin', like
"Ayy", tonight will be great
Walkin' through the door with a smile on my face
Like hate me or love me
Chase dreams, ain't worried 'bout money
I'ma get it then spend it, the way it's gon' be
And you ain't know me if you ain't part of the team
If you ain't part of the team
You ain't know me if you ain't part of the team, like

Hey, hey 
Ayy, tonight will be great 
Walkin' through the door with a smile on my face
Like hate me or love me 
Chase dreams, ain't worried 'bout money 
Too many people always thought I wouldn't ever do shit
I'm ruinin' my life and I'll never get rich
Forever I'm this, never goin' back
Don't fade to black, I'ma stain the map
Yeah, I'm changin' rap and my name is Mac
Trust me, then I'm ready when the cameras flash
'Cause the boy got presents like Santa's bag
Travel everywhere, homie, Alabama and back
My fans in the back in the stand and they clap
Give me love all day so I'm handin' it back
They believe, so they family
I'm ready right now, kinda antsy
And I don't got nothin' like a plan B
Just go and cop a crib in Miami
Get a Grammy and a Oscar

In the ocean, get to swimmin' or drown 
How long has it been since you smiled? 
Girl, I love the way your body fit inside that gown 
Her mama was a lady bug, her papa was an atheist
Workin' on a novel set in Cold War Romania 
Chasin' love, idolizin' Joan of Arcadia
Pray the landscapers don't wake her up 
I'ma slave to the bass line
Conversation topic got us tangled in the grape vine
Still wide awake I'm, a stranger to the daytime
Vampire, higher than a hang glider
Look around and all I see is great skies 
There's help inside that medicine cabinet 
Came in for the answers, but she left with a habit 
There's no one on the other end of that telephone 
Lets fall asleep to the metronome, yeah 
She's fallin' for her hallucinations
What's love without imagination? Yeah
Baby, don't let them tell you what's real and what's not
There's a paradise waiting on the other side of the dock, whoa
It's only real if it's real to you
It's only real if it's real to you, it's only real if it's real to you
Yeah
Tell me, is it real if you can't hold it in your arms
But it can touch you?
Feel this texture pressin' up against your chest
You say, "I love you" 
Fallin' victim to a world that's filled with satire
Mark Twain admired
Open Tom Sawyer, read a passage to the cab driver
She only in the back seat of a taxi 'cause her car is in the shop with a flat tire
Mom says she believe her, but she always been a bad liar
Had a plan to burn her past, but it backfired
Hold on and be strong, kneel before your king
The land you put your knees on
It won't be long 'til your path finds ya
And if love is just a fantasy
Then what's the problem if you fall in love with fantasy?
In the waitin' room for psychiatric evaluation
She doesn't have the patience to be treated like a patient
It'll be okay, if she just swallow this pill
She's fallin' for her hallucinations
What's love without imagination? Yeah
Baby, don't let them tell you what's real and what's not
There's a paradise waiting on the other side of the dock, whoa
It's only real if it's real to you
It's only real if it's real to you, it's only real if it's real to you
Havin' conversations, with friendly hallucinations
I'll be havin' conversations, with friendly hallucinations
They don't need no explanation, there is beauty in creation
My Lord
Havin' conversations, with friendly hallucinations
I'll be havin' conversations, with friendly hallucinations

Days, days, days
Days, days
So who's that lady with her picture painted on my everything?
And what is she trying to say now?
I could probably spend my time thinking all about some better things
I've been floating for so long, think I'm ready to drown
Said I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
Yeah I'm going down, down, down, down, down, down
I'm in way over my head these 
I'm in way over my head most 
I'm in way over my head most 
I'm in way over my head most 
I'm in way over my head most 
Most 
Most 
Most 
I'm sticking to deprive 'em of it all
Something beautiful to brace my fall
Gotta find a melody
Gotta guide some memories
And don't believe in what they say
A predator will find his prey
Close your eyes and run around
They comin' now to hunt you down
And can open up the blinds let the light in, please
I get kind of tired of fighting
We need make love, we need to make love
Days, days
This is confusion, confusion
This confusion, confusion
There's a confusion, confusion
There's a confusion, confusion
There's confusionWhat you gonna do when the people go home
And you wanna smoke weed but the reefer's all gone
And somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out the doobie ashtray
Why they do me that way
What you gonna do when ya friends go home
And you wanna drink a beer but ya ends all gone
Somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out my doobie ashtray
Why they do me that way?
I'm making the final decisions that could somehow make a nigga vision come true
Then I'mma give the game a one two
For now I tell the homies come through
Politicin while we chillin planing how to make a million
Got the features of a ceiling, I'm high
Can't seem to figure out the formula
When I do I'm warning ya
Success I swear I'm on to ya
Joining fake friends on a journey to make Henz his attorney
I can't when these niggas clowns like Bert and Ernie
My attorney handles all the bull
Niggas try to stop me in the game, I'm on my Manning shit
Now watch me call the audible
You can gather all the pool and all the fucking tour and niggas still wouldn't be the shit to me
I'm reaching out for a position Big ain't get to see
Give these hatin niggas the trigger, kill em with creative figure
As I make my homies leave, devote my time to playin it back
I look around the crib then all a sudden then I'm mad
Because
What you gonna do when the people go home
And you wanna smoke weed but the reefer's all gone
And somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out the doobie ashtray
Why they do me that way
What you gonna do when ya friends go home
And you wanna drink a beer but ya ends all gone
Somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out my doobie ashtray
Why they do me that way?
I like this... Dee Goodz...what's good
So put ya shit out in the doobie ashtray
While the ganja burning slow and we moving that way
And my crew got mad haze, enough that we can share with you
I'm brand new, you could use a repair or two
The weed smoke impair my view, the color of it very blue
You could smoke up with the Most Dope homie very few
Huffin and puffin, the bud in the oven you coughin and we love it and breaking it down
Who be the man with a doobie in hand, calling the kid to bring it around
Life is hard so we smoke away the stress
Without my Mary Jane I'mma mess
So I gotta keep it fresh, grab a zip and nothing less
You can come smoke too cause I love a bunch of guests, yes
Marijuana dreams, Californiacation
Take a couple hits before I have to board this plane and
Stop complaining, just give me my weed back
Find me where the trees at, I'm just tryna relax
What you gonna do when the people go home
And you wanna smoke weed but the reefer's all gone
And somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out the doobie ashtray
Why they do me that way
What you gonna do when ya friends go home
And you wanna drink a beer but ya ends all gone
Somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out my doobie ashtray
Why they do me that way?Incom—, incom—, incom—, incom—, incompatible
It don't matter though
'Cause someone's bound to hear my cry
Speak out if you do
You're not easy to find
They say I ain't ready for the game 
Well, that's a shame 
If you hatin', you can exit in your lane 
They jealous 'cause everybody mentionin' my name 
And all these other rappers, every sentence mean the same
But I'm spittin' with a diagnosed infection in my brain 
It sound crazy with this educated slang 
So go ahead, keep your change
They say I don't belong here 
Try and cut me out the field like a John Deere
I'm incompatible, probably 'cause I'm valuable 
Lend me your ears with no collateral
If you don't give a fuck about me, everything cool
'Cause I don't give a fuck about you
Go and do what you do 
Leave me to my music
Yeah, this can be your life if you choose it 
I'm just doin' my part to write the history books
So why do all these other rappers keep givin' me looks?
 Incompatible 
It don't matter though 
'Cause someone's bound to hear my cry
Speak out if you do, you're not easy to find 
Incompatible 
It don't matter though 
Uh, with all these expectations peakin'
They wonder what I'm 'bout to do 
Sparked interest, music, I can count on you, right? 
Or do I have it all twisted? 
I went from popular to misfit in an instant
My friends forgot me 'cause they probably see me hardly 
Always in the lab when I should be out at a party 
It drive me crazy, and money is the fuel 
Insomniac, awake, findin' somethin' I can do
To put the work in and I'm certain that I'm flirtin' with the fame
For failure gettin' jealous, throwin' dirt upon my name
It's burnin' up my brain but I'm workin' through the pain
'Cause life's hard 'til you learn it's just a game
Play your cards, use your letters on your Scrabble board 
If you smart, put your heart into your rappin' more 
No money? Why the fuck you countin' for? 
A thousand chores, tryna get up my allowance more

Back when I didn't know myself 
I thought I needed so much help 
I wasn't yet grown, couldn't do it on my own
"I'ma make it," what I told myself 
Oh, how alone I felt 
Now they mouth right below my belt
Tell 'em they can go to hell
'Cause this shit just me, don't need no one else 
My records like phones, they sell 
No, I'm not done in this ring, better hold that bell 
Gimme a break of that Kit-Kat bar 
Who that famous bitch in that car? 
Everybody run they mouth about somebody
You'da thought God said, "Fuck bitches, get money" 
Can we get a amen, and a milk and a honey?
Shit's real, how you feel? How you feel? Do you love me? 
So let's get electric, majestic
Infected with sex and depressants
This fresh shit the best, just accept it
I've dealt with rejection, a lesson that I've learned 
All this hatred, I lack concern
'Cause I've waited long enough, it's my turn 
Now lift that ass up, you want that match-up, you had to burn 
I do the work the universe assign me 
Who's the first to brew the human cure?
You disturbed she'll get peculiar
I was bringin' out juice into Troubadour
Excuse me, sir, I don't know who you confuse me fer 
'Cause the raps colder than Jupiter 
 Huge berserk, go the distance, Moon to Earth 
Pluto's still a planet
Pluto's still a planet, if you ask me
Flow is crafty, no one's gonna catch me
Where are my idols? Now they old and saggy
Some of these rappers, dontcha know your daddy?
Know I'm batshit, go and blow an addy
Hoes is laughin' up in the backseat, shut they asses up, this ain't no taxi 
Throw an alley-oop in, all I do is make music 
I don't take a break, been four days awake
Dedication, no bullshit 
The sky the limit, we roofless 
Don't got time for excuses 
Chasin' pussy so stupid
Swear to god I'ma die in this booth, shit 
What’s a Judist to Confucius? 
What’s a Judist to Confucius? 
Yeah, I'm sick of dodgin' these bullets 
And watchin' all of my movements 
As a kid, was so foolish, but I'm no longer a student
I still believe in dragons 
I still believe in dragons 
Yeah, this shit right here is so sacred 
Never lettin' 'em take it 
Fuck your problems, everyone got 'em
Let's go to space and get faded 
It's 'bout time you respect the genius 
'Bout time everybody pledge allegiance 
Thin-skinned rappers have flesh anemic
Give 'em homicide, tell 'em, "Rest in pieces"
Imitators emulatin' TMZ shit 
Ride the wave 'til they gettin' sea sick 
In a league that they can't compete with
Nobody give a fuck who the second team is
Like a broken record, all these broken records
I'm immature though, I don't know no better
I'm at home watchin' episodes of Becker
With a cup of coco and a polo sweater
I'm only gettin' better, breathin' fire
Smokin' on a tenner, keep me higher
My flow, the loss of temper, easy violence
Death before surrender, no survivors
What’s a Judist to Confucius? 
What’s a Judist to Confucius? 
Yeah, this shit right here is so sacred

Some people people, people people, people people, people people, people people, people ohh
Said, people love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinking 'bout her all the time
I've never seen somebody put together perfectly, said
What would I have to do to call you mine, said
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes or you can walk it blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you don't you worry
Listen to me, I'mma set you free, said
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend, said
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away, can you hide away
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange, how the times have changed
But I wish, we could go and be free
Once, baby, you and me
I said, Salt Lake City put your hands in the air like this
And never come back again
And leave it all in the rear view, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Leave it all in the rear view, girl
Siad, you don't have to cry
*humming*
Can you, can you
Mend a broken heart girl if you can, said
Don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
And that responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please, give me the chance to go and live again
I'm having some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable, said
Don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't a need to go and kill yourself, though
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all, yeah
I wish the truth would just reveal itself, said
Who do you call to make it to the top
And who do you call to make the shooting stop
And who do you call to give the coup a wash?
After everything I did I think I'm still myself
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away, can you hide away
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange, how the times have changed
But I wish, we could go and be free
Once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
Towards the air like this, let's go
Leave it all in the rear view
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
Leave it all in the rear view, yeah oh-oh-oh
It's in the rear view
Said, you don't have to cry
*humming*
Said, thanks y'all for coming out tonight
I hope you get home alright
I'm sorry we kept y'all waitin'
But this has been the Space Migration
And if you want to leave, said
Right there's the door
But if you stick around for just another minute\we might have a little bit more
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh
Girl it's only you
Have it your way
If you want you can decide
And if you'll have me I can provide everything you can desire

:
Life a bitch that I wanted to date, but just led me on
Now I’m going for another one
Put me in the friend zone, loving how we get along
But she wouldn’t let me fuck her once
You got to take life for what it is
But everybody just tell us that we a bunch of kids
This shit ain’t nothing big, it’s just the game of life
So motherfucker how you playing?
:
In this game of life, I’m just beginning
Only the first inning, but how much they paying to get admission
Oh nothing?
They just listening?
It’s all good, cause I’m just trying to make a living
This planet that we living on
Streets people spitting on
Got this cold world in my hand, I put some mittens on
They playing dirty so my bib is on
Why they hating on the stars that they wish upon?
Twinkle, twinkle, a wrinkle in time
I got these motherfuckers hating cause they wish they could shine
But they can't and I can
So they stand while I dance, with their bitch
With my hands on her hips and she ask me
“Can you take me to the crib?” 
Well bitch that wouldn’t be too classy
I’m sick of all the same advice
Motherfucker this the game of life
So how you playing?
:
Life a bitch that I wanted to date, but just led me on
Now I’m going for another one
Put me in the friend zone, loving how we get along
But she wouldn’t let me fuck her once
You got to take life for what it is
But everybody just tell us that we a bunch of kids
This shit ain’t nothing big, it’s just the game of life
So motherfucker how you playing?
:
It ain’t smart, I’m playing risky in this game of life
Roll the dice, just trying to get my paper right
When the heat’s on, most of yall made of ice
So you pay the price, but I’m here to save your life
You the type to never ever take advice
The world is a girl who ain’t playing right
Everybody love life cause it sound nice
But you can’t turn a ho into a housewife
Everybody tried but they failed
Oh well, light another L 
I guess the show goes on
You had her naked, now her clothes is on
What’s wrong?
:
Life a bitch that I wanted to date, but just led me on
Now I’m going for another one
Put me in the friend zone, loving how we get along
But she wouldn’t let me fuck her once
You got to take life for what it is
But everybody just tell us that we a bunch of kids
This shit ain’t nothing big, it’s just the game of life
So motherfucker how you playing?It's what he said after the Grammy's

With half the establishment on my pinky finger
Buzzin' off two dozen bars, I give 'em stingers

What would I do with a million dollars?

Cop a Phantom, just to ride in
Some celebrity friends to get high with
Couple foreign models that I fine dine with

Nobody ever taught you how to dance?
Well, well, everyone knows how to dance
There's only so much time
Yeah, somebody died today, I
I saw his picture in the funny papers
Didn't think anybody died on a Friday
Some angry banker, some kind of money trader
Recently divorced, was drunk drivin' down the highway
And drove off the bridge to his wedding song
Blew out the bass in his speakers, you can still hear the treble goin'
The hospital was useless, and everything was quiet but the music
Recently, I only meet peace when in deep sleep
Been the same dream: world safe, smile on her face
Waitin' on the other side, I wonder if he'll tend to the other side
Yeah, what your eyes see, too naive for war, and that'll screw ya
Still bet it all on the glory, hallelujah
I heard the answer in the gibberish of an old drunk
All he said was he's in no rush
If I could just pay my rent by Tuesday
I bet I'd be rich by April Fools' day
The moon's wide awake, with a smile on his face
As he smuggle constellations in his suitcase
Don't you love silence?
Everything quiet but the music, everything quiet but the music
Do you love silence?
Everything quiet but the music
Somebody gave birth to a baby boy
I saw his picture in the funny papers
11 pounds, named after his uncle Gabriel
His mother cried with her lips against his soft face
Watch him bring these bright eyes into this dark place
Oh, sweet, sweet oblivion
Way before the information gets settled in
I swear to God I never wanna sin again
But I fear that 
Yeah, the mind go with age, don't surrender
My mistake, I misplaced all of my remembers
Baby, there's a little vacation in the dresser
Take one for depression, and two for your temper
If I could just pay my rent by Tuesday
I bet I'd be rich by April Fools' day
The moon's wide awake, with a smile on his face
As he smuggle constellations in his suitcase
Don't you love silence?
Oh shit, here come the icebreaker
It's danger when he's bringin' out the lightsaber
The words awesome but he's talkin' outta turn often
I blew the fuck up, then became the world's problem
Bad hygiene, all about that gross life
Hate to see somebody fuckin' up their own life
Just roll the dice, put a 20 on midnight
Have a feelin' we gon' win tonight
'Cause when the snakes start slitherin', you spot the chameleons
You realize you surrounded by reptilians
Shit, I ain't an innovator, just a motherfuckin' illustrator
Why does it matter, at all? Whoa, whoaIf only you guys knew what just happened in here
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can you turn the beat up a little bit, yeah
Turn my headphones up
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well who is he? I be ze meanest, putting Jesus pieces on a fetus
The Lord taketh, then he keepeth one of many masterpieces
I'm rolling up the weed and feasting on gravidas
Your bitch a junkie, always sucking on somebody's penis
Ooh, I'm eating General Tso's chicken off the fine china
I put my dick inside your bitch and say the "Our Father"
Young Moses part water
Head wraps car bomber
Death trap dark slider
Jump on motherfucker, got ya, once I dropped ya

Do not try to stop cause you not gon' fuck with him
I'm rumbling with countrymen, do it for the USA
First you get the money, then the fame, then you get paid

And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop
I'm sipping liquor 'til my liver pop
And playing tennis with cinder blocks, I'm in the spot
Chilling with some nympho THOTs, landed on the Planet Rock
Man of God, hammerhead shark in human camoflauge
Duck down I'm on, understand the planet's strong
Lead singer came with Keith Richards, brought the band along
I'm pretty Zen lady, headspin is 1080
They say that I went crazy but love me when the check cleared
Red beard, seen into the future, fear the end near
Bitch I want it all, I will not give you not a cent here
This is not pretend, I'm trying to pay some pricy rent here
It's no words, selling Goldberg and you gon' get speared
Do the most, I'm the host and the special guest here
It's a fucking party started, everybody get weird
Take your pants off, move your body, you can dance around
I got you shitting in your pants, you wearing Pampers now
Mean flow, hitting free throws, shoot 'em granny style
Came a long way from rocking hand-me-downs, fr-fr-fresh
I said the world is just a big gazebo, so baby let's get married in it
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop

Spent a lot of days in this game 'fore I ran it 
When the money gone, hoes vanish
 We ain't in Kansas no more 
Bitches won't stop callin' my line
But I'm too busy turnin' water to wine
Lot on my mind, type of things happen all of the time
You gotta get yours, but me, I gotta get mine
Homie, I made it from the basement to
Gettin' faded on stage with Snoop

Popped out of my mother placenta with a crown on
Got a new bitch, keep the frown on
She tell me I need to grow up
I tell her she need to get on my level and show respect to the motherfucker that's cuttin' the check
She ain't gonna be around long and that's fine
For now we naked on the couch, watchin' movies with the sound on this time
But never mind, that's another story
For a better time, when it's better for me
Cold dough burger, shit is 40

But, I felt like I haven't slept, in a while
Yeah
Forever invincible with the infinite flow
Crackin' the DaVinci code, I play the game on difficult
Could've been the G.O.A.T, but I blew it like a piccolo
My bitch alone in the bed, she feelin' miserable
I got my flaws too, locked inside this dark room
And I ain't no photographer, I'm something like a carpenter
Full of broken promises, I said I'd build a rocket for
Her to fly away in but she'd never come back
Lord knows that she's hard to faze, got a soft spot for her
She agitated in this maze, I am lost for words
You don't need binoculars to see the monikers
Gettin' popular, it feels a bit twisted, word to Oliver
Lyin' pathologically, smile at the comedy
I only sleep with a song playin' on repeat
Tryna do the right thing, I hope that poppy sees
Girl, lovin' you is all I really need
Girl, don't be scared of your nightmares
You can close your eyes, I'll be right there
I ain't perfect, but I'm learning
The firewood stay burning all night
And don't give up, things will be alright
Come and dance with me like it was prom night
It's one-thousand eight-hundred twenty days I count
That me and you been playing house 
I still remember making out on Jenny's couch
You gave me one more kiss before you let me out
Couldn't spend a day without each other, wouldn't separate
Lost in conversation, having sex could wait a week or two
In my daddy's car, talking 'til the sun came up
You slept at your moms but you text me when you wake up
Quickly came love, the pain led to break ups
You hated it, it made you sick, every time I take drugs
It's all my fault, over-dramatic, always actin' suicidal
You call me on my lies though
If love were a religion, you wrote the Bible
Wanna grow old together and watch the time go
And I would give it all back
Before I lost you again, no, I don't want that
Just wait for me, let me take my time
I'm all yours, baby, rain or shine, yeah
Girl, don't be scared of your nightmares
You can close your eyes, I'll be right there
I ain't perfect, but I'm learning
The firewood stay burning all night
And don't give up, things will be alright
Come and dance with me like it was prom night
It's one-thousand eight-hundred twenty days I count
That me and you been playing house 
I know the thought of forever is kinda scary
But, baby, we should get married
Give you a baby you can carry
Our love will never be ordinary
Can you pour one more Bloody Mary?
Can you pour one more Bloody Mary?
One moreYeah
Let me crack open my High Life real quick 
Product placement, haha
Uh, uh, let's go
Let's take it to the top now, to the top now, baby

Through rain, sleet, snow, I'ma keep gettin' dough
You can find me on my grind
So put your muthafuckin' hands in the sky
And if you sittin' down, please stand 
'Cause I'm on the rise and I reside in this castle made of sand 
Let me get a hand clap, I'ma make an entrance 
Givin' y'all the lecture, then I'm takin' questions
My soul a sword, write a sentence, make a weapon
Swimmin' in the deep end, you bitches takin' lessons 
Then I hear you hatin' on the boy
Well, I ain't offended 
'Cause I'm the captain of the team and y'all play the benches 
Still breakin' it down, to rollin' it up
Put an eighthy in the blunt, then I'm smokin' a Dutch
But talk hoes, know I stay with a few
But they replace like the lace in my shoe
So tell me, what a player to do
When bein' real don't appeal to the player in you 
I've seen some whack cats fast track to the fame
To me, it sound like some clowns rappin' the same
And we, we all livin' for the same thing 
Just to make it to the top and remain king 
Let's take it to the top now, to the top now, baby
I'ma take my time
Through rain, sleet, snow, I'ma keep gettin' dough
You can find me on my grind 
So put your muthafuckin' hands in the sky 
And if you sittin' down, please stand 
'Cause I'm on the rise and I reside in this castle made of sand 
And you can't name a single youngin' with a flow like mine
Got bars like soap and I glow like shine
If you think that I'm whack, you might change your mind
'Cause I got them punchlines that stain like wine 
Let me take my time, collect my thoughts
Keep it fresh like shoes when they kept in the box 
Connect all the dots, I'm fresh, so clean
Stay pinchin' myself 'cause I'm livin' in a dream 
Believe, I ain't never gonna stop
Find a new spot, then I set up my shop 
When I drop, your wifey gon' cop that 
And haters gettin' shaken out they jockstraps 
Some say I'm bringin' hip-hop back
While others say I'm all up on that pop-rap 
Team captain, control the game
Goin' hard 'til every single person knows my name
Let's take it to the top now, to the top now, baby 
I'ma take my time
Through rain, sleet, snow, I'ma keep gettin' dough
You can find me on my grind 
So put your muthafuckin' hands in the sky 
And if you sittin' down, please stand 
'Cause I'm on the rise and I reside in this castle made of sand 
To the top now, to the top now, baby

Mac Miller
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Big Jerm over there on the switches
TreeJ over there just smokin' on the weed
AhaYeah, yeah
She breaks down the pain
Yeah
She breaks down the pain, she rolls up the weed
She far from a saint, she's all that I need
She lost in her thoughts, so hardly she speaks
Her mind's always dirty and her soul's never free 
She never been a groupie 
She just in love with the music
She watch depressin' movies 
Somethin' from the '30s or the '40s about a dependent house wife 
She makes up her bed like she makes up her stories
Awake through the night, then she high from the morning
I wish she could feel me, she never felt nothin'
Knock on her door, she let me come in 
I wish she would learn to live
Isolation, she lockin' the bathroom door
Baby, let's get stoned
Put on a record, can I play you one more song?
We can get stoned
I swear to God, heaven feels just like home
Let's go home
Yeah
And the water, it's shallow like the lies that she tells
Can't run from your shadow, can't hide from yourself
She hates that she cries when she's all by herself
And she's always all by herself 
She hardly talks in conversation 
But, but when she do, all the words get lost in translation 
No, she can't move 
'Cause she paralyzed from the fear that she fantasized
The doctor tried to analyze
They can not find anything that's wrong with her
Her parents never got along with her
I had to make this song for her 
I wish she would learn to live
Isolation, she lockin' the bathroom door
Baby, let's get stoned
Put on a record, can I play you one more song?
We can get stoned
I swear to God, heaven feels just like home
Let's go home
Baby, let's get stoned
Put on a record, can I play you one more song?
We can get stoned
I swear to God, heaven feels just like home
Let's go home
I wish she would learn to live
Isolation, she lockin' the bathroom door
Baby, let's get stoned
Put on a record, can I play you one more song?
We can get stoned
I swear to God, heaven feels just like home
Let's go homeYo, yo, that Cali dro'
Whoa, and I’m good to go
Single pack of duchy-palmer’s and them niggas getting blow
Yo, shorty drop it low, and she started getting dough
She saying that she sell a bit, but God know she’s still a ho
Yo, is you feeling me?
Yeah, yeah I’m chilling B
Puffing on that perk, nigga I can feel it killing me
We opened up the bag of white and then it started spilling keys
And I stay high like a credit card billing fee
I’m killing these faggots that be grilling me
Blunt full of realest trees, and nobody as real as me
Supply the man, how I’m flipping, moving all the scrill on trees
Niggas talk, blowing out their necks like a guillotine
I’m in love with this bud
With this bud
With this bud
I think I’m in love with this bud
With this bud
With this bud
With this bud
It’s what you want, ha, it’s what you need 
You got the blunt, I got the weed
You got the soil , I got the seed 
Yo, you want to smoke? 
Yes, indeed
High as hell, fly as well, come on, homie, try to sell
Got that stinky kush that make you cry when you try and smell
Like an onion, youngin'
Marijuana lovin', see, we share, always care, so we pass it while we puffing
This bud make me hover like a mother board space ship
Roll a swish, filled with fresh piff, then I face it
I can’t feel my face like I’m faceless
All dressed up, getting Mary Jane wasted
Have you ever smoked bud in the club, when you puff till the nights gone
Eyes so red, that I had to put my sights on
In an L, out the bong, in a spliff, out the bowl
Yeah that stinky kush, so you know you got to have some more
I’m in love with this bud
With this bud
With this bud
I think I’m in love with this bud
With this bud
With this bud
With this budYeah, can you feel it?
Yeah
It take a little bit of practice 
Get lost in the madness, world keep spinnin' on the axis 
Risen from the ashes 
Overthrew the king, now I'm feelin' high, shittin' on the palace 
Wishin' on a miracle, livin' on a prayer 
Open up ya third eye, see what's really there 
Wait, you can taste the freedom in the air
Give thanks, based beings, we the rarest 
Yeah, you starin' at an illusion 
I don't need shit, I'm my own Rick Rubin 
Burnin' down ya city, have a concert on the ruins 
Go home, release all the little homies who in Shuman 
I'm goonin', this music comin' out the coop kachooin' 
Super loose, start to hula hoop with Paul Newman 
Say, "Fuck it," and keep it movin' 
Can't stop the revolution 
We either choose or get chosen, confusion, commotion
Turn out the lights and the pools turn to oceans 
Yeah, this the end of the world as we know it
Said, there ain't no heaven for somebody like me
Let it all burn in the blunt of my weed
Wonder what it must be like when it all seem right 
Said, does it feel good? 
Afraid you might fall when you're up this high 
Uh, said
Take you to maximum velocity 
Have to wait for man to recognize God in me 
I offer no apologies, honestly 
I'm 'bout to start smackin' motherfuckers in the face just for comedy 
As my sanity slip, 'cause there ain't much danger, it's as vanity is 
Somebody asked me what my fantasy is
I smiled and told 'em, "Hand me a bitch" 
Lord, can it be this? And if it isn't, can you grant me a wish?
If I never see heaven, let me sample its bliss
I get high to get by 'cause inside of my mind is a mess
All the stress that I find is a blessin' in disguise
'Cause we fall, then we rise, to learn it's my turn
Let me go, it's my time, let 'em know that I'm on now 
Pittsburgh, we on now , whoa
Said, there ain't no heaven for somebody like me
Let it all burn in the blunt of my weed
Wonder what it must be like when it all seem right
Said, does it feel good?
Afraid you might fall when you're up this high 
Said, there ain't no heaven for somebody like me
Let it all burn in the blunt of my weed
Wonder what it must be like when it all seem right
Said, does it feel good?
Afraid you might fall when you're up this high Yeah
Never had a lot, but I made a lot
They told a story, I changed the plot
Now I'm savin' up for that plane or yacht
Them extra channels, that cablebox, yeah
I'm faithful to that cablebox
That money good, but that pain is not
They said, "Damn, you changed a lot," but
They don't know my bitch's name
Said, they don't know my bitch's name
And I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe

And I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe, whoa, whoa
What's your life like?
She'll come back for the right price
Might blind you with them bright lights
No one wanna be Christ-like
Shit too hard, still wanna figure out who you are
The drugs in my system, they worried I took it too far, but
But-but I built this, mo-motherfucker, I built this, and
And along the way I never made a kill switch, 'cause
'Cause I won't stop 'til my heart give, and stop tickin' like a old clock
They knock, knock, knock, knock, my door lock
It won't open up for no one 
My head up, I keep goin'
They thinkin' I should slow up 
Explode, I been shakin' up the soda
Hol' up , this mine, don't touch
They see my white skin, eyes lit up, they sayin', "Gold rush"
I'm, still eatin' breakfast, some Cocoa Puffs
I can't sleep, my eyes just won't shut 
My mom thinks I'm doin' too much 
She say, "Slow down, don't rush" 
Never had a lot, but I made a lot
They told a story, I changed the plot
Now I'm savin' up for that plane or yacht

Said, they don't know my bitch's name, no, no
And I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe
I don't mean to hurt your feelings, babe, whoa, whoa
I'm, wakin' up from this coma
Called her on the mobile phone
Askin' her if she's goin' home
Or she's still sleepin' over
I mighta lost my fragile soul
I could probably use a loaner
No emotion, playin' poker
Once I moved to California
She lost a lot of that trust in me
Can't say she don't get a rush when she fuckin' me
Subsequently I'm prayin' to a angel
Where did all the pain go?
So unstable, the cocaine is on the table
Girl, let's take off, let's get out of here
Goin', goin', a different atmosphere awaits us
I tend to talk a lot and you don't say much
But everything I say just ain't enough, no
Say I need to let that love show
You knock me down so fast, I'm gettin' up slow
Yeah, everything ain't perfect
Standin' there on judgment day, like was it all worth it? Uh
Never had a lot, but I made a lot
They told a story, I changed the plot
Now I'm savin' up for that plane or yacht
Them extra channels, that cablebox, yeah
I'm faithful to that cablebox
That money good, but that pain is not

But I'm ready for the next stage 
Just text me, she said I hit it out the park like Fenway 
Ayy, it's just one night's work
Have her stayin up late, then sleepin' in my shirt
Girl, I gotta leave now, I need to get to work
I'm a young heartbreaker, believe me, it's a curse 
But hey, I stay focused 'cause the money come first
Take my real life situations, throw 'em in a verse 
Uh, that's the formula for the truth
It's more than just what I do, I'm explorin' it for the proof 
Who am I? Muhfucker, who are you?
Don't be askin' questions you should know the answer to 
You should know my name, don't forget me
'Bout to takeover the game, I'm ready
We stay fly , new clothes on 
Smokin' on that drake 'til I'm so far gone
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
Baby girl, you fly , why we gotta wait? 
Let's take a drive, I need to get away
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
Uh, yeah
I'm ready to have the glory, I'm ready to have the name
I'm ready to have the fortune, I'm ready to have the fame
When I get up in the game, it's never gon' be the same
Those too dumb to notice, tell 'em to use they brain 
I spend a whole day on the cloud
Firetrucks comin' through tryin' get me down
Mom say she proud 'cause I'm stickin' to my dreams
Get myself out, head to bigger, better things 
It's the high life, boy, I live the fly life
Honey's want my number 'cause I rhyme nice, haha
Ain't that some shit?
She gave her girl a camera, said, "Can we take a pic?" 
So let us speak a thousand words
Shorty says she want me 'cause I'm down to Earth 
It's all gravy, you won't forget me
'Cause I'm headed to the top, I'm ready
We stay fly , new clothes on 
Smokin' on that drake 'til I'm so far gone
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
Baby girl, you fly , why we gotta wait? 
Let's take a drive, I need to get away
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm readyUh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh
I came through whippin' somethin' clean like a bald head
Bitch with me drop dead gorgeous, plus she well read
I'ma get brain on the plane if it's overnight
I'ma maintain in the game, I ain't overnight
Colder than some polar ice, or like the ghost on poltergeist
Opinions suck, I know I'm nice, money talks, you overpriced
I'm doper, fuck a sober life, you local, you ain't smokin' right
My weed loud as Hulk Hogan fights when he rip the shirt
On the throne, you kickin' dirt, sip this purp, and spit berzerk
You a bitch, your chick a flirt, stop your crying, get to work
I talk shit, got the stats that'll back it up
My shit adding up, racking up a plaque a month
And that loud ass bass you hearin', that's the trunk
That vibration on your body, now that's a bump
You can tell us who you are, you don't have to front
You ain't a captain, you just Captain Crunch
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came in real, and you came through frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' 
All that money don't make you nothin'
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came through real, and you came in frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' 
And all that money don't make you nothin'
I rock A-P-C's, some B-A-P-E's
So many different clothing brands, I got A.D.D
Bought a big ole' crib, you can picture me in it
Just decided that the sky isn't really my limit
Somethin' cold in my cup, some weed, rollin' a blunt
Smile long, like I convinced Oprah to fuck
I think I lost my mind, need a Amber Alert
You can't talk that shit unless you stand in it first
Turn a bitch to fan, even hand her some merch
To be a legend, you gotta start out with that amateur work
And I paid my dues, walked humbly on an ego trip
Sleepin' with a freaky bitch, you was chillin', chiefin' fifth
Doin' drugs with a porno chick, watchin' porno flicks
Make her own movie and I'm scorin' it
I'll see you in hell before I see you winnin'
Did it myself, and I beat the system
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came in real, and you came through frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' 
All that money don't make you nothin'
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came through real, and you came in frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' 
And all that money don't make you nothin'
I got thirty thousand grams in a black on black van
Tell Chapo im his number one fan
I'm at Bent Taco with a hunnit' A-bands
And you ain't gettin' no work listenin' to this money change hands
I'm tryna sow the whole block up that's my plan
We can have a gun fight like i walked and i ran
Half a mill on el tran
Sellin'  to make bands
Im movin kushy, you's a pussy pussy, come between friends
If my Vo try to book me, I'ma get the front end
Style sixty niggas wit' me with a 100 elf hands
Ice cubes on my wrist
Bitch, I got a Mac-10
I put her out
She got her mom like i let her back in
Its Gucci!
Came through stuntin', you came in buggin' now
I came in real, and you came through frontin'
You can hate me all you want, but you ain't doing nothin' 
All that money don't make you nothin'

Well, it's a, crazy motherfucker named Mac
Shit, I'm in it too deep, ain't no time for goin' back
And the flow is jacked, Colt .45 in the grocery bag
You know it's that explosion rap, fire cracker, broken glass
These motherfuckers ain't bubblin', the soda flat
Forever I'ma go to bat, bitches wanna hold him back
Impulsive, irrational, he a maniac, but fuck gossip
Keep it casual, where the paper at?
A couple problems, fuck options, too late for that
I need the check, someone tell me where the waiter at
Oh, it's the devil, tell me where the angels at
And tell 'em I want my—, I want my—, want my baby back
Insane shit, my brain probably ain't attached
Don't show your face round here, it isn't safe for that
Bitch, I got my heart broke, on lock though
Keep a couple keys out in Longboat
Drugs
Yeah, don't, do
Drugs
Yeah, don't do
Drugs
Yeah, don't do
Drugs
Yeah
Okay, well
Well, the assets deeper than the rap check
They sleepin' on the ether still, I ain't take a nap yet
They all up in my shit like a airport bag check
Well, that shit is tactics, you haven't seen me mad yet
Dalai Lama, motherfucker, chill out
Weed was so cool, but everybody poppin' pills now
Yup, the Broke Till I'm Dead hoodie on
I make the songs that the bitches throw the pussy on
I'm a king on the board, y'all be lookin' pawn
Pissin' on a lawn with my dick in my palm
Isn't he on? Officially the ticker of bomb
At the crib chillin', thinkin' 'bout Nicki Minaj
It's a mirage, don't believe half the shit that we say
Me, I'm on the freeway, motherfuckin' PA
Droppin' like D-Day, shoppin' like eBay
Always gotta ball up, I'm Fuamatu-Ma'afala that
Drugs
Yeah, don't, do
Drugs
Yeah, don't do
Drugs
Yeah, don't do
Drugs
Yeah, okayEvery day a different car ride
A ticket on the plane
All of the sudden all these people dont be treating me the same
Treating hoes like a bombvoyya
See them tomorrow
The second that you wake up baby im be gone
I got all the time
I got so much to do
I'm not losing my mind out here fuckin' with you
Tryin' to travel overseas
Blowin' smoke in costa rica
Beat gettin' walked on
The sole is on my sneakers
Keep up we after the tippy no ballerina
Rockin show they say eureka, they start to do the macarena
Chiddy I see ya, we turn them to believers
Smoke and get high it all
I'm trying to do my thing
Figure out who the jokers around and who the kings
Maybe one day, fuck it never say never
For the bars it my pleasure this the best day ever motherfucker
We live a fast life
No one told us about the speed limit
We in the UK steady smoking weed in it
This my douquati flow
Kill tracks I body those
We player stay in vegas at the bellagio
Im gone, adios
See what you made me do
Just go and kill some shit crazy too
The flow is evil nigga chuckies bride
Pride never tucked aside
When I was just a superstar in my mothers eyes
What changed the brother skies
A slight forecast
If I kill these verses I can get some more cash
The expensive shit we someday could afford that
Im on the plane and they probably couldn't board that
I like the way you brought me down and it brought me up
Its early morning but I'm steaming nigga, coffee cup
Yeah just know I'm holding a prize
Before you know it I'm fired why won't you open your eyes?Yeah
Hello, happiness
Hello, honeymoon
Hello, passionate love, where the fuck was you?
I been waitin' all my life just for you
Am I in love with you, or am I just confused?
Baby, you was the one to come save me
Tell the world I wasn't crazy
But lately, your mind just isn't here no more
What did I do?
You not a bitch, just always angry
But it's so difficult to hate me
I'm the closest thing to home you'll ever know
Oh, baby, why you so mad at me?
Let you have all of my love and it's still not enough, shit
Why you so hard to please?
Gave you every single part of me
You're never satisfied
Satisfied
Never satisfied
Satisfied
Yeah
Hello for the night, it ain't complicated
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, ain't no obligation
Not a single string attached, this ain't a puppet show
You didn't want to fall in love, you made her come and go
Yeah, she was only here so I forget her
And be distracted by the pleasure
It's way too painful to remember
So I get faded and pretend it's all good
And when I'm underneath the weather
Tryin' to keep my shit together
I never surrender
Oh, baby, why you so mad at me?
Let you have all of my love and it's still not enough, shit
Why you so hard to please?
Gave you every single part of me
You're never satisfied
Satisfied
Never satisfied
Satisfied
YeahEasy Mac, rap slick and sensational
Foolin' fools out their shoes
Like the first of april
I'm aimin' low
With words guarentee to make them fold
I'll be remembered next december but your name will go
My name remains rhymes sent to ya brain
Attention sustain these other cats resent and complain
My minds bent and insane till the lyrics are complete
Spittin' fear in the ears to all those who compete
I never skip a beat, the kid is swisher sweet
You can picture me cheesin' then my album hits the street
With the words that sick to speak, so I spit it in my sleep
Countin' sheep, I'm about the heat
Provin' anyone wrong who was doubtin' me
They say "Malcolm please get a new career"
It appears that they fear who I'll be in a year
But I'm creatin' racket, makin' tracks up in the attic
See my life changed after I heard Illmatic
It was drastic, automatic rap and fantastic
I'm jurassic, mic melts like plastic
I got the gift and you wish that you had it
So you study hip hop and you read How-to-do's
Thinkin' that it's helpin' but you learnin' how to lose
See I was born gifted, lift or get lifted
If rappin' ain't my life then what is it
Ugh, rhymes is my dome's home on a gold throne
Spittin' sick burnin' holes in the ozone
I rock clothes that don't fit me
Flows that spit quickly
And rip cities, kickin' clowns that hit midi's
Cause I piss busy, I'm sorry you just missed me
I can't bare what you spit cause it's grizzly
I kick shit you can't spit nit wit sit quick
And let me twist back my Pit' fit
The best yet, blessed the cash wrecked
In fresh sweats with more words than last breaths
Your next guess with more swords for breast pests
Take your best guess, cause war is the next step
I got a passion for rappin'
I'm passin the has-beens who passive reactions
You askin' for action, I'm clashin' up your atoms
Your ass will get flattin' be askin' what happened
I'm sleep deprived, but managin' to keep my mind
And when rest try to find me I seek to hide
Bleed from eyes, they been open for too long
My body needs sleep but these demons is too strong
My insomnia lets me spit the monologues
Stayin' up writin' as the night is goin' on and on
Out my mind, I'm a maniac insane with rap
Raises, now the brain is scratched players playin' haters at
Traitors need to watch they back
Cause I know just where they at
Scared to rap, to where I'm at
Lookin' and I'm starin' back
Hatin's say your prayers and that
Pittsburgh that's where I'm at
We true hip hop, and we the rarest catsYeah
Y'all already know what it is, man
TreeJ, motherfuckin' Grow Op
Ladies and gentlemen, I go by the name Mac Miller
And I'ma start rappin' to y'all in a second, but
I gotta light this first
You know that's important, man
It's motherfuckin' 4/20, I’d like to wish y'all a happy holiday
I want y'all to put this in, turn it on
Have some pre-rolls ready
And don’t stop smokin' 'til this shit's done, man
The man Big Jerm on the beat
TreeJ, smokin' icon
I'ma tell you one time, man, I ain't gon' tell you again
All y'all fools who think you smoke
I put you up against my mans TreeJ
I bet you fifty thousand dollars he'll smoke you under the table
That's real, holla at me
Alright, so, let's see
Uh, uh, yeah
Still blowin' trees like a hurricane
And I knock a pussy out with my herbal stra— 
Still blowin' trees like a hurricane
And I knock a pussy out with my herbal stra—
Uh, uh, yeah
Still blowin' trees like a hurricane
And I knock a pussy out with my herbal strain, ha
Have 'em fast asleep
Look at 'em laughin' like, "Pass that weed"
Haven't made a weed song in a minute though
'Cause I've been gettin' dough, now it's back to gettin' smoke
Have a muhfucker high on her tippy toes
And zip a O, now you smokin' with a pro
So what you know about that?
You smoke weed, what you know about wax?
Haha, cookin' it up
At the airport, TSA lookin' at us
You used to smoke that dirt, you couldn't adjust
When you had to hit that kush
You was used to the bush like W. George
Come with this killer and I promise that you gonna end up sittin' in the morgue
Most Dope blow the most smoke, that's a fact, bitch
Plus-size section with my blunt, that's a fat bitch
Why you smokin' on that rap shit?
Why you even have it? Pillow tight weed on my mattress
You now rockin' with TreeJ, Clockwork the DJ
Smokin' another after that, replay
Most Dope, muhfucker, this The Grow Op
My weed stinkin' like Justin with no socks
Yeah, I'm a show off, probably has him mad as fuck
I’ll give him bars, and Bugs Bunny, and Duffy Duck
What you lookin' at, muhfucker? Pass the blunt!
"Lucky Ass Bitch" video, where is it? Cut, cut, cut, cut
Like a , these other crews smoke less than an 80 though
Find me smokin' blunts with Fran and Vinny Radio
That's The Come Up, smoke until the sun's up
Light another blunt 
Yeah, muhfucker, this The Grow OpHey
Big Jerm, cool beat that we made here, man
I played the keys, you play the drums, did a little bass on this one
Uh
Hey
 Alright, alright, alright, alright
'92 'til infinity and beyond
You witnessin' ya gambles of infinity
Music in my soul, on the go, ain't gettin' rid of me
Peace and divinity in each and every inch of me
We livin' through this melody, you singin' in a different key
See, I'm nice with these rhymes, I might be blind
Just see inside of minds, I gets unkind
I'm like a physic; I don't give a fuck if you like this
We here to party, had a little music to turn up loud
Uh, '92 'til infinity just some shit that you ain't heard in a while
I don't give a fuck if there ain't a party
We got a little music to turn up loud
We different, got our life that we livin', standin' out in the crowd
That boom bap rap
They ask me how I do it, I'ma tell 'em I'm just cool like that
Alright, alright, alright, alright, that boom bap rap
When they ask you what you doin'
Tell 'em that you cool and keepin' it movin'
Ain't nothin' new, I'ma do what I do
Yo
Pullin' up in somethin' that you haven't seen
Clean and accompanied by one of the baddest queens
Peel the top back, feelin' superb as I pass the green
We just cool and vibin' without the magazine
Breezin' through 376 thinkin' 'bout my past ventures
Came from runnin', duckin' and jumpin' over fences
Used to play reckless tryna get the check 
Now it's visions with my camp from the triple deck yacht
I can't stop, won't stop, I keep runnin'
Unleash the beast,  and keep comin'
Nasty but we spit it so sincerely
Drip phlegm from the pen so they can feel me
Boom bap ones with the hip-hop
They say we different, wonder how we do it, but it's sealed in a ziplock
Killin' beats from '87 'til the end of me
And Mac been involved since '92 until infinity
That boom bap rap
They ask me how I do it, I tell 'em I'm just cool like that
Alright, alright, alright, alright, that boom bap rap
When they ask you what you doin'
Tell 'em that you cool and keepin' it movin'
Ain't nothin' new, I'ma do what I do
This that boom bap shit, return of mister boom bapstic
Most Dope makin' new classics
Screem beef dog, look, lose that shit
You ain't built for contact, better do glasses
Haters get mad, my view zoom past 'em
You lose that, bitch, you think local, I do atlas
Vinny Radio do that shit
It's like bird flu how I move that sick-ness
Got my money lookin' healthy, work to stretch it every day, we call it physical fit-ness
Made my name in the game from playin' no games but givin' these beats the busi-ness
It's a guaranteed conviction every time I kill a track, I'm lettin' you all wit-ness
We deserve a reward for bringin' back that boom bap rap that you miss-in'
That boom bap rap
They ask me how I do it, I tell 'em I'm just cool like that
Alright, alright, alright, alright, that boom bap rap
When they ask you what you doin'

These motherfuckers don't know, yeah
The tracklist filled up with so many mistakes, can't believe I'm alive
Will you be a saint or a sinner? Whatever you want, you decide
All day I been faded, all day I been faded, but fuck it, I drive
Now I'm in a Mercedes, the pills made me crazy, today I could die
Fall asleep in the pussy, wake up to the money, my life a cliché
I think I deserve a promotion, I think I'ma need me a raise
Tell these motherfuckers, "Keep playin'"
'Cause me, I created the game though
Stack my money and lay low, they can't fuck with my bankroll
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
I been a real one, yeah, I been a real one
Yeah , yeah
I get up with the sun, only sleep for a minute
Then back to the grind 
They party and bullshit, get wasted, I done it
Ain't wastin' my time 
I'm faded, my eyes low, so no reason to hide that I'm blatantly high
Bitches been trippin' since in the beginnin'
Don't listen every time they tellin' me lies, oh no 
All I ever wanted was to be somebody special
Couple diamonds dancin' on the dental
Cap in mind, don't mind though by the elbow, yeah, you know
Know you poppin' when you make a million dollars on the cellphone 
Money been a manifesto, said, the money been a manifesto, yeah
I'm up like espresso, the bitches say, "Hello"
I'm outta the friendzone 
I rode with the homies, where ever we go
We don't follow no dress code 
And I'm still young, gettin' faded to feel numb
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah 
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
I been a real one, yeah, I been a real one, yeah
Yeah, you know that I am a real one 
Yeah, count my money to a million 
Count my money to a billion 
My new crib look like a building 
Nowadays don't got no feelings 
Fucked that bitch right in my whip, yeah
But my new whip got no ceiling 
Hit that bitch straight from the back, yeah
Aim at her face when I finish 
That lil' nigga pray I lose, yeah
Know that he mad that I made it, yeah, wait up

I was patient, money right now
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah
Tell everyone that you know, all my life I been a real one, yeah

I know you gon' love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights 
In the neon lights 
In the neon lights

I usually write rhymes in the BlackBerry
But I went back to the pen for this one 
So I'ma let my fingers do the talkin'
And she probably what they talkin' bout 
Girl, you got to listen 
I'm in this situation where you got me sittin' waitin'
And I'm losin' all my patience, I just need a vacation 
Your friends all player-hatin' 
'Cause I'm the one you always stay awake with 
Then spend the day with, always wanna walk ya home
And you hate the way my day-to-day is on the road 
Front row, know every single song
When she know she comin' home with me, she always bring her thong 
And bring her lingerie whatever mood she in
Put a movie in, got the lights dim
We gon' make love 'til the nights end 
Have you callin' up ya friends like, "Ooh, I like him" 
Baby, if I don't have money 
Then I don't have a heartbeat 
I know you gon' love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights 
In the neon lights 
In the neon lights 
I know you gon' love my name
I know I take ya breath away, darling
Smooth playa, treat you like a princess 
'Cause love tricky like parallel parking 
A business I won't invest
But I show interest in that slim waist of yours
And I smile when I see that pretty face of yours 
Givin' you flavors that you ain't never taste before 
We gon' make love 'til you achin' sore 
And baby, don't worry, I'ma be rich
Name in the neon lights, haha 
So how about you give me that kiss?
'Cause you don't wanna sleep tonight 
Your one night love, gon' get swept off ya feet
Yes, get undressed from your breast to ya feet 
Light a cigarette just to stay awake
Liquor got us bangin' like a 808
Baby, if I don't have money 
Then I don't have a heartbeat 
I know you gon' love my name
When you see it on the marquee
In the neon lights 
In the neon lights 
In the neon lights 
I know you gon' love my name
Throw your hands up, people, party all night
Celebrate my name in the neon lights
Throw your hands up, people, party all night

In the neon lights 
In the neon lights 
I know you gon' love my nameI'm so gone
Ayo, I get so gone
I said, I'm so gone
Uh, uh
Ayo, I'm so gone, somewhere in a cloud
The room is filled with smoke but the blunt still goin' 'round
We blowin' pounds, I'll admit I'm just a weed head
My mom say by age 40 I'ma be dead
But I live free in a world that's make-believe
To say the least, I be goin' like I'm off the leash
I'm pretty chief, roll another four-a-piece
Hit the crib, get it Jerm, have him sendin' me some heat
The beats I speak on, I'm spittin' like my teeth gone
Off an L a couple hundred feet long
Cop it by the pound, smoke until the weed gone
That's when you'll find me goin'
I'm so gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, feelin' like I can't go
On, on, on, on
On, on, on, boy, this weed so bomb
I been high for so long, long
I'm so gone
Ayo, I get so gone
I said, I'm so gone
Uh, uh
And this purple got me paralyzed, the reddest pair of eyes
That you ever seen, never wearin' Visine
I ain't tryna hide it 
See, I'ma superhero, Mary Jane just my sidekick 
Yeah, something I can't live without, girl, you got me lifted
Those who tell me not to smoke, it's really not your business 
They say I'm so young and so gifted
But fuck it, more blunts gettin' twisted 
I love it, I'm so drunk, so piffy
Find me at the spot with mo' skunk, no middies
Y'all know this blueberry so pretty
I'll only come if Mary Jane can go with me
Haha
I'm so gone 
Ayo, I get so gone
The Sour Hour
Sour Hour
I said, I'm so gone
TreeJay, what up, boy? 'Bout to get Chik-FilGot my mind in the cloud see paradise living with style
My mom should be proud I've been dedicated now for a while
I'm in love with hip-hop, I'm in love with life
I'm in love with the days, late nights, kush, money, I'm in love with this mic 
And I've got time on my side because I'm young and I'm grindin' so hard 
Because I'm saying something every single time and I'm rhyming my bars 
I'm just a child, y'all gon' see me grow
But now I know, I've got so far to go
Sometimes I think about this time next year
Grinding to the fullest kicking rhymes for your ears
I wonder if they hear me now, coming fresh with a style
The illest child always chilling with a smile
Cause hip-hop waitin' for me back at home, we just need to have a little time alone
Because lately I've been living life by my phone
Tryin' to do business, mind on my dough
Woah, hold up, let me take a rest
Bring your back with my dogs like I'm playing fetch
I'm trying to be the future, molding the CD
Something bumping out the system all repeat
My minds elevated like ET
Work hard in quick sand, knee deep
You know I'm always doing double like a re-read
It's like I played the whole game with a cheat sheet
Dollar signs to my name like Too Short
Gonna go broke with this tax no newport
I'm unhealthy, working to succeed
Trying to spit out more words than I can read
Staying up late, keep burning through this weed
My grandma probably turning in her
G-R-A-V-E, that's right
Spelling bee champ 5th grade
This my job, I'm about my guap
Keep it fresh like shoes right out the box
I'm just trying to give you something loud to knock
So far to go, but I'm never gon' stop
Got my mind in the cloud see paradise living with style
My mom should be proud i've been dedicated now for a while
I'm in love with hip-hop, I'm in love with life
I'm in love with the days, late nights, kush, money, I'm in love with this mic
I've got time on my side because I'm young and I'm grindin' so hard
Because I'm saying something every single time and I'm rhyming my bars
I'm just a child, you can see me grow
But now I know, I've got so far to goYeah, cocaine mountains until I overdose 
It's me and this money, sittin' alone, I know 
It's gettin' harder to get along with my dad
I been feelin' like he grew jealous of everything that I have, I swear 
They don't teach you 'bout reality 
With a super model on the penthouse balcony 
Me and my homies got a death wish 
So, God, can you direct me to the exit please? 
I been waitin' on a miracle, I give my life for that emblem
That say wealthy on my steerin' wheel
That pain is an illusion, but that fear is real
You either here to die or here to kill
Yeah, best believe in envy
Look outside my window and the evil gon' tempt me, uh
A model bitch with double D's and she pretty
'Bout to cause a riot, who the fuck comin' with me? 
I got the key to the city, I got the key to the city
I got the key to the city, it's time to open the door
I got the key to the city, I got the key to the city
They was swearin' they my homies, they don't know me no more
I got the key to the city, I got the key to the city
I got the key to the city, time to open the door
I got the key to the city, I got the key to the city
They was swearin' they my homies, they don't know me no more
Yeah, yeah
Pittsburgh  live and die in my Pittsburgh 
Everything became different when I gave my dad that Fisker 
Young home owner, out of control, I don't know sober 
Feel alone again, grab my phone and call hoes over 
The next day I just forget her 
Unless that pussy somethin' to remember 
I could live inside this chaos 'til forever 
But the sooner I reach clarity the better 
Live inside of this jungle, watch me crumble under the pressure 
Everyday is like, "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you," man, I'm fed up 
I pick my head up  and hold my feet down 
All my homies gon' eat now 
Yeah, best believe in envy
Look outside my window and the evil gon' tempt me, uh
A model bitch with double D's and she pretty
'Bout to cause a riot, who the fuck comin' with me? 
I got the key to the city, I got the key to the city
I got the key to the city, it's time to open the door
I got the key to the city, I got the key to the city
They was swearin' they my homies, they don't know me no more
I got the key to the city, I got the key to the city
I got the key to the city, time to open the door
I got the key to the city, I got the key to the city
They was swearin' they my homies, they don't know me no more
Search for the solution to confusion that keep comin' on
You just trapped inside delusion, young man, run along, run along
It's so real, oh, it's so real
It's scary, terrifyin', yeah

You just live the high life
AhaOh yeah
Yeah
This is everything you dreamed of, isn't it? 
Now that you here, why does it feel so different? 
I bet you feelin' so infinite 
And you don't gotta worry 'bout shit again  
Yeah, brand new crib, who let all these bitches in?
Fuck it, if they fine, then it's fine, we just kickin' it 
Get the weed, grab a glass, pour some liquor in
Everybody got the devil in 'em just a little bit
Oh, used to be so innocent
Used to study everyday, get nothin' but some A's
'Til the money never came
Oh, what a shame, isn't it? 
This shit feel just like some good pussy
Those days that you skipped school playin' hooky
This shit feel like some head in the middle of the day
Get you wet, got you singin' in the rain
I'm just sayin', let me stunt a bit, stunt a bit 
I'm just havin' fun with it, I'm drunk as shit
My bitch stayin' sober, so I'm lettin' her drive
While I'm in the passenger seat
Like, "How the fuck this shit happen to me?"
I wished I cared, I don't give a shit, aware I'm a citizen
Are you there, are you listenin'?
It ain't a light if it's flickerin'
You see, I just wanna shine, see Mr. Fisherman
Yeah
This is everything you dreamed of, isn't it? 
Now that you here, why does it feel so different? 
I bet you feelin' so infinite 
And you don't gotta worry 'bout shit again 
Yeah, brand new crib, who let all these bitches in?
Fuck it, if they fine, then it's fine, we just kickin' it 
Get the weed, grab a glass, pour some liquor in
Everybody got the devil in 'em just a little bit
Yeah
I told myself, once I hold my own checks
That I would go and buy myself a gold Rolex
I was sayin', "Oh yes," but I don't know yet
They told me, "Take it slow, homie, don't flex" 
And all you lil' bitches, you don't pose no threat
See, I've been around for years, I'm a Most Dope vet
I be stone cold stuntin'
Gotta know, don't guess 
I don't hear none of y'all, I'm so, so deaf 
Homie, you just gotta let it go, don't stress 
I just wanna smoke a little weed and have sex 
When I hit it from behind, see, I make that ass stretch
Only fuck with tens, yo' bitch got bad breath
All I do is get high and cash checks
Call a bitch over, MapQuest the address
Access the mattress, that pussy mad wet
Gimmie head, crack necks
Heard she a ho, we gon' know when we fact check
She like to call me daddy, probably 'cause her dad left
The science don't know what I am, they runnin' lab tests
Got a long way to go, a lot of gas left
Rather have more than have less
I'm in the booth rappin', I'm gettin' mad head
Wanna put it in her pussy and she tell me that's next
I don't fear nothin', I don't even fear death
Keep goin' 'til, 'til my last breath
This is everything you dreamed of, isn't it? 
Now that you here, why does it feel so different? 
I bet you feelin' so infinite 
And you don't gotta worry 'bout shit again 
Yeah, brand new crib, who let all these bitches in?
Fuck it, if they fine, then it's fine, we just kickin' it 
Get the weed, grab a glass, pour some liquor in
Everybody got the devil in 'em just a little bit
Yeah
I do it hippo large, spit those bars
'Bout a quarter million, I whip those cars
Bein' rich so hard, sniff those bars
And it seem like every time I make a hit go yard
My bitch in love with my dick so far
She love to swallow, said, "This shit low carb"
You better sit right down, this shit gon' start
Because this my town, it's Pittsburgh park
All the drugs I did so far
I'm just hopin' that my dick get hard It's Young Veggies right here
You know what I'm sayin'? We in the studio , Chi Town
I got my niggas with me 
I got my people with me 
Mac Meezy , Mikey watchin' this shit too )
You know I'm sayin'? 
Your swag's shit 
It go rock-a-bye baby
What if I'm fuckin' with my butterfly lady
In the backseat of the 'Cedes, or the Saleen
Somethin' that I cop, made in the eighties
I've been lost inside this puzzle
Rearrangin', keep on sayin' I'm a goddamn fool
Tell me, "Quit playin'," I'm like, "No can do"
Been through this bullshit
Actin' foolish as a dude that's hit with Cupid's doings
Music is the key to everything I keep pursuin'
Bitches used to do the friend thing, now they ask me what I'm doin'
Tryna give me head before the show
Go while I'm interviewin' with a student newspaper
Maybe with the radio
Curb Your Enthusiasm, ho, the Larry David Show
Was somethin' that we probably watchin' while we be gettin' high
Step aside if anybody think they lookin' fresh as I am
With my Daily Bread hoodie and a floral hat
This shit these rappers talkin 'bout
I'm gettin' bored of that
This, or that, and a wiffle ball bat
Make a million dollars, then I give it all back
These rappers talkin' shit when they shit is all wack 
Yeah, I said it on wax
Yeah, I'm pullin' stars from the sky
Live large, get high
Women lie, men lie, but we always fly
At the end of the movie, dubs always cry 
Pullin' stars from the sky 
Live large, get high
It's all live, baby 
Golded up like Tut, It make guys hate me 
But I ain't givin' a fuck, I tell 'em, "Drive safely"
How dare a man lift his hand at me like I'm gon' flinch?
I'm not no bitch 
With the concreature concrete monuments 
 prolly pack his bag if he tryna trip
Nick Bruno, Boldy James kinda shit
It's like The Godfather, y'all gotta honor this 
Tryna split the money up like communists 
You should shake the person hand that put you on to this
Hold up, that's the swag you would kill for 
What the fuck you tryna chill for? 
Are you alive or a stillborn?
'Cause you really ain't livin' 'til you get yours
Sky's the limit, we could build doors
Open 'em up, nothin' gon' be closed, I'm sure
This, or that, and a wiffle ball bat
Make a million dollars, and then give it all back
These rappers talkin' shit when they shit be all wack
Yeah, I said it on wax
We pullin' stars out the sky
Live large, get high
Men lie, women lie, but we always fly
At the end of the movie, dubs always cry
Pullin' stars out the sky
Live large, get high, haYo, Soul Theory!
Let's get it man, ha
DJ Capcom is the beast of this game
Y'all better get him a leash
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll anotha
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll anotha
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll anotha
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll anotha
Haha, yo
You see they probably wonder why I don't smile
Cause these cats need to get their own style
Hold the phone dial
I go miles, when I'm sprinting on the beat
You'll get lifted of your feet
When you spliffin' up my trees
Quit givin' me a speech
I ain't really tryna hear this
See with these lyrics
I'm tryna run fearless
We playing games in this jungle, Jumanji
With bomb tree, hidden under all my dirty laundry
Call me an arm free fucking around
I'm putting words in your mind
So you in love with the sound
They saving my place
Tryna shove this food in my face
So they force it down my throat
Till I'm use to the taste
Now move to your place
Cuz I'm campin' out on top
Fresh kicks on my feet
While you sittin' in some socks
Cops tryna get me locked
Catch me fucking with shenanigans
But I'll just handle them and throw them in the ambulance
They want to know what my hands is in
Scare me straight
Get back bitch I ain't tryna share my plate
What's good fam, I love money, I will marry cake
Get a rich bitch like Ashley and Mary Kate
And I ain't talking about one of them
I'm getting both
I grab them and get a loaf
And then take their money and their coats
I blow trees, so my mouth is always filled with smoke
You sniffin' coke
Singing but you haven't hit a note
Plus that shit you wrote isn't set to carry a crowd
I'm legendary anywhere that I'm out
I'm sharing this pound
With my people like a how high sequel
Told my people need to air out the house
So beware of my mouth
Spittin' venom, coming out the cerebellum
With these kicks on my feet
See I told you I was gellin'
You playin' felon
You in stealin' a penny
I put a hole in your belly like you Oprah or Jenny
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll anotha
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll anotha
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll anotha
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll anotha
I sport a long white tee, fitted cap, baggy pants
If you see me be sure to slap my hand
Some people do it for the love
Some people do it cuz they can
But me, I'm tryna be legend like Bag a Vance
Some rap will make you think
While other shit will make you dance
So I bump what ever is in the system
Tryin' to make some plans
I just want to see what's good for the night time
IF nothings hype, I'ma head up to crib and write rhymes
Age like white wine, nicer by the second
That's why I never put punctuation on a sentence
Cuz the song goes on, here a dope song
If they say I wasn't for real, then you was told wrong
See you ain't on, what we on
You bright, I'm neon
I'm smoking up the weed till the tree gone
Yeah
My life is up and down like a see-saw
So I stay with a bitch like my name was Leon, Phelps
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another
Lick it, split it, twist it, hit it, spliff it, pitch it, roll another

We’re doing it
We’re doing it
That is it I don’t care, we are doing it
I don’t—
Mac:
Ok
Alright you remember the one I was telling you about on a spiritual journey
The one song that came to me and told me
“Hey man you could do this. You can be a human being if you just try.”
Remember that one?
Tay:
Yes
Mac:
Lets do that one
Tay:
Lets do it
Say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say
I said
I never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna to make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney boy, my family
Make 'em say "ow", make 'em say "oh"
The hoes that tell me "yes", the same ones that tell you "no"
Woah, I ain't just an Average Joe
Let me hear y'all sing this shit with me!
You ready?
Let's go!
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
Sing!
Sing!
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day ever
Woo!
Say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say
And if it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half insane and with the lames I see you hatin'
Nothing' that you're changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin'
I'll be in another zone, move out my mother's home to a world I call my own, said
I ain't gonna play around no more
Found a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Let me hear y'all sing this shit!
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be--- happy, only laughing like a child
I can't hear you!
I never thought life would be this sweet
I can't hear you!
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day everThis next song right here is called the Star Room
Its how i open up my album, man
Yeah eah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
This song is the moment you stop lying to yourself, alright?
Hallelujah, thank God I have a future
Prayin’ I don’t waste it gettin’ faded
Cause I’m smokin backwoods till I’m coughin’ up tar
Through the surge, energy curve like a lumbar
I don’t act hard, I still read Babar
Trippin’ out, lookin’ at a bunch of Google map stars
They got a app for that
But me, I’m still trapped inside my head, it kinda feel like it’s a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I’m living paradise, so would I have to worry ’bout?
Dealing with these demons, feel the pressure, find the perfect style
Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
And I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form
The difference between love and war inform me – I’m above the norm
But, give me anybody though
I’ll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts
Rhyming like it’s summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven’t picked a major label, think I’m blackballed
I still don’t got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice
And I don’t know what I’m running from, but I’m running still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it’s nothing real
I’m from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn’t make me sign a fucking deal
Money kills, that’s the truth, it’s called the root of evil
But I want that Rolls Royce that the homie Lennon drove
So, if you don't got some money for me I’mma send you home
Unconventional, special but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that’s letting me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity, I let them go
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow
That’s just me all wilding out and being extra, though
I wonder if I lost my way
I wonder if i lost my wa-ay
Did I lose my wa-a-a--a-ay?
My wa-ay
Did I lose my way?
My way, yeah
Aye, uh come on, come on, come on, come on
S-San Diego, come on, come on
So can you feel it?
Said, can you feel it?
Said, can you feel it?!
Let's Go!
Woo!
San Diego, California. We gon' start this one like this:
Said, I’m posing a question
How many been empty and holding aggression?
Close to depression, open your eyes and just focus a second
Fuck a reccession my brother
My mind is my weapon I’m letting it go
Know that I’m pointing at negative energy, telling me stop
They’re telling me no
Your aura is something you ain’t even sure of
Explore the core of California, hoes got more to snort up
I’ve had a smorgasbord pornographic thought
That’s a lot, the feeling come after the shock
Praise me I’d rather you not, cause
It’s driving me crazy
The fact that you pay to make me into something I love
You come to the club searching for drugs, drunk
Fucking these sluts
God loves me, what if he does, what does it mean?
You’re wasting away doing nothing, you’re fronting
Why ain’t you chasing your dreams?
We wonder ’bout life but none of us willing to learn
The money we earn is something to burn
Why won’t they give me a turn–out?
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You’re mistaken the world is cold and it’s lonely ain’t it
When ‘em high roller homes in Vegas
Raid them with some home invasions
Contaminating the place with plague, we just saved the day
I waste away in a room spitting these raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands and I’m giving it back, Tay
It's a gift
Our, our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
Our, our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
Okay, forfeit in the war, he lays a sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate
Dealing with death like you work in the morgue observing the souls
Forgotten, he lost his way
Starring down that barrel, thinking not today
Life’s so precious, said Lord knows life is so precious
Fight to the death, til’ there’s nobody left
You’re holding your breath because you might get infected
Minimalistic, instinctively thinking of getting ballistic
Be specific, to those in control we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I’m intertwined
My trigger finger itching, all I kill is time 
Initial symptoms is schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can’t agree on who’s its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I’m shooting lasers
Except I’m cool with Vader
And blowing up rooms that’s full of strangers
A news anchor, the youth can relate to, it’s nature
If you a hater, I’ll deal with you later, no thank you
I’m just your neighbor, please don’t do me no favors
Said, really doe, come on homie we major
I waste away in this room spitting out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands and I’m giving it back, Tay
It's a gift
Our, our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
Our, our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
One, two, one two, three everybody put your hands up!
Get em up, so put your hands up!
Get em up, so get em up!True love is hard to find, so I thought I'd start this rhyme
With a couple bars and lines of leavin' it all behind
I've had all the dimes and all are fine
But now I need the one to call her mine
You know that girl that everybody wants?
But can't have fat ass, nice eyes, high class
I get the last laugh now 'cause she under my arm

I tell her, "Listen, I ain't gon' do you wrong
Forget what you hear in all my songs
My old ways is gone, I'ma be real wit'cha
Recently I been lookin' at the big picture

You used to the bullshit, the dudes put you through it
Cupid, never shot up nuisance
See with me my love is with the music
But, baby, you can be the next to it 
My boys say I'm stupid, I need to move along
And when we fight I hope you use this song to get it right
My moms is gettin' jealous how I feel about her
And the fellas say I could deal without her
See, baby, I ain't playin' around
I don't need cupid dude could have aimed at the ground

She got a little bit of beauty, little bit of class
Little bit of lips and a little bit of ass
Little bit of style, dressed to kill
Little bit of freak with a sex appeal
I'm so down for whatever, baby
Always dressed fresh and wavy
Wanna make love, ah yeah, that's gravy
Late night sex get extra crazy 
Ain't gonna leave, I'm stayin'
Sick of all the games you playin'
Eye gazin', sex amazin', got you squintin', eyes look Asian
I know I'm just a kid, baby, tell me what this is
'Cause I seen you shake, I seen you moan every time I touch your lips 
You grab my hand, run your fingers through my hair
Everywhere we go the scent of sex all through the air
Yeah, I know you think I'm playin', right? 
How 'bout you take just take a chance, stay the night?

I'm amazed, actin' like there ain't no time to waste 
She a freak, lemme get her right behind the stage 
My true shorty though 
I've had all sorts of hoes 
Take my time when I'm with her, drink my 40 slow
Any given second, you can find us on the bed 
Wild sex, with her legs behind her head
Turn her over on her stomach, get it from the back 
She always leave a scratch, but I like that
She the type that  you wanna wife that 
And she like me 'cause all I do is pipe that 
Buzzin' like a bumblebee that's chillin' by the hive
Love her with no limits, 'cause my ceilin' is the sky
Feelin' up ya thighs, tongue ticklin' ya twine
When I get it from behind, you say it's twistin' up your spine 
Baby, I'm  one of a kind that finds that spot that have you climax
I'm that boy
It's all right, It's okay, seein' you all night and all day 
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin', crushin' round the clock

Yeah, they told me, "Don't make a promise you can't keep"
All the drugs in your system, you can't sleep
How many times you had to buy a Plan B
For a girl you never bring back home to meet your family, man
Man, I swear it's what I dream about
Ever since my mom told me that she need me out
Always smoking weed, 'causing trouble, never clean the house
But I paid her back for everything, I guess we even now
Nothing better than some head after a long day
That's the only thing that ever keep mine on straight
And she asked me, "Why the long face?"
How I spent 350 dollars on this entré
I drown my sorrow in that bottle
Today is full of regret, fine forever in tomorrow
Man up, what's the problem?
Everything is Jazz and I'm Stockton 
Yeah, I know it seem a little bit strange sometimes 
Everybody live a little, everybody die 
That's life , whatchu gonna do? 
That's life , baby, I would spend it all witchu 
And I'm headed to the other side, where the grass is always greener
And your bitch is down to ride, but that ass is always meaner
See, my cash got deeper and my morals disappeared
Never thought I'd be a asshole, this my last show
Can I please get a standing ovation?
A hundred naked bitches in my dressing room waiting
We lost a lot of blood for this fucked up nation
But me, I'm getting high, making love in that spaceship
So what are the basics? Tell me your problems
You losin' your job or, even worse, you don't got one
So hard to stay sober when you feeling fucked over so much
Always coming up short, you like the roach of a blunt 
And I could never sleep at night
Fuck paying bills, I need a brand new lease on life
Why does doing wrong always feel so right?
Well, I guess, fuck it, that's life 
Yeah, I know it seem a little bit strange sometimes 
Everybody live a little, everybody die 
That's life , whatchu gonna do? 
That's life , baby, I would spend it all witchu 
Say you running out of time
That's life, babe, that's life, babe 
Wrong things on your mind
That's life, babe, that's life, babe 
Said your heart been broken
That's life, babe, that's life, babe
Just pick it up and keep going
It's alright, babe, it's alright, babeLive from the battlefield
 
Comes Superweirdo
 
Okay
My name Mac Miller, who the fuck are you? 
Paranoid motherfucker, I don't even trust the truth 
This ain't the motherfuckin' Huxstables
So if my mother doin' nothin', I'ma cut her loose 
I waste no time, criminal since '09
Posted on the coast line, smokin' on that 
Everybody say I do it so 
Young anomaly, destroyin' your Metropolis
Stand aside, I turn Rodeo Drive into the Gaza Strip 
It's the raw shit, drunk off confidence
I don't got a dealer, got an anesthesiologist 
Bitch, my shit is Artemis Fowl 
I'm standin' on the edge, they try calmin' me down
They talk fast, but they listen slow 
There ain't a better coach around than Dick LeBeau 
Uh, yeah, yeah
Oh myUhhhh
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yeah
Oh shit, here come the best part
Weapons from the Death Star
Puttin' metals through your Kevlar
Methods unorthodox
Due to the endorphins lost
I'm morphin' to some sort of corpse
Don't snort the devil's nectar
It's hard drugs and memoirs
Don't fuck with shit except ours
The rest is lightweight
For Christ's sake, I'm knockin' heads off
Depressed off the meds I acquired for my depressed pops
Cause, I like the rush more
I'm Herman Blume— don't get crossed
Amongst the privileged pissin' on groups of little kids
Litterin' mobbin' ignorant flickin' off all the fed cars
It's young Reptar, duelin' with the Templar
Where the wicked and the sins are
Gettin' head with the Benz parked
My repertoire of records broken, every single check large
Once you gettin' M's you start to question who your friends are
Yeah, from out the dark the million men march
Ready, set, start 
Yeah, yeah
Okay, said
The music secular, I'm givin' bitches dental work
Let the homies get a turn, man them hoes just never learn
Some meth to burn and the connect is bout to get some sherm
Tryna get so faded I forget that I was ever born 
You new rappers is all the lil homies
I need a bitch that sip 40's and keep the pistol for me
I'm finna O.D. I know it, I need to slow down my dosage
The money hittin' my phone but I don't answer I'm loaded
See I give a bitch the stale face
Good dick and a band-aid
That ass got an address, I come early like a tailgate
Painkillers before the liquor at snail's pace
I treat the world like it's jail bait 
Yeah
And I am not your enemy
But I bring the devil that's temptin' me
I do not fear your ignorance, the open mind is infinite
I escape this prison, fit in better where the sinners live
I'm dealin' with urges emergin' from dark places
I try to hide 'em though
Lies I hide behind keep remindin' me I'mma die alone
Higher than I can handle, my mind is scrambled
I'm tweakin', what do I believe in?
All my dreams turn into demons and they thirsty
It's seven thirty, try my best to hurry
Victims don't get the mercy, nuttier than Eddie Murphy
Tarty to the party, now it's common knowledge
I'm a fuckin' problem
Yeah
I chew this shit, God bless me
You will respect me
Is all good I got the Based God to protect me
Been smokin' less weed, meet my new friend Speed
I'mma fuck the world up till they forget meYeah, yeah, yeah
And the world, proceeds, to turn
Yeah

What's gravy, baby? I'll take it
Now bend it over, don't break it
Better fuck the homies I came with

A little bit of energy, wanna be with a celebrity
Now you nothin' but a memory
Do you love her? if you don't, get another, 'cause...
I know I've been takin' way too long

The world real happy for you, girl
The world real happy for you, girlThis next song one of my favorite to perform its called The Question, alright
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Sometimes I wonder
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
So I've been lookin' in the mirror and it still don't make no sense
I'm askin' what am I supposed to do?
I've done so much in my short lifetime, but I haven't done shit
I done flew around the whole world
First I shook a million hands and I took a million pictures
But I'm a hostage in my own world
And my thoughts my own enemy, got no time for these bitches
I got too much on my damn mind
So if I add some more stress, I just don't see how I'm a cope
I think they underestimate the grind
I do, bring this dough, and I'm only 20 years old
I wonder why I sip this devil juice
Cause it feel incredible, problems, I got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected
What am I doing here?
I wanna know I wanna know
What am I doing here
Said, What am I doing here
Said, What am I doing here
I hope this feelin' lasts for fuckin' ever
I don't want to come back down, let me stay above the ground
I hope I do what I was meant to do
Cause I've been searchin' for that answer, I just hope I get it now
Please, let me find euphoria
When you up above the clouds, like, who goin' to touch me now
And do we ever get to know the truth?
Cause everybody say they have it, but to me it seems they lack it
Now I'm rollin' and I'm sippin' lean
Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love
Drinkin' liquor and I'm smokin' weed
And you can never do too much if you don't ever do enough
Wonder why it's me instead of you
I'll be there to rescue you, problems you got several
Thank God that none of that medical
What I need yall to do put two hands in the air
We gon' go slow side to side
Said, what am I doing here?
What am I doing here
Woah, what am I doing here
Said, what am I doing here
Now one time look before we do this song right here
Before we do this song
Alirght, you gotta say: God damn!
God Damn! Yeah
Ahem
Yeah
I probably should've put this dream on layaway
I woke up in a frenzy, today's the day
I threw the function, bitches drunk off the Tanqueray
Now she got me in handcuffs, slap me and tell me to say her name
That bitch got a crazy brain, but everything a-okay
She a really good time, besides, that pussy is ace of spades
I wake up with a hangover, she already makin' eggs
I call her on my layover, she send pictures, spreadin' legs
Goddammit, this life of minе
Should've been a superhero somеwhere out fightin' crime
Instead I was lightin' my weed
Gettin' Eiffel high, the tower that is
My girlfriend appreciate the gifts I shower her in
You see, 2010 was the year that I made it
But lookin' back on it now, that shit be feelin' so ancient
I get to crackin' a smile, I got 'em fiendin' put the crack in the vial
Stir a ruckus like the cat that's chasin' after the mouse
We be breakin' all the glass in the house
Friday was crazy, but it's Saturday now 
I keep the glass half-full, the whisky bottle empty
Give praises to the most high, 'cause somebody up there bless me
It's nice bein' a millionaire but sometimes it's depressin'
We keep eatin' so much seafood, I'm just in the mood for Wendy's
I'm so regular, see?
It's crystal-clear insanity, that's ADHD
And I grew up with delinquents, we would play in the street
'Til it was late, causin' trouble while the neighborhood sleep
Runnin' away from police
What do we get older for? I wish I was only four
I wish I was sober more, but no, I be overboard
I'm sinkin' with my ship until it sit on the ocean floor
It's four in the mornin', I'm up and horny, downloadin' porn
I see the lies with eagle eye vision
We inside a dream of mine, we'll redefine livin'
All I need a television and some weed, I'm fine, chillin'
I'm hotter than a oven makin' pizza in your kitchen
Better keep your eyes peeled and open
Hit a blunt in the whip, tryna stunt with a bitch in the front
And a fifth I'ma sip 'til I'm sick and I'm drunk
I ain't givin' a fuck, yeah, I've been in a funk
Now I live like a pimp, into business stuff
A magician to tricks, make a bitch disappear like her boyfriend comin' to the game
Pay up like the first of the month, I'ma take what I want
Everybody need somethin', shit
If this my last day on this Earth, tell the kids to write my name in the dirt 
Cup full of liquor, mind full of bad ideas
The club closed, why the fuck are we the last ones here?
How I'm gettin' home? Who is callin' the place?
God don't recognize me, he must have forgotten my face
Find my way in this strange world
Strange, strange world we live in
And I'ma leave this bitch liftedYeah, yeah, yeah
Mama, don't cry no more, I'm comin' home
I'm not like you, could I be?
A lot of things that I do, I would not suggest that anybody do too
I'll carry your weight, so I don't gotta carry my own
Can you give me your problems please?
I'll take 'em with me and leave mine at home
Have you met somebody crazy as me? I'll wait, you'll see
Swear to God the studio should pay me to leave
Goddamn, I tried, I tried
Told the truth and I lied
Lord knows that I've been foolish
You mistakin' me for human one too many times, yeah
You gettin' no more emotion from me
Gimmie anybody who still believes that their dreams can come true
I guess I'll take your ignorant too, and I'll teach, and we'll see
And the rest you can keep, I don't need it
I'm not like you, could I be?
A lot of things that I do, I would not suggest that anybody do too
I'll carry your weight, so I don't gotta carry my own
Said, can you give me your problems please?
So I can leave mine at home
I'll be the first one to admit, sex been kind to me
Would I give it all back for just a crack at a goodnight sleep?
You set the table for me, sorry, I can't eat
It's easy to lie, you think I got places to be
Shit, I spend so much time tryin' to relax my mind
You spend every day on your feet, why can't you see that...
I'm not like you, could I be?
A lot of things that I do, I would not suggest that anybody do too
I'll carry your weight, so I don't gotta carry my own
Can you give me your problems please?
I'll take 'em with me and leave mine at home
Yeah

We in a race car, she let me hit it like a space bar
Girl, your life is in your phone, needa take charge
Hopin' that the dealer gonna hit you with a face card
But don't panic, we the planets and we make stars
Day job wasn't workin' out, I been laid off, takin' loss
Everything is A1 steak sauce, drivin' with the breaks off
I'ma-I'ma-I'ma ride though, way beyond the boundary
Where the line go, sippin' cyanide like it's fine wine
Shit is high tide, when it fall down that's when I rise
Feelin' that's inside, it'll blow your mind
I don't need to know what's yours just to know what's mine
Born in Babylon, droppin' like an atom bomb
Don't flinch, the flow so big it go to Macedon
Oh shit, don't fit inside, then stand out
Yeah, I was a kid, but I'm the motherfuckin' man now
And how it feelin'? Well, it's feelin' good
I got my life together like I knew I should
I let 'em read me like an open book
But turn the page on these motherfuckers

Are we there yet? Who gon' hold me down?
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet? Who gon' hold me down?
Okay, well
He is workin' on a thesis in a Prius, won him many masterpieces
Goddammit, they don't believe it, I'm Pittsburgh born and bred
Come inside, explore my head
Get you rattled, I can see you fragile, you an ornament
Just for show, all the negative, you needa let it go
So much work, it's stackin' up, I think I needa get a clone
Leave the nest, send me home, tell me when you ready
If I disappear awhile, promise that you won't forget me
I'm at the crib watchin' Ed, Edd, Eddy
My bitch naked in the kitchen and she whippin' up spaghetti
I got mo' problems, like Christopher
I'm walkin' with my headphones on, I been depressed so long
But now I'm back at it, like a bad habit to a crack addict
Light a match, 'bout to start shittin' on these motherfuckers
Don't know what it is and isn't with these motherfuckers
I got the juice, play some paper for these motherfuckers
Samurai sword, Kill Bill, Hattori Hanzō
Man in this world, will kill if I got to
It's no Biggie, who shot you?
It's my motherfuckin' city and I got a lock full
And how it feelin'? Well, it's feelin' good
I got my life together like I knew I should
I let 'em read me like an open book
But turn the page on these motherfuckers

Mac Miller, East End Empire
Sounds right, hahaWhat up cousin, how're you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
So, what up cousin?
How you been, homie?
What it is, homie?
Without you here, your family feel lonely
But it's all good cousin, we gone carry on
Although it seems so unfair you're gone
People nowadays never focus on the positives
Cause life now only good when the guap is big
They talkin' shit, hatin' for no reason
And haters is stupid
Baby my flow, leave 'em
So confused cause they all up 'bout this dumb shit
Lisa said she love it and the other shit is rubbish
So I'ma make my time here worth it, real good for you
Lookin' back like there's nothin' I couldn't do
And there's nothin' that I wouldn't do to bring you back
Poetry, heart and soul singin' rap
I've been thinkin' that I found my passion
Rappin' 'bout the future in an old-school fashion
What up cousin, how're you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
So, what up cousin?
They say my style ain't different
I'm just like e'ry body else
They say my pitches gotta change up
But all those people is just hatin' cause they don't know how to love they-self
Mad when someone bring my name up
And it's unfortunate cause I'm just here comin' from the heart, shit
I'm just tryna find somethin' for the market
And I ain't sayin' that I'm from the worst hardships
But my life ain't no walk in the park
It's been a shark pit, dark with no harvest
Drivin' in a car but can't find a place to park it
I got some people that I really need to ball with
That musta been what got this shit started
There's been some people that I hadn't said goodbye to
But my life gotta go on, and it don't mean that we forget
Because we dedicate our lives to, that's why I wrote this fuckin' song
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
So, what up cousin?
Shit's real out there, ain't nobody playin' round
I got some bangers and some druggies that I hang around
E'ry body do they own thing
And you can find me on the corner makin' money when it's snowing
I sell a lil' weed, get my pockets fat
But I talk to cats who be movin' lots of crack
It ain't the good life, it ain't the bad, it's just makin' the best of what we have
I'll put the dollars down and move into the lab
That's how much I want this music shit to last
And some days I feel it's movin' too fast
Schools gone pass, not remembering a class
Suddenly before you know it's time to grow up
Focus on the real, try not to get ya' hopes up
So far I've had some hard work and a lil' luck
Once I make it to the money, I ain't gon' give it up
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin'
I'm just makin' music, I hope you feel it
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with
So, what up cousin?Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
A marathon grind like I'm running from rest
It's 
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
But I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left under my chest
The streets empty 'round 5 o'clock
Driving by the cops
Low key microscopic to the eyes that watch
Everything a hustle when you trying come buy some guap
I'm a keep grinding 'till I'm shining like a diamond watch
Me and bo-head bringing you the truth
With all night sessions we just living in the booth
Strong bars like we spitting out 150 proof
Take shots, get loose, 'till you spitting up yo' food 
You see that? I'm a need a recap
Grab a weed sack chief that 'till my feet flat
I got this covered like a pro bowl d-back
Breathe rap and I been known to make the beat clap
Need cash so I'm trying to move some trees fast
Tell you where the meat at
Ask you where the cheese at
People 'round the city see the youngin' and respect the grind
Putting in the extra time
Guaranteed next to shine
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
A marathon grind like I'm running from rest
It's 
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
But I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left under my chest
I rise before the sun come up and get my day started
Pray to the most high, I roll up my haze and spark it
And then my paper starts to roll in
Money in paper bags
Hammers with laser tags
We grown men
Out on the corner 'till the early morn'
The blood of a hustler getting mines before I was born
You get stormed by these hot ass bars
From me and Easy Mac
Crusin' in the 'Lac smoking weed with no seeds in that
There ain't no reason that these other rappers hatin' on us 
Except these labels anticipating and waiting on us
They get the BBS's, radios play us
Then we blaze in the Benz's
And sit this off on BBS's
And from P.A to Texas
These niggas know about me
International hustler can't move no snow without me
Or get no dough without me
Niggas getting they stacking on
Early bird get the worm
I'm out here at the crack of dawn
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
A marathon grind like I'm running from rest
It's 
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
But I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left under my chestBetter mix this right motherfucker, haha
Yeah, that's right, y'all
Let's get it
Haha
Haha
 Let's get it
Let's get it
Uh
I got girls in the palm of my hand 
And they all wanna call me they man 
But I'm out for the dough, hoes piff
Girls on my dick like a pogo stick 
Go up and down, up and down 
Now let me see you drop low and touch the ground
So who wanna fuck me now? 
I know you heard that I'm fuckin' around
Listen, numb nuts, fuckin' with them young sluts
Bust nuts on they mouth and they guts 
Get dome in the back of the bus
I ain't askin' to touch, just pass me the Dutch
Smoke a L while I'm gettin' my cutty 
Hit a ho, put my dick in her tummy 
For the money chips like Nestlé, text me
Every single day for the next week
Hoes won't leave me alone 
Just bone and I'm leavin her home 
East to her own, no teeth with the dome
Girls always wanna try and creep on my phone
Don't rest, never will the sex end
Next night, I'll be hittin' up her best friend 
First impression got her undressin' 
Sextin', sextin', sextin', sextin' 
You come like a Smith & Wesson 
Nausea, heartburn, indigestion 
No question, damn, I'm free
Fuck every female on your family tree
Uh, can't stop crushin', since the sandbox
Get a handjob from your grandma
Ha! Are you down for the truth?
I'm gettin' brains right now in the booth
After this jam, drop her off at her house
But now she's busy with my balls in her mouth 
Ha, go and talk to me now
Psych, keep your lips on my cock for a while 
That's degradin', I'm not hatin' 
This music for baby makin' 
Spittin' rap in the sack, bitches with their titties flashed
Sick as that, gettin that strap with the Jimmy hat 
I don't want no H.I.V. 
Easy Mac, girl, taste my cheese
Stay rubbin', no bustin'
Pussy stay flooded, end of discussion
Look good, had to put her in a thong
Sex so crazy, had to put it in a song 
All night long, got it on
In the morning, gotta drop her at her mom's
 Young-ass ho, yeah
Easy Mac, The Class Clown, motherfuckers 
Droppin' soon 
East End Empire 
 been blowin' me the fuck up
 You stank-ass bitches, ha
Ayy, ayyBob's dementia
Chapter one
Now here lies a great man, a man of the people
A man of the people, people 
Yeah, here he comes, it's the highly unprofessional
Hyper sexual, intellectual
Fried my brain, now I've become a vegetable
Travel with a gang of weird lookin' extraterrestrials 
They left me on their ship and made their bitches call me "General"
The dick quake could make a bitch shake like she got Parkinson's
You out there politickin', I'm studyin' Darwinism 
I keep some bars and hit 'em like a hard collision 
Don't fuck around it's murder in this art exhibit
And I got the whole game on paralyzed 'cause my volume on amplified
It's slow as a biracial bitch that's waitin' on her hair to dry 
Are you prepared to die? Burnin' this Ameri-fry
Where people that protect you are the ones that have you terrified
I only act this way 'cause my soul so broken
I'm the illest that you know, you a low dose Motrin
Laryngitis, hepatitis, the AIDS virus
I guess that's what you get from bein' 'round a bunch of rat vaginas
And you , you pussy I wouldn't fuck with, a drunk dick
The day I came back from being hostage to the Russian mob
Missin' a finger and see my brother shot 
I'm comin' for your neck, so hide your head inside your mother's box 
It still ain't cliche to say, "Fuck the cops" 
Let's try it 
'Cause I just smoked a bunch of rocks and walked around in just my socks
And made myself a birthday cake with caramel and butterscotch
Tasty, tasty, that shit is tasty
This shit is tasty
Nigga, smoke
We servin' faster than the Chinese
This life carries a price cheaper than clown feet
Like prostitutes with hoops and combined weaves
Who hates herself inside
So she sellin' her punani by umami 
It's like my soul's inside the bowl
I hold it close, 'cause I don't know when it's my time to go
I'm blindin' fold, I hear my son laughing and time is froze
And he knows it, lookin' at me like "That's my pops," and I'm his goal, nigga
Motherfucker, I hit pockets, pickpockets
I'll beat you for your keys, bubblegum, and your bitch wallet
To his product, I'm a prodigy of a dead nigga
No name droppin', scribin' when nobody was dead meat when they came flockin'
Brain doctorin', where I left my hard dates
Small shakes and small dates, the ones I only call late in parlay
You know what the dark say, grab a bitch by the paw, ayy
Her name's Autumn, she happens to be fallin' on the wrong day
Nigga, tasty , tasty
Tasty, that shit is tasty
That shit is tasty
Tasty, tasty, tasty, tastyThis our only chance, I gotta catch a flight
I know you got a man, but can I borrow you for one night?
Baby, all I got is one night 
I see you dancin', love to play them games
But spend the night with me, your life ain’t gonna be the same
It's just one night, baby, all I got is one night 
Uh, uh, uh, ha, ha
I know you got a man of your own 
Stayin' at home while you dance alone 
Takin’ pics on your camera phone
Internationally known to be bad to the bone 
Girl, I can take you out of here 
Off to another whole atmosphere
We can take a trip, no need to make it quick
'Cause we ain't even gotta come back this year 
Now what do we have right here?
Baby girl wanna get nice, alright 
Don't fight, though it don't seem right
All we gonna have is tonight, alright 
Let's make it somethin' to remember
Nothin' feel better than a happy ending 
I know you want me, and I want you too, so stop pretending
This our only chance, I gotta catch a flight
I know you got a man, but can I borrow you for one night?
Baby, all I got is one night 
I see you dancin’, love to play them games
But spend the night with me, your life ain’t gonna be the same
It's just one night, baby, all I got is one night 
Ha, ha, ha
Girl, let’s take a trip, make a wish, I bet it'll come true 
You know wassup with me, I'm tryna see wassup with you 
Just want you for the night, then after that I'll let you loose
All the liquor in the world, so tell your friends to bring the juice
And we can mix it , chase it 
Girl that’ll like to taste it
Don't got a lot of time, and baby girl, don't wanna waste it 
Come hang with the kid , I'ma make you feel rich 
I can tell that you's a freak by the way you swayin' ya hips, so
This our only chance, I gotta catch a flight
I know you got a man, but can I borrow you for one night?
Baby, all I got is one night 
I see you dancin', love to play them games
But spend the night with me, your life ain't gonna be the same
It's just one night, baby, all I got is one night 
One night 
One night 
One night 
One nightYeah, yeah, yeah,  yeah, whoa-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Um, yeah, yeah
Back when I used to wake up first thing
Lookin' for a text sayin', "Hello, baby"
And when I didn't see shit
Wasn't no secret, that used to drive me crazy
I hit you on some freak shit, on some flirt shit
On some, "What you doin' after work?" shit
"Can I take you out to dinner and dessert 'til it hurt?"
I'ma merk shit, I'ma merk shit, I'ma merk shit
My God, you drop
My jaw to the floor, fall apart
My squad, know all about you
I'ma let you lay down all the ground rules 
I'ma break, I'ma sign the cast
Numb all the pain that the mind relax
We could fuck through the day
'Til we tired and passed out
It's good when the time is passed down
When you feelin' all alone
Dial that number, call my phone
You can do your job from home
It ain't a race, okay
We can waste today
Ground rules, ground rules, ground rules, ground rules
Keep me up night and day
Somethin' to numb my pain
Glow like the light in space
Hurry up, girl, ándale
Let's get this on the way
Put it on my tongue, just taste
Think I'm gon' run away?
Baby, ain't no fuckin' way
When you feelin' all alone
Dial that number, call my phone
You can do your job from home
It ain't a race, okay
We can waste today
Ground rules, ground rules, ground rules, ground rulesSlow down before eveything change
24/7, I say, "Things are lookin' up"
But I could be drunk, I just—
Hold onto my arm one time
If you get dizzy, that's fine
Just don't get stuck
Yeah, and fall, and fall
Watch it go
Down, down, down, down
Like a brand new submarine
Uh, lovin' you is takin' its toll
Tell you everything that I know
But it don’t mean much
When we're in a rush
Just, thinkin' of takin' it slow
We can  'til the sun come up, uh
And watch the sun come up
Now watch it go
Down, down, down, down
Brand new submarineOperation failure to launch
Operation failure to launch
Good vibrations, take what you want
Patiently wait where you are
I'm comin', I'm runnin' to you for eternity
Doctor, fix me up, I need awaken
Her eyes are closed, my dreams are vacant
Plans we made, they must go on
Don't be afraid, I won't be long
My operation love
You hold me down, she picks me up
Don't let me drown
Into the clouds, I'll find my home
When I'm with her, I'm not alone
Occupation love 
Oh!
Occupation love 
Standing ovation, pledge to this nation
Dream of creation, what are we waiting for?
Yeah, time wasting
Reality with a few modified-cations, God behind Satan
I musta, musta saw faces
Hell's gonna come before it changes
 Obligated to tolerate the evil
Planet over-populated by the people
But I see you when you're disguised
You be keepin' it live
But I got you where I want you, I be deep in your mind 
Love is among us and I'm seein' the signs
You too strong to move on and leave me behind 
I love you, girl, you know that
I found peace inside you and I don't wanna go back
My operation love
You hold me down, she picks me up
Don't let me drown
Into the clouds, I'll find my home
When I'm with her, I'm not alone
Occupation love 
Oh!
Occupation love Oh my 
Oh me, oh my
Yeah
Muah!
I told myself I'd never do cocaine, I told myself I'd never do cocaine
I told myself I'd never do cocaine, I told myself I'd never
Okay, yeah
I never leave the house without a rain coat, it's fatal
The eye of the storm is tryna tango 
When I say "Go," race me to my gravestone 
Welcome to the late show
A true loner, carryin' a bolder on my shoulders like it's nothin'
I'm comin' from deception and seduction
Buggin', hallucinogenic druggin' through customs
Wonderin' what's life without destruction
I'm a functionin' drug user
The feelin' that run through ya
You wanna be numb, do ya?
Somethin' that fuck you up 
I told y'all I ain't a role model 
First you lose your mind, then your soul follows 
Full throttle through the city, dodgin' pot holes
I want no trouble, I'm just tryna find the crossroads
I'm awful, when I die, bury me in fossil
Bury me in polo with a hundred in my nostril 
My motto is, "Fuck tomorrow"
Only God knows I'm not home
Probably sellin' drugs inside a Costco
Watch close, optical illusions and complex wit
Don't get tricked, the head trip will turn into a death wish
The high is deceptive
The mind playin' Tetris, follow signs to the exit
Hexes for my exes, I'm savin' them from the wreckage
Confession, all my regrets
I just hope I get into Heaven, I'm gone
Stood before death when he told me, "You are next"
Waitin' 'til the storm gets gorgeous
Then the Lord said from his '62 Corvette
"I'll see you when I see you," that's a sure bet 
I'll still be here sittin' on my porch steps 
Bumpin' Alanis Morissette
Do it big as Neil Diamond's forehead
I'm havin' more sex than a porn set, sinner
Lights dimmer, I'm a wizard
Hit Pittsburgh for the winter
Get trapped inside a blizzard, damn
It's Larry Fisher, man 
Here he go with this again 
A new day with the same high 
Nothin' on the agenda, I'm watchin' paint dry 
It's okay to waste time, go and take five 
Not in over my head, I'm just waist high 
I pray to God I can fall asleep
Sick of these annoyin' talkative sheep
A bunch of hustlin' llamas sellin' me fleece
Hopin' the gyro taste better in Greese 
My dad told me I'm a werido
I told him, "Shut up, I'm a fuckin' superhero!"
When I grow up, I hope I'm Robert De Niro
Except Hov would pick the phone up
Worry 'cause I love coke so much
Well, now my nose sucks
I still pour up in the soda
I guess it make me think I'm Yoda, uh
Hit the red carpet in a toga
Piece of paper and a tie, ticonderoga
I just wanna put my dick in Omarosa
And say she fired unless she make me a mimosa
That shit better be good too, bitch
That shit better be good too, bitch
That shit better get me drunk too, bitch
Better cover that shit with two lips
I ain't talkin' 'bout the flower, I'm talkin' 'bout your mouth
Just give me the power, woo!
This my house, I don't shower, and I wear a blouse
Change every hourYeah, um, alright
Okay, check, alright

Faithful to the end
She says I'll never be
Faithful to the end
So I'll try and be
I'd like to be her very best friend, aha
Uh, look

A bunch of old girls that I swept under the rug
So before you shut me out, first let me explain
'Cause I'ma keep you warm when the temperature change
And I'll try my best to stay true 
I really hope that I can stay faithful 
'Cause you the type of girl that I prayed for 
I'ma wait outside for you when the rain pour
Here's my crib, let's take a tour
You layin' on my bed like you gon' make it yours 
You taste sweet like a peach when we deep in the sheets
When I leave I'ma try my best not to cheat
'Cause never would I lie, deceit you 
I wanna be the other half that completes you 
Not only fuckin' but goin' out to eat too 
I was prayin' that I would meet you 
Faithful to the end
 She says I can't be
Faithful to the end
She says I'll never be
Faithful to the end
So I'll try and be
I'd like to be her very best friend
Let's go, look
Man, you know the ways of the rap world 
I don't even have to holler at girls
They just approach me, tellin' me they know me
It's all just a circle like Ring Around the Rosie 
So I don't listen to hoes
I just smile, laugh, let 'em hit up my bros
'Cause I love it when you kiss me on the tip of your toes
When I take you out, you know I'm bringin' a rose, and
It's apparent, you can meet my parents 
Mark and Karen, let's try not to scare 'em
And I'm recording this with a smile
Pick up the dial 'cause I ain't seen you in a while 
Hard to believe it's true
But right now all I want is you 
So, baby, you can holler at me
Forget about your pops, you can call me daddy )
Faithful to the end
She says I can't be
Faithful to the end
She says I'll never be
Faithful to the end
So I'll try and be
I'd like to be her very best friendComing from the city where we rep them Steelers
On be summer months I’m iller than Godzilla
Yeah my skin vanilla, I’m hotter than Chinchilla
Hittin’ Vegas for the night and cop a villa
Get my lyrics from L, and my sould from J Dilla
Chllin’ with the sour cause southern smoke’ll kill ya
I’m just me, tryna cover all these magazines
And bitches dressing up for me like it’s halloween
A little old school flavour when it’s germ on the drums
Thoughts to bullet points like its words from a gun
I’m spittin fire and it’s burning my tongue
Bitches wanna fuck and they heard that I’m young but they still do
I’ma stick around call me mildew
Go an stay in Bel-air like uncle Phil do
Get rich goin’ buy me a mansion then get my parents a nice crib in the HamptonsCrusing through the city with the windows down blowing
Through a pound ready for another round
Some hoes in the back of the whip and they rollin servin
Pussy like the U.S Open blowin on this
Potent different flavors I done saw em all I be stayin
Higher than the Taj Mahal straight epic
So now you can't forget it kickin girls out the crib
Like they got some bad credit when you blowed
And you drunk and you dont give a fuck take this soul
And this funk tell the Dj turn it up purple
Stuff got it stirrin in my cup while ho*es I get around
Like the wheels on the bus im'a true player
Original mac and I keep the pussy poppin here listen
To that hoes showin me some love so im givin

Go on and ride me like a swing set, Go on and ride me like a swing set, Up and down, up and down, Ride me like a swing set
Ride, swerve, thats how you do it in the burbs
When you high off the herb and you fly as a bird
With some horny hoes waitin in the burbs
You gotta go, lookin fresh with the cap on
And your girlie still wet from the last song
Ladies like mac miller ooh I wanna merry him
If it's sex and drugs then I'm heroin
I Pick her up just to ride around

Loud like a banger
Lil Mama lip gloss
Mouthful of flavorTurn up a little bit, yeah
First song recorded, in a hotel studio
It got me feelin' like I made it and shit, haha
She tells me that she don't know who I am
I've changed so much and she don't understand
Got me sayin', "Goddamn"
What made me this way?
And I been thinkin' that it's takin' way too long
Everything I do they think is wrong
I must move on
What made me this way?
And everything better when you make a little bread 
Countin' my cash, keep the numbers in my head 
King-size bed in my hotel suite 
I know I got money every time I go to sleep 
But, what made me this way?
I used to be regular, now I'm insane
I used to cry, now I don't feel pain
Hey, what made me this way?
They watch me as I figure all this out
Money comin' in, I tried my best to keep a count
But there's no doubt
That made me this way
And they try, but never will they know the work I do
On my grind all night, the moon lights up the room
A dream come true
What made me this way?
And everything better when you make a little bread 
Countin' my cash, keep the numbers in my head 
King-size bed in my hotel suite 
I know I got money every time I go to sleep 
But, what made me this way?
I used to be regular, now I'm insane
I used to cry, now I don't feel pain
Hey, what made me this way?
Countin' my money, couple thousand every night
Thinkin' to myself, "This can't be life"
Everything I'm seein', this can't be right
They must've poured a little lean in my Sprite
That's alright, that's okay
Fuck tomorrow, we here today
Hey, shit don't change
What the fuck made me this way?
And everything better when you make a little bread 
Countin' my cash, keep the numbers in my head 
King-size bed in my hotel suite 
I know I got money every time I go to sleep 
But, what made me this way?
I used to be regular, now I'm insane
I used to cry, now I don't feel pain
Hey, what made me this way?What's the matter with you?
Don't be sad
It's going to get better
Yeah, I'm from a place where the sun don't shine
Mistakes that I made— do 'em one more time 
Outta space, I been up so high
So much hate in the world
But the love I find is worth it
And I ain't perfect
Need a telescope just to find my purpose 
I've been coloring outside the lines 
I've been coloring outside the lines
And I need—
A new car to come with a new house
Taking it too far, what do I do now?
Baby, just cool out
Pick you up when you down
You feelin' stuck, why don't you move on up?
Okay, my mind is dirty— my whiskey neat
Are you in a hurry? Are you in a dream?
Be you, we can only be us
Little bit of love— shit I don't need much
It's going to get better
Love comes around the corner
I know that you've been waiting so long
So long for life to go on
Just hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Good morning! Yeah
Maximize the time you have to find the path
The smile hide behind the iron mask
I'm alive, I'm alive and well
Will I die?  Only time will tell 
Take a journey, find yourself a meaning
Am I worthy? I am just a human being
Full of secrets, stupid dreams
Return to miracles like turnin' steering wheels 
Pray for a life like this
Bunch of fake friends and a high price bitch
What the limelight is, I'll be fine
See my mind when I'm wind
I've been blind to the signs I miss
Yeah I'm—
On my prime time shit
Don't even know where the sidelines is
Gotta little bit of weed and a sci-fi flick
Left a bitch, get her off of my dick
Motherfucker, God— damn
It's going to get better
Love comes around the corner
I know that you've been waiting so long
So long for life to go on
Just hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, be strongPathological Liar
Went to my girlfriends house and set her dog on fire
Blamed it on her little brother, got him sent to juvi
Fucked her in the bathroom while her dad was watching movies
Reach in to my backpack for a fully loaded UZI
Started shooting up the room he was in
That Chapelle show episode, you know, Paule Mooney was in
Told her everything would be alright
Just don't scream as I dismount
Left the crib
Started searching for a discount
Exorcist I need to get some help with this
Once as sweet as  is, think he went insane tho
Must have been the drugs in him, he love to sniff the yayo
Insane could accompany a angel
But maybe one day I can be somebodys angel
Catalog with greatest hits
Sacred does what sacred is
And people raise their brows
When you weird as Al Yankovich
I just wanna make out with groupies and play with tits
Snort H and shit, just forget what day it is
I'm eating Seder with Clinton and Ralf Nader
Trading Acres and betting millions against the Lakers
Spitting out what used to be a children's favourite flavour
Sentenced to hell but I'm out on good behaviour
Oh shit, got a new neighbour
Pause - Humming "The Star-Spangled Banner"
Still alive in a room full of melted candles
Lost my job, now I'm in New York selling sandals
Saw Christopher Stokes and SW Randall
Introduced my youngest cousin to him, told him he was DTF
They probably had some freaky sex, really I'm not worried
Already plan to kill myself when the clock hits 7:30
Reading Hamlet out loud in a room by myself
Giving different characters different voices
I think it helps
Storyline flow of the plot
Got a gun in my dresser
It's holding a shotMr. Rogers
Why you wanna see me now?
Is it because I'm on TV now? Yeah
My haters wish they could be me now
Thank the Lord the tables turned
'Cause now it's my turn
When I used to be dirt broke, I couldn't afford to get a Happy Meal 
Now it's steak and lobster, that's a make-a-player-happy meal 
But back then, you were lookin' at me and laughin' tears 
Now I'm rich and you steady tryna get yo' ass up in here 
Tell me why I couldn't get a ride when I needed one
Now it's so many cars, it's like I never needed one
Allergic to bitch niggas, never see me with one
Want deeper life until Jesus Christ and his kingdom come
The same musty ass egghead sixth grader
Y'all were laughin', but he knew later, shit would get greater 
From broke as a joke, now he's earnin' as much as six Lakers 
Save yourself, bitch, I'm savin' this paper 
I turned that green and trappin' into that black Bentley ballin' money
Always got at least fifteen stacks with me
And you can ride as long as you ain't got your hand out
Soon as you ask for somethin', that's when you get yo' ass out
Why you wanna see me now?
Is it because I'm on TV now? Yeah
My haters wish they could be me now
Thank the Lord the tables turned
'Cause now it's my turn
Yeah, okay
Black car service
Had to kill myself to be here, was it all worth it?
Spent a lot of lonely nights contemplating purpose
Only did it 'cause I'm white, do I still deserve it?
Hell yeah
I put a lot of work in, thank the Lord he blessed me
First time in Houston, Bun took me to Frenchy's
I'll put a couple albums out, then they'll all forget me
But a gangster gon' always be a gangster, boy
And you don't know my past, you weren't right there wit' me
Hittin' licks to get some cash, just to buy some hash
I'm a rottweiler, top dollar, Babe Ruth, shot caller
Grand slam, head of the table, I'm the Godfather
Burn it to the ground, pickin' up the pieces
You can't save yourself when the beast is off the leashes
'Cause we comin' for you
Yeah, we comin' for you
Why you wanna see me now?
Is it because I'm on TV now? Yeah
My haters wish they could be me now

Welcome to reality
It's either this or your fatality
I am gravity, I am your majesty
I'm the truth and that's a reason that you mad at me
I'm the source of all your power, I'm your battery
I can either be the end or be your masterpiece
I can either be a friend or be a casualty
I am your addiction, you are attached to me
You try to run away, but always comin' back to me
Good and evil, I am duality
I'm the creator, I am God inside his factory
I'm blasphemy, I'm standin' on the edge
And there ain't a place I'd rather be
Yeah, you have a dream, you have a dream
But if you not ready to wake up, then go back to sleep
Open up your eyes, yeah, you have to see
Fuck rulin' the world, I want the galaxy
It's time to wake up 
Good mornin' 
Good mornin', motherfucker 
It's time to wake up 
Good mornin'

Everything is on purpose, on purpose, yeah
Everything is on purpose, yeah
Everything is on purpose, on purpose, yeah
Mmm-hmm
Hell yeah, okay
You can bet I never tell a lie in my songs
You fakin', how the fuck you coming flexin' with a Scion?
I'm buyin' anything I put my eyes on
No bygones, no motherfuckin' bygones
You need to do better, I keep it hot, I choose weather
That's God level, solid, I'm all metal
You soft Jello, I am flyin' higher than falsetto
What's on special? Short bus dropped to the floor bus
Full course, got her pussy wetter than pool shorts
They waitin', never playin' like the side of the hoop court
Decided to do more, I'm runnin' my own shit
I know I look fantastic, I'm so happy you noticed
You should focus on yourself, why your lips so loose?
You talk a lot of shit, but you don't sip no juice
High on opinions, but you low on funds
Shit, it's my time and it's your time of the month
Rhymin' ain't really nothin' but boredom
I just absorb, then I'm on
Gee, I'm exitin' orbit, but more importantly
I'm gettin' up every mornin'
Too many squares in your circle
You way too out of proportion, so act accordingly
Normally I'm torn between good and bad
How I'm 'bout to knock 'em down, uppercut, hook or jab
I ain't seen this much food since back in cookin' class
Let me see what else inside this goody bag
Everything is on purpose
Temperature is risin', my hand is on the furnace
Adventures of a dyin' breed
I was way too high to even try to see
But finally, I'm glidin' on the surface
JuJu on Burfict, lights out, picture-perfect right now
Not concerned with your bullshit, pipe down
I might just pull up to the White House
Shit... Unlikely
The president say my name again, he gotta fight me
I ain't puttin' that politely, that's word to Spike Lee
Somethin' don't seem right, not at all
Little tiny-ass pants, why your pockets small?
One foot in front of the other, I'm 'bout a hundred tall
Overkill, Jonah Hill numbers with the Moneyball
I called a lot of shots, missed a bunch of calls
See the phone, Al Capone is so silent
Home on a solid gold throne, when in Rome
Tell 'em all, "Keep quiet and please leave me alone"Hey Pimp!
What up DJ Pimp?
The Ill Spoken
East End Empire
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania all the way to France
Lets go
It ain't nothing to stunt when you rap like the kid do
Kick you in the face, taijutsu
Shit, you ain't smokin like I'm smokin, boy my piff's blue
High with my dogs while you posing with some shih tzu
Not an issue, I'm going right past you
Flowing like my cash do, y'all be eating cat food
The way I spit leave you still like a statue
Boy I got nine lives like a cat do
Flow's nuts call it cashew
The castle of Pittsburgh, twisting miraculous killer
Up in Pittsburgh, down to France
With some honeys and they no pants
The big money, living like a king money
Dream 'bout what you like but don't take a thing from me
I can tell your mommy, your auntie, and your uncle
I come with music, real smooth with that funk soul
Yeah, I move it like a trooper do
Two for two, dude for dude
Ain't nobody out who do this shit like I do
It's like I'm through with the Subaru
Honda Civic, not Pacific
Opposite of everybody hoppin' on my dick, I said it
Better slide, get inside before I set aside
Little slither on the grass, like a snake so sly

King of the jungle bitch I'm Madagascar
Don't aggravate him cause I don't have the patience
Send you home early like a bad vacation
Fuck with hoes that been struck with infatuation
But I be on the road and have em waiting
Escape from reality, life is just a fallacy
So we ride the clouds round skipping through the galaxy
On the Millennium Falcon you see me traveling

Homie life is a game and you loosing

Rolls-Royce fantasies staying in condos
For now living lavishes on hold
If you wanna play the game then go pick up a console
It's not slow cheddar, it's nachos
I know my path while you turning in wrong rows
Hype like pom-poms, tied into some Long Johns
Finally some brand new gear that I got on
New shoes and some twenty dollar socks on
Me and my people stay connected like a dot com
They say I blow a contact I'm a car bomb
I'm just finding me a target I can lock on
Nobody can do it exactly like I do
Cause nobody I know got my life or got my crew
They try to, telling me I'm you
Probably don't understand but you will when it's time to

Stop, look, and listen, my key is in the ignition
Start up, swallow my pride, pick my heart up, I be so driven
My motto is "Never follow," I'm runnin' into tomorrow
With all the weight on my shoulders like boulders
Still never borrow your hands
There ain't no problem, this is part of the plan
I'm in here until I disappear, they'll never see me again
It was way easier, I didn't need a reason for comin'
People don't need me for nothin'
I feel that deep in my stomach, I keep on peelin' this onion
Too many layers to it
I'm makin' music from a soul that's full of aches and bruises
I don't feel safe, I just feel numb, I don't feel shit
I don't wanna die here, please don't leave me like this
I keep that weed in my spliff
Long as I'm breathin', no quittin', I will not cease to exist 
I am no genius, just a hand that's on my penis
Produce semen you spit
And you wonder why I'm bein' a dick

So fight, fight for the right to party

Always was a robber
In my neighborhood all day like Mr. Rogers

In a flash, getting change like a vending machine
Then I'm out, pocket of piff, hop in the whip
Head to the first dip at the top of the list
Roll in easy got you drinks for the free

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything , other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I can spend whatever  on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up 
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up 
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up 
And I say the same thing every single time 
I say, you the fucking best, you the fucking best
You the fucking best, you the fucking best 
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fucking best
I used to be a player who was searching for the one
Scared of being me because it was hurting me to love
But then i found something that i thought was real
You know the type of girl you could cop a meal for
See life is real good on the come up
I used to hit my lady with a text when the sun up, like what up
And i gave it all away just to fall
Now i'm waiting on the day when she call
Nah fuck that, because nowadays love is always lose
My heart's staying bruised if i'm giving it to you
So i'm a keep playing girls like they was a instrument
Trying to find the one is just ridiculous, i'm sick of it
Because i found out that every girl the same
They saying that they victims but they love to play the game
So i ain't feel ashamed for who i am
And love don't really drive me to do these jams
But i'll tell y'all everything i write about
All the ups and downs then the smiles and frowns
The good, bad, ugly, funny, and the money
The honeys, the grumpy, the hungry, whatever
Because my life has never been better
She can't break what's underneath the polo or my sweater
And that's my heart so fuck a heartbreak
This was just a little case of some heartacheThis next song right here is a song called REMember, alright?
It's dedicated to a homie of mine
Let's go
I said, I hope you're proud of me, dude I grew to be
Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
Going through memories
Like they were movies scenes
I know I've been the shit
All these people full of me
I admit I guess I'm full of myself too
There's just a bunch of shit, I wish I could tell you but
This life moves fast, I never knew that
Yours wouldn't have lasted, the dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stops
For now, I need to run to any place with a train stop
And everybody wanna talk to me
About some business shit
Never really listening
Couldn't get real interested
My days get darker, so the haze get sparked up
Hate, sound the same
When my name get brought up
You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up
So I could meet your son and talk you up 
Y'all holding up the lighters, I appreciate y'all man
Light up the sky for me again
Said I remember when we were just kids, woah-oh-oh-oh
We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived
In West Virginia, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Lost somewhere out in West Virginia
Yeah
Said it's a dark science, when your friends start dying
Like how could he go? He was part lion
Life goes on, tears all dryed in
Couple years are gone by by then
I said
Can you please help me find my friend
I'll give you anything you need
Multiplied by ten
I heard he moved to a place
Where the time don't end
So you don't need money
All you got is time to spend, I'm saying
Life is short, don't ever question it's length and
It's cool to cry
Don't ever question your strengths, said
I recommend no limits, intricate thought
Go 'head just give it a shot
You'll remember shit you've forgot
Cause way back then I didn't know shit
And I don't know shit now
So when the world's looking hopeless
I'mma still hold shit down
Said I remember when we were just kids woah-oh-oh
Y'all take one hand and put it real high in the air like this
We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived
In West Virginia, woah-oh-oh-oh
Lost somewhere out in...

We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about this life we lived
In West Virginia, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Lost somewhere out in
West VirginiaUh-oh, uh-oh 
Shit got me feelin' funky up in here

From nothin' to somethin', bumpin' the system, gettin' it jumpin' 
All my ladies , where you at? 
I'm postin' up, bring that ass to the back 
I'm comin' back  and they lovin' it 
Got a bunch of cash, tell me where the honeys at
Nah, tell me the money at

Runnin' tracks like I run it back 
Givin' bitches wood like a lumberjack 
Uh, what's crack-a-lackin'? Mac is rappin' for your satisfaction 
Back in action, and my shorty's ass is clappin'

But we gon' keep it jumpin', we gon' keep it jumpin'
I know you want it bad, girl, stop frontin' 
Oh, I ain't a player, I just crush a lot 
And you know that the kid gon' hit the spot
The fortune, fame, gorgeous dames know the name 
When they hearts even know they know the game 
Play my cards right, see, the kid control the game 
Beat bangin', leave you with a broken frame
They let the beast out the open cage
Spoken flame, and there's always more dough to make 
They try and say that they hardly know 'em
That's okay, keep that party comin' 
We gon' keep it rollin', it's four in the mornin' 
Tell them hoes that the doors still open

Tell them hoes that the doors still open 
'Cause the party jumpin' all night 
Tell the DJ the party jumpin' all night
I get that bang for my buck with some drank in my cup 
My swagger's on point every day of the month 
Good haze in the blunt got me zoned out 
Go see your party, kick you out your own house 
'Bout to go down with some chow 
Shit is poppin' off , it's gettin' wild
Uh, I'm at the party right now with some women 
And the crowd, they go wild while I'm spittin' 
Freestyle or a written, I'ma get this shit poppin'
Stayin' so fresh like I'm dressed for my coffin 
This not a option, it's a way of life 
So tell my moms a couple honeys 'bout to stay the night 
And I hit the spot in the AM, blazin', then hazin'
Headin' to the stage to give a taste of amazin' 
If you get your swag down pat, come and rock with me 
And ladies, I'll be right here, come and talk to me 
We gon' keep it rollin', it's four in the mornin' 
Tell them hoes that the doors still open 
'Cause the party jumpin' all night 
Tell the DJ the party jumpin' all night

We gon' keep it rollin', it's four in the mornin'
Tell them hoes that the doors still open
'Cause the party jumpin' all night
Tell the DJ the party jumpin' all night 
We gon' keep it rollin' 
That's how it go down, y'all
Teenage wasteland
Party jumpin' all night, motherfuckers
We don't sleep, I ain't sleepin' in weeks
It's cool though, 'cause I've been wasted
Haha, what's up, Mom?What if I never make it?
What if I'm never famous?
What if, I'm broke
And my whole life been a joke?
What if nothin' ever happen?
What if I gotta stop rappin'?
What if, what if, what if this is it?
What if I never get the chance tell the world what I gotta say?
And when I die, all I do is just ride away
I try and talk about my life in every song
So you have a little somethin' to remember when I'm gone
I tell it like it is, I ain't pretendin' that I'm on
But I tell you that I'm workin' and I'm gettin' very strong
It won't be long 'til you hear me on the radio
But in my head I got ways to go
But I'ma take it slow,  is the way to blow
So any place I go, I know my bank can roll
The old heads are schoolin' me, I'm takin' notes
I am hip-hop, it replaced my soul
If I sink to the bottom, then I'ma make a float
I heard the real world's cold, I'ma take a coat
Be prepared, and be aware 'cause failure ain't really even there
What if I never make it?
What if I'm never famous?
What if, I'm broke
And my whole life been a joke?
What if nothin' ever happen?
What if I gotta stop rappin'?
What if, what if, what if this is it?
Expectations peakin', they wonder what I'm 'bout to do
Spark interest, music, I can count on you, right?
But do I have it all twisted? I went from popular to misfit in an instant
My friends forgot me 'cause they probably seen me hardly
In the lab when I should be out at a party
It drive me crazy, and money is the fuel
Insomniac, awake, findin' somethin' I can do to put the work in
And I'm certain that I'm flirtin' with the fame
Failure gettin' jealous, throwin' dirt up on my name
Burnin' up my brain, but I'm workin' through my pain
'Cause life's hard 'til you learn it's just a game
Play your cards, use your letters on your Scrabble board
If you small, put your heart into your rappin' more
No money? Why the fuck you countin' for?
A thousand truants tryin' to get up my allowance more
What if I never make it?
What if I'm never famous?
What if, I'm broke
And my whole life been a joke?
What if nothin' ever happen?
What if I gotta stop rappin'?
What if, what if, what if this is it? 
I got you right where I want you
Now you can't get away
You try to find, a way I wanna break out
You can't get away but trapped in this so
Grab your seat belt, fasten it
Girls keep me on them Facebook status
Repping for me like a activist
Now I don't have to spit, I just choose to
With some words that will move you concept confuse you lose you
Intelligent with etiquette never let it get better than mess around with a medicine
Sentences with a predicates
I take action no use relaxing
Curses that I'm casting got them all wrapped in my spell
They say he rapping so well
Light a square up right after the L
I'm smoking come roll with me
It's potent got a whole O to chief
Teacher's like Mac can you focus please
But y'all ain't control of me
 
I got you right where I want you
Now you can't get away
You try to find, a way I wanna break out
Look, young Socrates, thinkin' so prolific
Critics give a fuck about my business
No gimmicks, I talk it how I live it
Told God that this gift is a privilege
So thank you for blessing me with talent
My neighbors and my fans think I'm chemically imbalanced
Move on with new songs, beasts getting chewed on
Wake up bake up put my shoes on
Money got you shady if it's too long
Act crazy the he going to do wrong
Right where I want you, in your brain ima haunt you I got you
 
I got you right where I want you
Now you can't get away
You try to find, a way I wanna break out
The most Dopest overly devoted
Young mechanic making everything that's broke fixed
This a simple routine so focus
I'm just watering the flowers no lotus
It's magic when I spit, go hookas pookas
The game is full of clay ima mold it
People that I roll always ready to protect me
A lot of hate coming towards an MC
Ain't nobody friendly out for them own chips
I'm so sick epidemic like a cold hit
My team running it now, Most Dope clique
A lot of rappers in the game but they don't fit
A long journey to the top but I won't quit
Got delta in his hand, don't fold it
Keep it pushing don't let yourself get stuck
I know your momma never told you to give up
 
I got you right where I want you
Now you can't get away
You try to find, a way I wanna break outCountin' up the minutes that I wasted
I could use a little motivation
Somethin' that's gon' get me out of bed
So I don't blow my brains out, I go and live instead 
I don't need you to call my phone
Tell me that I have somewhere to go 
Oh no, I'd rather just be alone , oh, whoa
Well, this world 
This world is crazy
I don't lift a finger 'less a motherfucker pay me
I remember always comin' up short
Like a 5'4" motherfucker on the court
And now these people wonder, "Who that?"
I miss the nuts and bolts, I got a loose cap but scrеw that
This forward, never move back
I'm layin' nеw tracks like brand new weave
Watch me go to work, oh yes, I'm rollin' up sleeves 
Swear that my intentions are correct
I would mention my perspective is intelligent
So yes, I have a bit of trouble bein' benevolent 
I let the chip fall off my shoulder, I'm so—It's so irrelevant 
My past is my past, I move past that
Don't hold onto shit, I ain't a motherfuckin' pack rat
Coach, put me in the game 
Swear I need a switch-up, every day is like the same, I'm...
Countin' up the minutes that I wasted 
I could use a little motivation 
Somethin' that's gon' get me out of bed
So I don't blow my brains out, I go and live instead 
I don't need you to call my phone
Tell me that I have somewhere to go 
Oh no, I'd rather just be alone , oh, whoa
I'm keepin' track of all this time, but it's slippin' away
I get you loose, spillin' juice with every minute I made
Some bad decisions, but whoops
I went from sittin' on stoops, watchin' the days go
To sittin' at the head of the motherfuckin' table 
It either make me stronger or it's fatal
In that case, put some diamonds on my halo
So I can shine, fly high, I climb
Recently been feelin' like my mind ain't mine
I don't know why sometimes I let my head get the best of me 
Wear this crazy life  like an accessory
Freshest on the motherfuckin' planet
But this planet too complex for me to ever understand it, so 
I belong, Han Solo
Glass walls, throwin' stones like Quasimodo
And that's all folks know, that I'm goin' loco
Can't blame it on the coco no more
I need my mojo, 'til then, I'm...
Countin' up the minutes that I wasted 
I could use a little motivation 
Somethin' that's gon' get me out of bed
So I don't blow my brains out, I go and live instead 
I don't need you to call my phone 
Tell me that I have somewhere to go
Oh no, I'd rather just be alone, oh, whoa, whoa Yeah, and it goes like
Hey, hey, hey, hey, and I tell em' fuck youuuuu if you hatin'
So fuck youuu, we makin' money bitch
That's all I really got to say
I'm just gunna start rappin' and shut the fuck up !
Blaow
I said they actin' like they better, but they never been the shit
Hows it feel to have a hundred thousand people on ya dick?
Well, it feels good, homie you should probably try it
If you never rocked a sold out show then keep quiet
I gets busy on a track, workin' double time
Tryna find a foreign pussy just to put my tongue inside
I be on top of the charts, you just an underline
Tearin' through the streets all these hatin' suckers run inside
Furious, fool probably wanna come and stomp me out
Mad they got a girl, and I’m all that bitch talks about
Been gettin' money since I walked around my fathers house
That dads be cop and search when I come and take their daughters out
Paper comes in large amounts, Im eatin' like I should
Surf and Turf shit, sink my teeth in somethin' good
They mad I ain't hood, nah I came to party hard
Your grillin' at me but I smile back, bitch hardy har
Come on down, grab your girlfriend down, make her spin around
Ain't no other motherfucker get the people this wild
What you want? some futuristic funk
Tell me what you want? a little futuristic funk
We those kids gettin' cheese on some Cheetos shit
Just fuckin' for the night, then we leave that bitch
So what you want? some futuristic funk
Tell me what you want, a little futuristic funk
Hey, so you probably heard I rap a ton, havin' fun
Never have I had a gun
Vomit when I spit like I devoured somethin' bad for lunch
Tryna figure out the way to get me rich, I have a hunch
Like Velma up a Scooby-Doo, confusin' like a Rubix Cube
Usually don't do this I be stupid just a nuisance
All you seem to hear about, I’m in ya ear, q-tip
Yeah that's dude sick, sleeve with a few tricks
Breathe in a huge spliff, weed come in two zips
You light it then I burn it like a furnace when the herb hits
Like it cause I earn it smokin' good veggie turnips
Bitch I'm fallin' from the sky like bird shit
Makin' movies everywhere I go, call me Ernest
Come on down, grab your girlfriend down, make her spin around
Ain't no other mothafucker get the people this wild

I'm in here talkin' shit, don't be mad mothafucker
I'm gettin, I'm gettin, I'm livin' great, your not !Yeah
Well, my good days are exactly like the bad ones
My bitch say that I defy the laws of attraction
I've always been terrified of endin' up normal
Things that we all search for end up findin' us
God is like the school bell, He won't tell you when your time is up
Shit just end up workin' out, why do we wonder why it does?
Yeah, so I asked God to take me on a perfect date
Swear I saw him cryin', don't know why everyone sure it’s rain
Education's shiftin', but I feel we only learn from change
Every time I think about it, shit just starts to hurt my brain
Problems we can't solve always seem to be my favorite ones
Life just gets so borin', playin' superhero makes it fun
So why is "heroism" so close to "heroin"? 
We are what we believe in
There is no such thing as freedom
But what can we do?
What can we do?
'Cause I see the light at the end of the tunnel
It feels like I’m dyin', dyin', dyin'
I'm dead
Yeah, they tell you that you need to sleep and suddenly you do
Scared you gon' wake up as someone who isn't you
We've all been down that road before
Poured alcohol on open sores
Nobody can hurt me if I go inside and close the door
Not scared of growin' old and dyin'
Feel this where the answer lives
You wear the garments
Everybody needs to dress some manikins 
We are what we believe in
There is no such thing as dreamin'
But what can we do?
What can we do?
'Cause I see the light at the end of the tunnel
It feels like I'm dyin', dyin', dyin'
I'm dead
Make some noiseYeah
Haha
Haha
They ain't got it, they ain't got it like we do
Gettin' honeys, smoking piffs, stackin' cream too
It's just the life of a PA hustla, and y'all mu'fuckas bustas
They ain't got it, they ain't got it like we do
Gettin' honeys, smoking piffs, stackin' cream too
It's just the life of a PA hustla, and y'all mu'fuckas bustas
Okay you're a goon, what's a goon with no profit?
Broke as fuck sittin' with an empty wallet
One dude lemme come in, boy I got this
Everybody jumpin' around like it's a mosh pit
I drop that hot shit, you drop nonsense
And my money long like the center for the rockets
I get that chronic, that Cali weed roll a swisher pass to me
Smash a beat, work of art, masterpiece
Game on lock and key, nobody stopping me
Got some haze and Patrón, 'bout to pop a bean
Now I'm rollin' like a 16 wheeler, and my money fat like its 16th meal bra
Your favorite rapper's, favorite rapper, that's the game I'm after
Getting cheese like we play the packers cake and batter
So be careful 'fore you hook to the IV
I be chillin' in the P-to-the-I-T
They ain't got it, they ain't got it like we do
Gettin' honeys, smoking piffs, stackin' cream too
It's just the life of a PA hustla, and y'all mu'fuckas bustas
They ain't got it, they ain't got it like we do
Gettin' honeys, smoking piffs, stackin' cream too
It's just the life of a PA hustla, and y'all mu'fuckas bustas
My swag official like a referee no one on the plane is stayin' fresh as me
Boy I'm dressin' clean, denim jeans sittin' low on my waist, and haters get a cloud of smoke blown in they face
My fam beside me, fans behind me
Sorry ma but it's money over punani
I'm super fresh, make your lady lose her breath
It's hard not to take a Ralphie but I'll do my best
Rock your head and do your step, move it to the left
Where you can find me posted up in my Gucci vest
Boy I'm getting paid, then I'm getting laid
Don't tell the hoes at the party that I'm in 11th grade!
Ain't nobody out there fresh my age and you best believe
That's why I got 20 honeys sittin' next to me
Child celebrity, gotta be me
Cause my swag stayin' clean like a washing machine
Fuck y'all
They ain't got it, they ain't got it like we do
Gettin' honeys, smoking piffs, stackin' cream too
It's just the life of a PA hustla, and y'all mu'fuckas bustas
They ain't got it, they ain't got it like we do
Gettin' honeys, smoking piffs, stackin' cream too
It's just the life of a PA hustla, and y'all mu'fuckas bustasStill can't seem to figure out
What happens in my head
Thought alone is gonna kill me
Sick of livin’ with this doubt
This pistol in my hand
I could end it all before the mornin'
Summertime always gon' come around
I’ll be waitin' for another smile
Devil, lift my feet off the ground
Tryna hold on, but gravity won't let me go
This gravity won't let me go
Whoa, whoa
This gravity won't let me go
The devil always smile when you need a friend
I'm layin' on this cloud
It's a long drive back to earth
Wonder when my happy days will fade away
Don’t rain on my parade
If it’s only for this moment
So gravity let me go
So can you please let me go?
Let me go, oh 
Will you let me get higher, higher?
I just wanna get higher, higher
Wanna get higher
Said I wanna get higher
Said I wanna get higher
Let me get higher
I wanna get high
Said I wanna get high
Gravity, can you let me go?Said, it ain't about money
I could show you the world, girl
What can you do for me?
We can take a vacation, go somewhere in the country
Turn the radio on, hear my song sayin' 
My favorite song say 
 She slept through the future
Missed it, it was yesterday
So we , right , back where we started
She still tryna get away 
Girl, you wastin' my time , and I am wastin' your time
But that's okay 
Said, it's okay 
Let me give you what you want, ooh
And maybe later, what you need, yeah
I remember, girl, you used to have fun, yeah
Though I ain't seen a smile in a while
Heard you feelin' pretty lonely, yeah
Your daddy shoulda got you that pony
Let me give you what you want
Killin' yourself like this, goin' crazy, keepin' all of these secrets
How is that livin'? 
Every time I reminisce, I keep thinkin' it was better then
I remember when we made , out , underneath the rain clouds
Stay , out , late, I wanna lay down
Break , ground 
And you tell me  
 And we could be okay
Don't know for sure 
Just familiar numbers glimmer through your door
You left home right away 
'Cause your life is like night and day 
You keep goin', goin', goin' back and forth
Let me give you what you want, ooh
And maybe later, what you need, yeah
I remember, girl, you used to have fun, yeah
Though I ain't seen a smile in a while
Heard you feelin' pretty lonely, yeah
Your daddy shoulda got you that pony

A love song
In the key of Lex Luger
Deeper than pink
I didn't even mean to break your heart
So lemme put it back together
It's funny 'cause I kinda thought that this would last forever
I been goin' through the pain, miss when this was at it's pleasure
"I love you" sounded better then, now it's just repetitive
Sippin' on codeine, girl, that's my sedative
'Cause I can't sleep alone
When you needed me at home, I wasn't there
Fightin', yellin', you tellin' me, "Nothing's fair"
Girl, I got a heart of gold, and trust me, there's enough to share
Chillin' in your underwear, we gon' do some fuckin', yeah
And after that I'll tell you how I'm so in love with you
Lay on top your comforter, fuckin' 'til the sun come up
Bubble butt, smack you on the ass after I bust a nut
Don't call you, "Honey,"  but you sweeter than the candy
After Halloween and Valentine's Day, both put together
You never gon' find one better
This love for you last forever
Incredible, take you to festivals
When you in bed, fixin' your hair
You know that I love it curly
I love it when you wake up in the mornin'
And if it's early, we may fuck a little
Take her ass to sleep
I like what I see, I hope she take a likin' to me 
My drink is deeper than pink, but she hate that
Wanna smack me in my face, be like, "Take that," haha
But she been my girl since way back
And I don't think it's ever gon' change
My drink is deeper than pink, but she hate that
She can roll up all my weed, tell me, "Face that," haha
She been my girl since way back
But still, I don't ever wanna change that
My drink is deeper than pink and she hate that
She love to talk to stray cats
Find an address written on their name tag
She innocent but smart as well
Deadly as the harm she felt
She either tell you, "All is well," or "Rot in hell"
All depends on how you wanna treat her, so I try my best
But, bein' who I am will have her all upset
And I don't know what I should do
'Cause I been born to make these moves
I just hope that I can fix her with a call or text
All unless, it's complex and difficult
Tryna figure out if it isn't or it is my fault
She keeps to herself, locked somewhere deep down in the vault
Place I haven't been at all
Where the strong survive and the cripple fall
Here, let's talk out in the hall
I just wanna know what's on your mind
Not only 'cause I love you, but I'm interested to find
What's behind those two eyes
I like what I see, I hope you take a likin' to me 
My drink is deeper than pink, but she hate that
Wanna smack me in my face, be like, "Take that," haha
But she been my girl since way back
And I don't think it's ever gon' change
My drink is deeper than pink, but she hate that
She can roll up all my weed, tell me, "Face that," haha
She been my girl since way back
But still, I don't ever wanna change that
My drink is deeper than pink, but she hate that
Wanna smack me in my face, be like, "Take that," haha
But she been my girl since way back
And I don't think it's ever gon' change
My drink is deeper than pink, but she hate that
She can roll up all my weed, tell me, "Face that," haha
She been my girl since way back
But still, I don't ever wanna change thatYeah
God damn
Alright, it goes like
Bitches on the table, bitches on the floor

When we drive by slow they know who the fuck it is
Reach they arms out to the street, try and touch the whip
They wanna be us, they
They wanna be friends
They wanna see what we be doin' on the weekends
But you can't live my life, boy
Uh, you can't live my life, boy
Sleep on a plane, wake up in a different state
Rock the stage, get paid and off to a different date
College boys come up offerin' me their haze
And hoes be approachin' me offerin' me some brain 
I can't complain, people show me love 
Actin' like they know me, but no one really does 
I say "What up?" and appreciate support
But if you sparkin' conversation, please just make it short
'Cause I ain't got time for no monkey business 
I stay on the grind for the money in it 
I know I'm cool, I definitely rhyme well
Tellin' jokes to these hoes: Jerry Seinfeld 
See you boo, you can come and meet the crew 
No one makin' moves like me and Q 
And Big Will got the triple Es locked down
I got all your lil sisters on my jock now
At the bar, no I.D. on me 
Every girl's eyes be on me
Approach 'em, "Why you so lonely?
I'd introduce myself, but you already know me"
Now ride, just coast
Roll the windows down, see the smoke
When we drive by slow they know who the fuck it is
Reach they arms out to the street, try and touch the whip
They wanna be us, they
They wanna be friends
They wanna see what we be doin' on the weekends
But you can't live my life, boy
Uh, you can't live my life, boy
Almost famous, see me standin' on the rooftop
High like some tube socks, puttin' on a jukebox
Billboard status, y'all know my face
'Cause I got buzz like a phone on vibrate
Take what's on your plate  put it on my plate
'Cause I'm hungry and I don't got time to wait 
I like my ladies fine, kinda how the wine taste 
Hit it from behind, that's a blind date 
See, the life of a fly boy funny 
Always try and multiply more money 
Yeah, I'm cocky and they love it, too 
Walk up in your crib like, "Who the fuck is you?" 
Sike, try and be a little modest
'Cause I don't have enough paper in my wallet 
Parents think I'll be somewhere in a college 
But I disagree, I'll be somewhere livin' prosperous 
There's a lot of things that I ain't got yet 
Way we progress kinda hard to process 
How I'm so young, such a prospect?
I'm still crawlin', I ain't even start to walk yet 
Now ride, just coast
Roll the windows down, see the smoke
When we drive by slow they know who the fuck it is
Reach they arms out to the street, try and touch the whip
They wanna be us, they
They wanna be friends
They wanna see what we be doin' on the weekends
But you can't live my life, boy
Uh, you can't live my life, boy
"What up" "The ultimate

Take something for the pain, make a deal with the devil
You just gotta sign your name, on the dotted line
And all you'll see is dollar signs, God is good all the time
Good and evil, walk the line
Couple suicidal thoughts tend to cross your mind
But everything will be alright-alright-alright-alright

Shit I graduated call my name, see the cap and gown
And I was stressin', I was goin' through depression
I just had to learn my lesson, but I'm feelin' pretty happy now
Shit that had me down, same shit I laugh about
What go around always come back around baby
I turn my life around, that's a one-eighty
Don't give a fuck, I just been havin' fun lately
Went a little crazy, lost my mind
My homies had to come and get me

Dealin' with old pain, c'mon just put your smile on
Standin' in cold rain, cryin' the whole day

Thoughts are cynical, actions unpredictable
Super models bitches hold auditions in my swimmin' pool
And this feelin', is feelin' pretty invincible 
Pray this life reciprocal and I'ma come back an eagle
Thirsty for evil, the wine chilled in Hell 
I gave my life to this shit, already killed myself
No-no-no-no-no
We ain't the same homie 
The world afraid to change but it changed on me 
Always been the realest keep the same homies 
So that bullshit fades slowly
It's goin'
Goin', goin, goin', goin' goin', goin, goin', goin'
Will you follow? 
Where are you goin'?
Watch it go, go, go, where are you goin' for real? Go, go, go
Where are you goin'? Go, go, go, go, go, go
Okay
Gone-gone, gone-gone
Yeah
Okay I went to sleep famous and I woke up invisible
Rich as fuck and miserable
At least I did Kimmel and Aresnio, my mom got it on video
That's the shit I live for, all this other shit is trivial
Wi-wi-wi-will you bear witness to a miracle
I don't know, I'm not a kid no more, comin' for those residuals 
Be asleep in a couple minutes
My bitch have a nightmare, wake up, made me some cereal
She knows I love my cereal 
The sun come up, I gotta face that
Oh my God, here we go
I'ma blow it, yeah
Am I okay? Fuck no
Just so nuts so
Need to let the drugs go
Tryna find Heaven, I get high but never come close
We still, wonder why we'll never learn to love
It's because, all the air is filled with gun smoke
A middle finger to the cyber Gods
Fall back or I'ma fuck around and let this virus off
In the mud, fuck your brainwash, I'm signin' off
Pain killer God with an upload
Yeah
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Where are you goin'? Gone
Do you have a destination?
Watch it go

Ha, East End Empire
Let's get this one real quick
Trick or treat, muhfuckers
Yo, look
I'm pickin' a fight, deliver this, finna get rid of your life
Isn't it nice? I'm rippin' it once, it's hittin' you twice
Ghost deliver it nice, so take it as a present 
Fuck sittin' in college, I kick this knowledge for the lesson
It burn ya chest, the words are blessed, confuse and bring ya questions
'Cause with my complexion , a fingernail could cut the tension
And in case I didn't mention: spittin' it better than anyone did it before 
I'm rippin your corpse , dippin' and lettin' you live in the morgue
Shit on the porch, trick or treat, I'm here to piss on the floor
And if I didn't come with the whip, I'm gettin' in yours 
On Devil's Night, we bless the track
Mischief, so we rest from raps
Steal your soul, snatch your heart, laugh and let your chest collapse
I'm dressed in black, ready to run up inside your crib
Smack you upside the head while you sittin' beside your kid
I laugh 'cause your son's in my history class
Make him cry while he see his dad kissin' my ass 
Spittin' razor sharp cancer, so I'm pissin' out glass
Sit and relax, you bitches stay and live in the past
And here's a toast to me and Ghost
We be the dopest with this rhyme skill 
 explode like you wander through a minefield
Time kill itself, clock blowin' out his brains
'Cause you are the Average Joes and John Does without a name 
Yeah, hand over them candy bags and all that shit 
Okay, yo
Aight, yo
It's like now for a word from a motherfuckin' scholar 
Late October, homie, I was born a monster 
Blowin' on that ganja, just listen, don't hate the rhymes
 and them dimes 
I'm Frankenstein, brother
So I wonder what the talk's about, playa, watch your mouth
A small amount of Ghost will turn your crib into a haunted house 
I'm on your spouse, dick on her blouse, jizz on the couch
I put you on game 'cause in my brain, it's stickin' out
So pick a different route, you 
A slender cat, I'm one of the skeletons in your closet 
Our shit is speculator, see you still MC Dracula
Still approach beef with the spatula
The black cat scratches like NASDAQ
I'm past crack, I  duckin' in tents
They might despise, I see a fire and I'm 
We got the nicest lines and 
Yeah, y'all know what it is
Hey, Ghost, let's give 'em sixteen more 
Of this straight hip-hop monster shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
East End Empire, let's get it
I'm ready to vote, my  and dro up in my bags
Got a scale to weigh it out, my paper route, I'm gettin' cash
Crew is  for you healthy rappin' clowns
Smack you down, crack your crown, 
You don't wanna talk shit to us 
We live to bust heads with these fisticuffs
Then dap you like, "What up?" , just to pick you up
'Cause we splittin' cup while you spittin' butt
Matter fact, your clique is  
 ridiculous, knock you out with the verbal
Smellin' , twist it up, cook a track, whip it up 
Hook that ass, fix him up
I think I'ma skip the shit you spit, nigga, I'm into 
Yo, let's wrap it up
I think we made a point and that's enough
Ghost and Mac is rough, so muhfuckers start backin' up 
Man, your squad is  enough
Don't start actin' up like your sinuses and vagina lips
I'm inclined to spit
Yeah, all day, man
East End Empire, The Ill Spoken, The Scholars
I see you 
What up, Beedie?
Big Will, all y'all, what's good?
Franchise
Oh, and I made the beat, bitchThey wanna know why I do it?
It's actually pretty simple
Haha, look
I do it for the music
I do it for the love
I do it 'cause my purpose is way more than just because
I do it for the soul
I do it for the funk
I do it for the people who used say that I'm a punk
I do it for the haters
I do it for the fans
I do it for the people who helped make me who I am
I do it for everyone
The world, the water up to the sand
The quiet kid in your school who wanna just be the man
I do it because I can
I do it because I love it
There ain't a better feelin' than to know your feature's done it
'Cause now, this my job, this what I live for
Every day the best day ever, still tryna get more
So I never take a day off
Every single game, gotta treat it like a playoff
Buckle up, we 'bout to take off
Heart and soul move us all
I just smile and remember what I do it for
Everybody wanna know what you doin' and why you doin' it
We livin' life, so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash
Everybody wanna know what you doin' and why you doin' it
We livin' life so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash
I do it for the generation, all the kids who 'bout to grow up, run shit
Put our thumbs in the air and the blunt lit
Feelin' like I can do it in my sleep
But I'm workin', gettin' better, thinkin' 'bout what's out my reach
Hopin' that it's nothin' but I'm hopin' for discussion
How I crashed into the game and nobody seen me comin'
They saw a youngin who just love what he does
A brain behind the face and a heart behind the buzz
I keep it real, ain't got a reason to lie
Just mention me when your favorite MCs come to mind
I'll bless a rhyme if you give me the time
In Pittsburgh, I just want my whole city behind me
'Cause "We" is who I do this for
Soundtrack to life, this a movie score
Buckle up, we 'bout to take off
Heart and soul move us all
I just smile and remember what I do it for
Everybody wanna know what you doin' and why you doin' it
We livin' life, so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash
Everybody wanna know what you doin' and why you doin' it
We livin' life, so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash 
Hey, third verse
Yeah, I do it, I ain't done yet
Do it for the crack of dawn and every time the sun set
You played all of your cards and got none left
I'm stayin' smart, strategic for what come next
Yeah, I'm ready for it, prepared heavy for it
That's why I do what I do and I ain't ever bored
If life a game, I got a better score
I guarantee you I'ma do this right here
I do this for the feelin' that you get when you hear the perfect beat
You know exactly what to say and all your homies holler, "Preach!"
We 'bout to take off
Heart and soul move us all
I just smile and remember what I do it for
Everybody wanna know what you doin' and why you doin' it
We livin' life, so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash
Everybody wanna know what you doin' and why you doin' it
We livin' life, so get used to it
You know just why I do it, you don't even gotta ask
It's bigger than the fame, boy, deeper than the cash
Yeah
My thumb stay up
'Cause at the end of the day, I know why I do it
We do it to be happy
We do it 'cause it's all love, you know?
Don't be mad at me

And let me tell you what you don't know , yeah
And you've been ridin' solo 
And I've been tryna tell you that you should come away with me
To the top floor 
'Cause you've been workin' way too hard for 
You to be unhappy, every day I put a smile on your face
'Cause that's the way that it should be 
I take my time with you
This moment could last forever
What's been on your mind?
For you upon the sky
And give it to you
I made this life with you
I hold you, we close together
There's no compromise
We stay lost in time
Baby, baby, here we go now, here we go now
Three-sixty on a merry-go-round, merry-go-round
Ooh, baby, baby, here we go now, here we go now
Three-sixty on a merry-go-round, on a merry-go-round
Yeah, you see me lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at you

Yeah, yeah, I see you lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at me, me
You know I see you lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at me, me 
Well, I take your momma to dinner, I take your sister to lunch
I was so happy to meet her, the bill, I'm pickin' it up
I drove you round in the Beamer, we take a trip for the month
And every time that I see your pussy, I'm beatin' it up
You leavin' me stuck, so all you do, keep-keepin' it up
I'm leavin' for work, I swear that I don't see you enough
And can you tell me 'bout your dreams, what you believe in and stuff?
I was waitin' for a "We," like, "When are we gonna fuck?", yeah
I take my time with you, forever
There's nothin' we can't do together, whoa-oh-oh
The queen
You could be my queen
My queen
YaAnd when its night time with the shine of the city lights
Same day different mic what you living like
Travel around the country always at the airport different flights
Its anything but the simple life
I break em off fuck a magistrate
And I laugh at hate
Revenge a dish served cold y’all can grab a plate
Grab a tape toward the money and the fame
But it ain't all what it seem boy just another game
No wii, xbox, or ps3 just good weed and some henny you can leave me be
Maybe find me in the west coast like ez e
They in a coma been asleep for weeks
But now they waking up
They notice that the youngin got skill
Ya im white but you can't put a color on ill
I got my own thing going for me
Sip lean so they move in slow motion for me
Just a juvenile but these vets moving over for me
Cold glass of henny so they go and grab a coaster for me
Life a fuckin roller coaster homie
Whats my name? bitch you were supposed to know me
Just forget all that bullshit mane
Leave it to the lames
Im just trying to make it in the game
I can do it all
Still gonna end up winning
That’s just what I saw
Right from the beginning
They gone change
I was built to be a winner
I was built to be a winner
Its just me and my team that’s all that matters yeah
Live my life right and just be happy here
Ain't no white light, bitch I got my whole life ahead of me
Architecture my life but you can't design my destiny
All the family that I lost, rest in peace
Wish you was here to see me catch my dream
Iv chased my shadow now im on another level
At the playground playing freeze tag with the devil
I ain't gonna sell my soul tho
This music worth more then hoes, boats, and polo
No college but bet I win the rose bowl
The way I smoke got my moms going loco
Live on my own now paying rent and shit
When life stress gets thick you need some sedatives
A little weed and a little bit of liquor
Make me forget about this bullshit im intoYeah , nothing's impossible 
We do this shit together, we unstoppable 
Raised to be a leader, not a navigator 
Wrote this down on scraps of paper
All roads lead to the same confusion 
I mean, all roads lead to the same conclusions 
Found my body somewhere in the sewer 
My girl defined the word 'prolific'  for me
And I can't read her mind, she wrote a different story 
Oh well, redemption is a funny bitch 
The devil always be right where the money is 
Somebody gotta be watchin' you but no one is 
It's kinda crazy life could be this simple 
Nothing's coincidence
My best friend packed his things and threw 'em in the car
I haven't seen him seen since 
I guess I understand he always got the chills
When he saw a room full of rolled up hundred dollar bills 
Yeah
Even pills turn to powder, baby 
Even pills turn to powder
The world wanna crush her down
Even pills turn to powder, baby 
Sit right next to me and crush 'em down
If pills can turn to powder, then this world could turn to ash
Everything seems so slow, but
My past, not that it would last longer
I just thought that, thought that, thought that
This feelin', this feelin' would last longer, yeah
Oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-oo-ooh
Oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-oo-ooh
Oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-oo-oo-ooh
Yeah, yeah
Somebody gave me a treasure map
Nowhere on that motherfucker say where the X is at
Now, I wanna see the whole world through a telecast
Waitin' my whole life, I finally thought I should tell you that, yeah
Started smokin' weed again, started tryna read again
Cleaned myself up, now would you be my friend?
Do I need to know the beginning to see the end?
What's the difference between a truth and things that we pretend?
I lie awake faded, watchin' days go by
And only at the lows do I chase that high
Fear God, stay humble
Original sin, we all come from the same struggle
What you gonna do? Money comin' slow
What you gonna do when the money comin' slow?
What you gonna do when the money comin' slow?
And you left out on your own
What you gonna do when the money comin' slow?
What you gonna do when the money comin' slow?
What you gonna do when the money comin' slow?
And you left out in the cold, whoa
Can I get four Norcos
Two Oxys, two Roxys, three methadone
Couple Percocets, some heroin
Two Xanax bars and six-ounces of that weed?
Thank you
Do when the money comin' slow?
What you gonna do when the money comin' slow?
What you gonna do when the money comin' slow?
What you gonna do when the money comin' slow?
What you gonna do? Money comin' slow, whoa
What you gonna do?If it was colors and shapes, the imaginary
Instead of all of this weight that we have to carry
Would you be able to breathe?
And if you could just find where that comfort resides
No distraction or movement that fucks with your mind
Would you let them see?
While beneath the ocean I met with the captain
Who sank to the floor on his ship
All of his passengers escaped to safety
But he was not done with his trip
He looked up and smiled, asked me ''how do you do?''
I told him I'm losing my grip
He told me ''son, if you want to hold onto yourself
Then let yourself slip''
Fall
Ooh
Fall
Oh
Fall
Oh, it feels good to fall
These puzzles are so hard to make into pictures
Of something that they'll understand
They could open their eyes, still be blind to the beauty
But march on the heart of this land
Oh oh, why don't you turn around and go home?
They invade your minds and then fill them with nonsense
These things that a man doesn't need
Take out the love and the passion and hope
And they fill it with nothing but greed
While floating through galaxies they said I couldn't
I noticed how sad one can get
Cause the ignorant mind is so peaceful I find
I can't understand nothing no more
If I jump let me fall
If I jump let me fall
Fall
Ooh
Fall
Oh
Fall
Oh, it feels good to fallUm
Shall we, uh
Take them to, uh, church?

The youngin spitting like tobacco sharper than a xacto
Knives, flow tighter than a lasso
Louis shades on, my movie star shit
Looking like I'm dressed for the fucking red carpet
You look like your outfit from Target
With a bitch that smells like an armpit
Damn that pussy stink, need to keep it clean
Do it like a kids movie
Homie keep it G, PG-13, TV big screen
Been getting money since the boy was 15
But I spend it when I get it q wanted me to save it
But I tell you wanna blow it when I make it
Used to drop verses in the dirty ass basement
Now I'm recording at places that Lil Wayne spit
Shit the future seem brighter than some neon
Bitch I'm just a dog tryna find a tree to pee on
Infinity and beyond beyond
Thinking you can beat me? Dream on
I'm so hard got more bars than a damn jail yard
You slow like them damn little snails are
Now you in space with the star
So just chill for a second play the background
Ha Ha
Its time to make room for the class clown...
I hear these kids and they trying to spit
But they sound so ass and I am the shit
No you got nothing on me boy 
You got nothing on me boy 
They tell their friends that they're gonna blow
Once they on the stage everybody go home
No you got nothing on me boy
You got nothing on me boy
Hey.. look.. ah
Labelled as a young man don't wanna get old
Little thing called hip hop stuck on my soul
Bumpin my shit coming up to a show
Well it seems this youngin here looking like a pro
Now I look fresh but I always had hoes
We just tell yea always had those
Gone so long now I'm coming back home
So many calls, gotta get another phone
Just to deal with the day-to-day routine
But I'll always make a little time to dream
Come with me you could learn a few things
No I'm good don't need a mood ring
Hey! Hip hop's little brother like Phonte
Little league no Danny Almonte
Bomb haze got me rising like Andre
Chilling, counting money with a couple of my hombres
I hear these kids and they trying to spit
But they sound so ass and I am the shit
No you got nothing on me boy 
You got nothing on me boy 
They tell their friends that they're gonna blow
Once they on the stage everybody go home
No you got nothing on me boy
You got nothing on me boyImaginary girlfriend, imaginary whores, imaginary virgins 
Imaginary Gods, imaginary evils, protect me with a cross 
Imaginary senses
Go and fight a war for imaginary vengeance 
My old bitch imaginary pregnant
Guess I'll be a dad with imaginary presents 
Pockets full of imaginary money, ask me how it feel
I imagine that it's stunning 
In my dreams, I imagine that I'm running
Very fast, away from an imaginary something 
Imaginary enemies
Live under my skin with imaginary tendencies 
Meet imaginary Suzie
Killed herself tryna reach imaginary beauty 
Imaginary, imaginary, imaginary, imaginary
Imaginary, imaginary, imaginary, imaginary
Imaginary problems
I like to close my eyes and imagine I'm forgotten 
Imagine I belong in this world with the rest of you
Imaginary goblins 
Asleep in this imaginary coffin
Finally get a break from my imaginary conscious 
Imaginary images
Killed a man in front of these imaginary witnesses 
Imaginary love
Trippin' balls, high off imaginary drugs 
Life and its imaginary sequel
Swimming in a sea full of imaginary people 
Imaginary lives
We kill each other seeking an imaginary prize 
God and his imaginary eyes
Watching what we do, I imagine he's surprised 
Imaginary, imaginary, imaginary, imaginary
Imaginary, imaginary, imaginary, imaginary
You sir, is it you?
I forbid you any entrance
There's pinks and blues and flowers and trees
All things you won't be able to enjoy
Where you're going
Because where you're going
Is someplace far from here
Enjoy the ride
Your shoes are untiedSour Hour, TreeJay
Most Dope, what's good?
I'm calm, cool, got a blunt, gonna roll up two
Don't panic, 'cause I'ma take over this planet  cut like a bandage
On the net, all up in your band with, no beaver
But Goddammit, this sour I smoke enhance it, got a helicopter, where should I land it?
Been searching but can't find it, the things I do is timeless
Where the fuck did this kid find this rhyme shit? Hit lime piff
Always see me chilling with a fine bitch, let her show me where her mind is
Then silence, it's private, so 
Want a Bentley and a big backyard, friendly but a big rap star
Still show love more bud to roll up, smoke duds so much to toke up
On a big cigar or maybe in the mood for a doob
If I roll one of these G's up, boy, you gotta roll one too
See I'm high but I'm stuck at school, don't know what the fuck to do
Uh, self-made, designed my own mind like a pair of custom shoes
So keep 'em fresh please, finna ball, 'bout to win an SB
Gretzky, unless  your spitting doesn't impress me
You walk but you got two left feet, drink vodka with my Pepsi
I'm drunk, you sober, I'm starting, it's over

You ain't a rapper if my homies never heard y'all
I just spit a punchline, smile then they bird call
Hit your sister in the face with a Nerf Ball
I'm dealing with some shit that really don't concern y'all
Punch a fan if you get a fucking word wrong
I'm wavy, giving you some shit that you can surf on
Finding me a bitch I can swerve on
Frank Thomas homie, 'bout to put the hurt on
Your bitch a night light in bed, she turned on
Roll some weed, tell her burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Okay, I used to give a fuck about success
Now I just want to see Mila Kunis undress
Hope she down for buttsex, it will be a cum fest
FUCK! Sorry that's some shit I had to confess
Crazy-ass bitch doing 911 threats
Came in the game smoking Newport Hundreds
Now I'm at the top and the crown fit, gold on my outfit
Surrounded by this pussy, I'mma drown in it
Got that wet pack, bitch come and give me that
You know we want to know where them titties at
Got 'em gassed, they be asking what I'm cooking with
Have your little brother ask your moms what a pussy is?
Corruption, stunting at the function

Pay attention, you'll learn something
Roll that weed up, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one

And I don't trust these bitches 
I made a movie and I made another one night before
I get money like I never got this money before
I need to check myself into a rehab, but no 
And I don't trust these bitches
Yeah, said I'm a motherfuckin' pioneer
He is I and I am here
Everythin' become a blur, feel like I've been high for years
Homie, I'll be hidin' here, the moon is out, the sky is clear
'Bout to run the streets, tell the feds to get the riot gear 
Comin' to destroy it all, burn it to the ground
With a middle finger up and my hand on my nut sack 
A light skin bitch to hide my drugs in her butt crack 
We gettin' money, tell me, "Slow down," sayin', "Fuck that" 
Soarin' in the '81 DeLorean, we ridin' out
All these bitches tryna audition, I be like Simon Cowell 
Never wind it down, for a better time is now
Swear I be killin' myself, I feel like Private Pyle 
Keep my rice in Chinatown, guess I'm goin' Hollywood
Pittsburgh blood in my veins, in there I'm always good 
Most Dope soldier, thought I told you it's forever 
You don't need a picture, just remember
I made a movie and I made another one night before 
I get money like I never got this money before 
I need to check myself into a rehab, but no
And I don't trust these bitches 
I made a movie and I made another one night before
I get money like I never got this money before
I need to check myself into a rehab, but no
And I don't trust these bitches
Again, okay, okay
Two days with no sleep, my eyes wide shut 
Yeah, I started in the nosebleeds, now the homies got floor seats 
I'm still rockin' only, I gave Clock the Rollie with the blue face 
Threw away my Louis V suitcase, it's everything Ralph, no BB gun 
A bitch to hold it down all the time, yeah, I keep me one
Mac Foley to the Mankind , game on landmine 
Trouble on my damn mind 
Hit me on the landline 
I'm Ric Flair before the thin hair 
Read Bukowski naked in a lambskin chair, stuntin'
Somethin' for your bitch ass
So tell me why your girl look exactly like Sinbad, damn 
They probably wanna put me in rehab 
Rather be somewhere off the coast fishin' sea bass 
Most Dope soldier, thought I told you it's forever 
You don't need a picture, just remember 
I made a movie and I made another one night before
I get money like I never got this money before 
I need to check myself into a rehab, but no
And I don't trust these bitches 
I made a movie and I made another one night before 
I get money like I never got this money before 
I need to check myself into a rehab, but no
And I don't trust these bitches
Yeah, free-free Suge Knight
Yeah, 'scuse me, we ain't bein' so polite
Sleepin' by the street lightsOh yeah, the God back, had the hits before they made contact
Aight bro, fuckin' with a psycho, you should stop that
Fuck rap, wall of plaques, stats leave 'em all shocked 
Wait for that forfeit, that's a long shot
We on top, it's a job and every day is nonstop
Been a boss, call shots, they prayin' I'ma fall off
Just an interview, all talk, fatality, I'ma finish you, bomb drop 
And bitches love the kid, I make her nervous
Got her, stu-stu-stutterin', all I do is fuckin' win
Issa giant, can I fuck your shit up? 'Cause I'm wildin'
That one is a motherfuckin' bride
Better quiet down, I'm standin' on the high ground
In the music world, wide renowned
I'm makin' money while I'm lyin' down
All these motherfuckers silent now
All I hear is crickets, all I hear is crickets
All I hear is crickets, all I hear is crickets
Yeah
And I piss art, comin' for whoever play me in charge
Fit inside your wallet like a motherfuckin' gift card
Everybody wanna ball and be a big star
It's interception, pick six, play the guitar
Do you wanna be the man? You could be a big shot
All you need is a plan and a little bit of dedication
I went away and kept 'em waitin'
Now it's back to record breakin' 
It only matters if it sounds good
When it come to paper, I'ma count books
Hearin' crickets, movin' units, sellin' tickets, fuck the critics
Made it way beyond my fifteen minutes, I'm on
And I'ma put in work 'til I'm gone
Who'd of thought, millionaire off of makin' some songs
Cold motherfucker, you could feel the snow
Run your mouth, I don't hear you though
All I hear is crickets, all I hear is crickets
All I hear is crickets, all I hear is cricketsCome on, oh, come on
Come on, oh, come on
Come on, oh, come on
Yeah
Oh shit
I said
I'm posing a question: how many been empty and holdin' aggression?
Close to depression, open your eyes and just focus a second
Fuck a recession, my brother, my mind is my weapon, I'm lettin' it go
Loaded and pointed at negative energy tellin' me stop, they tellin' me, "No"
Your aura is something you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, whores got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feeling come after the shock, praise me, I'd rather you not, 'cause
It's drivin' me crazy, the fact that you pay amaze me, that's somethin' I love
You come to the club searchin' for drugs, drunk, fuckin' these sluts
God loves me, what if he does? What does it mean?
You wastin' away doin' nothin', you frontin', why aren't you chasin' ya dreams, uh?
We wonder 'bout life but none of us willing to learn
The money we earn something to burn, why won't they give me a turn? L
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?
When them high rollers homes in Vegas raided with some home invasion
Contaminatin' the place with plague, we just saved the day
I waste away in a room spittin' out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm givin' it back,

Of our time to be alive

It's a gift
Of our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
Forfeitin' the war, he lays his sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store, begins to contemplate
Dealin' with death like he work in the morgue, absorbing souls forgotten
He lost his way, starin' down that barrel, thinkin', "Not today"
Life's so precious, said, Lord knows that life is so precious
Fight to the death 'til there's nobody left and you holdin' your breath 'cause you might get infected
I'm animalistic, instinctively thinkin' of getting ballistic
Be specific, to those in control we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, intertwined
My trigger finger itchin', all I kill is time, bang
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shootin' lasers
'Cept I'm cool with Vader and blowin' up rooms that's full of strangers
A news anchor the youth can relate to, it's nature
If you a hater I'll deal with you later, no, thank ya
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors
Really doe, come on, homie, we major
I waste away in this room spittin' out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back

One, two, three, so throw your motherfucking
Hands up, your hands up, throw your motherfucking
Hands up  said get 'em up 
So throw them hands up, said get 'em up 
Get 'em up  get 'em up 
So throw them hands up, said get 'em up 
So throw them hands up, said get 'em up 
Go  go  go  go  go 
Go  go  goBut don't give, but don't give
True love finds you in the end
But don't give, but don't give
True love will find you in the end
I told you once that I made it 
That everything would start changin' 
Been wakin' up when it's rainin', but I ain't one for complainin'
And I ain't one to tell somebody what to do
With their own life, own life 
People say what I should do with mine
Well, that's the shit that I don't like
I go nice with that numbness 
Me usin' drugs with my crutches 
Got purp inside of these Dutches
Double cup and that's what I fuck with 
'Cause everybody got substance 
And everybody addicted 
Everybody got a life to live
But not everybody go live it 
I seen some people conflicted
They lose their minds to these riches 
Testin' all of their limits then burnin' all of their bridges
How beautiful are these women? 
But I be callin' them bitches 
And I be fallin' a victim to
Everything in their system 
I'm tryna tell my own story 
Tryna make up my own mind
So why you tellin' it for me? 
Pick on somebody your own size
Don't know why I'm so high
On a blind hunt for that goldmine
I look more, one more time
What happens to a star that don't shine?
Don't be sad 
Don't give up until 
True love will find you in the end
I'm goin' back and forth in my head
No, I won't sleep 'til I'm dead
My thoughts run like they off the leash
With shit I need to confess
I'm sick of thinkin' 'bout stress
My family think I'm a mess
'Cause when I'm not at my best
Why does everybody obsess, sayin':
"Get a little bit of exercise
Get a little bit of time to refresh the mind"
And, and I guess I'll testify that
I've had some better times before 
When will I learn to let it go?
I'm not tryna be emo 
Still love a bitch with a deepthroat 
Still ballin' like a Marino
With my homies watchin' Casino
People on the damn internet think I'm doin' blow by the ski slope
Fuckin' hoes with a trio 
They know nothin' 'bout me though 
I think often, feel blessed
Live life, but I know death 
Work hard, progress
Let it go, don't stress 
Diplo gave me this beat
Said, "Spit though" 
Lookin' out my bedroom window
Wonder when does all of this go 
Don't be sad  
Don't give up until 
True love will find you in the end 
Don't be sad  
Don't give up until 
True love will find you in the end Ahem
Microphone check, one-two, one-two
Hey, haha
I figured I'd get funky for a second if that's okay with y'all
Uh-huh, uh-huh
It go, it go
Hey, hey, look, uh, yeah, yeah
They probably used to this Jewish kid foolin' with the music shit
Ludacrisly move a bitch, she feel it in her uterus
I'm generous and clever with this effort, so intelligent
Sentence wreckin' in seconds, invest in it for the hell of it
Tell a bitch she outie if you smell a fish, hell no
Hand her soap and tell her, "Go and get it fixed"
Never hear the end of it
Laughin' with your friends like some degenerates
But be nice, these females' feelings are kind of delicate
Never get the etiquette
Boy, I'm a asshole
Five-star restaurant, smokin' green tobacco
And TreeJ only eat it with Tabasco
He never try that tuna-noodle casserole
Ha-ha-ha, he-he-he, what the fuck was that?
Mothafucka, I'm skiid
Learned to smoke weed before I ever learned to read
Hey kids, you can be just like me
And now we go front, back, side to side
Everybody just glide
If you gettin' high, throw your hands in the sky
And do that shit one more time
Say we go front, back, side to side
Everybody just glide
If you gettin' high, throw your hands in the sky
Tell the person to your left that you're fly 
So fly, baby, buzzin' like an insect
Buggin' every track that I infest, been best
Simple intellect, feelin' that I've been up next
Feeling all the interest in puttin' all the hate to rest
No atheist, but self-made
Great team, we just trying to get ourselves paid
Never been on E, all my boosters pump gas for me
Gassed up like a Hummer for the summer
And everything I did was a runner for the numbers
All the critics got a woody, the foundation with the lumber
Fronters, will never get no shine
Y'all struggle through life, and we just gon' glide
Hop on the bandwagon, squeeze for the ride
Trees for the trip, beans for my high
Reach for the sky, yeah, it's worth a try
But you still couldn't touch a man this fly
And now we go front, back, side to side
Everybody just glide
If you gettin' high, throw your hands in the sky
And do that shit one more time
Say we go front, back, side to side
Everybody just glide
If you gettin' high, throw your hands in the sky
Tell the person to your left that you're fly Ye, Listen to the Ill Spoken
Yo, yo let me get this real quick
Alright mac, so come around
Ye, let's go
I focus, on bein' the dopest, to hold a mic
I'm cleverly ending enemies lives with words that I recite
There'll never be anyone better than me
Contenders tendin' to be settin' the scene
The rookie but still the best on the team
See these cats like sex in a dream
Yall spit the good but ain't nothin' is real
I'mma cut off all your fingers spit you something to feel
Cuz you ain't, touchin' the real
I'm spittin' ideal, it's surreal
Yeah, welcome to the City of Steel
Where you can find me kickin' back
Pirate hat, twisted back
Pen and pad, on my lap
I'm sippin' on a Pabst
I'm a menace to society, Dennis would admire me
Burnin' through more rubbers than a tire be
See i speak figuratives
Spittin' with metaphors and irony
Variety of ivory to ease my anxiety
The young masta pass the rules, they don't apply to me
The game got me messed up and taken what's inside of me
And I'm a, take it from there
Never playin' it fair
Got the throne up in my way until i'm makin' it there
And as far as I'm concerned
Shit is vacant, so I'm breakin the chair
On the ground is how I'm makin it, chyeah
Thinkin' about how much cake that I can make in a year
Few grams I'm movin' grams, not a day I can spare
Hear the jam as i play in my ear
Psssh it's hot like fevers
Hustle hard, sellin' pot to feeders
Dippin all across the block
Cops holla if you seen us
Me and EZ Mac come back like we was jesus
We stayed skeed and my trees is the greenest
I keep a buck sixty in my jeans
I'm a genius
So, heed this when we puttin' it down
We speak ill, reekin' hell
Leave you shook from the sound
I stand tall with my foot in the ground
So if you doubt me, come and see what im about
Come in to my town
So come around, come around
Come around, come around
Into the underground
Come around, come around
We so sick, we got that hunger sound
Come around, come around
Come around
So bet it's going down
Come around
Cuz we breakin' all sets and we takin' the crown
I spit with authenticity
You can't get within the width of me
Surround me by the definition victory
You think you lava, then my line-up that some shit to see
Speedy flow its sick i need to get some antihistamines
The mista mean, the mista please
I know you pissed at me
I'm beatin' up you beaters
And dismissin' you a mystery
Leavin' haters history
I'm hurtin' you cowards
Heard him out, word him out
Cuz I'm a person of power
The TV said I couldn't curse
I spit a verse and devour
We Ill Spoken
Spill minds, rhymes, it's still potent
Battle us at real times
Try, you'll feel broken
They quotin', but we fire, my rhymes is still smokin'
Fo real folks, you better reckon the flow
Cuz yo I'm comin' through your section and I'm checkin' the pros
You better know
The mecca we the best in the show
The record explodes the second I'm lettin' it go
Check it, respect the method
Man I wreck it
I said it
With an eccentric sentence
The apprentice, will not stop spittin' till I'm breathless
You ain't feelin' me
Feel free to use the exits
To other mc's that know me to preach
Gonna spend my history to eat every lyric you willingly speak
You still gettin' beat each and every battle you havin' with me
The champion, you bringin' to feat
The fat lady singing the C
Ain't nothin' change, I'm a do what the game never does
With clever stuff i'm the rapper that there never was and never will be
The kid with that ill speech
Not quittin' unless you kill me
Nah, ill probably still be
Spittin' from the grave, my flow mindless
And no need of a brain
Simple and plain
The kid will remain the best in the game
Hittin' your chest with flames
Remember the name
Or we came, i'm at your second game
So come around, come around
Come around, come around
Into the underground
Come around, come around
We so sick, we got that hunger sound
Come around, come around
Come around
So bet it's going down
Come around
Cuz we breakin' all sets and we takin' the crownWhat up, Jerm?
Haha, ayy
Stop bitchin', stop bitchin', stop bitchin'
Stop bitchin', stop bitchin', stop bitchin'
Shit ain't gon' change, ain't nobody gon' listen
Y'all need to just stop bitchin' 
Uh
Yeah
Mac got your favorite sentence 
These other bitches just table tennis 
Put some weed with some rice in this Cajun
That spicy Jamaican, I smite you for hatin'
Rap shit's nice, but I might need some 
I'll be that rap all them white people playin'
The game, well, it's changin'
These radio stations controllin' them dollars 
And I'm the scholar 
Hip-hop today ain't  and paid
Dr. Dre wouldn't get The Chronic played
And that's a shame 
Just some shit I gotta handle 
I give these bitches lil' somethin' they can dance to 
I ain't gon' be a show that gets cancelled
You ain't like what's on, change the motherfuckin' channel
My hip-hop peoples, I feel ya pain
But it ain't no reason to just sit and complain 
On a track, sayin' "Fuck rap, all of it's wack"
'Cause cream muhfuckers said, "It's all for the cash" 
So for ya single, sing a lil' jingle
Then you can stack chips like Pringles 
It ain't hard, it's easy, it's magic
Dance, do a backflip, make some cool ad-libs 
Once you see that check that you like, say "Fuck it"
And go back to blessin' the mics
It's hip-hop forever, but it's stressin' to fight
And money makes it easier to rest here at night
Hatin' on Soulja Boy? It shouldn't happen
Look at him laughin' , he know he ain't that good at rappin'
You can hate but it ain't gon' solve shit 
Hip-hop's the culture, it's gon' evolve quick
There's some music I don't bump and bang
But it is what it is, let 'em do they thang
Stop bitchin', stop bitchin', stop bitchin'
Stop bitchin', stop bitchin', stop bitchin'
Shit ain't gon' change, ain't nobody gon' listen
Y'all need to just stop bitchin' 
Uh
And a lot of cats sulk and won't fuck with this new shit 
But, ayo fam, music is music 
Y'all need to stop bitchin', give this shit a listen 
Some of these cats is actually spittin' 
There's a lot of wack cats in the game
But it ain't no reason to hate on they name
Worry 'bout yourself, let 'em do what they do 
Soon it's out with the old and in with the new
Most cats is only hot for six months 
But real hip-hip is gon' be around forever 
What sell is gon' change every day, it's basically the same as the weather 
And big ups to everybody who spit it from the heart 
You do it for the real and you live for the art 
Sayin', "Hip-hop's dead" is gettin' played out
Everybody just lookin' on how to get they name out
Some shit to dance with? That's what's up too
But it ain't it the same shit you smokin' blunts to
Fuck bein' famous, who cares if you make it
Just make the music that you love and stop hatin'
Stop bitchin', stop bitchin', stop bitchin'
Stop bitchin', stop bitchin', stop bitchin'
Shit ain't gon' change, ain't nobody gon' listen
Y'all need to just stop bitchin' 
UhAy yo Josh

Yeah I got shit to drop mother fucker
I always got shit to drop damn
Ight you’ll meet me there?
I woke up scratched my nuts
Rolled a swisher on the shitter
Got blowed then I light me up a cigarette
The coolest flow coolio a movie roll
Now I’m tryna head up to the lab
I headed to the studio open the door
Say wassup to everybody who was posted before
I’m bout to record, they know I’m smokin’ of course
Blow some haze in the air, pull out my notebook
Then I head up to the booth, load the beat off my email
Phone on silent, ignorin’ calls from females
My man Josh sit down, get the tempo
Put on my headphones
Ight, let’s go
I let go intro of the beats startin’
Say a couple words try not to be retarded, huh
Cuz I'm a goofy dude doin' what I choose to do
Eatin’ tracks up like some snacks call me scooby doo
Now the beat about to drop verse 1
Its like a war when the soldier pull the first gun
Everything’s blank it’s just me and the mic
I don’t read a lot, so I try and see what I write
Visualize the melody, hypnotize everybody watchin
I hope they ain’t blink they eyes
Cuz you don’t wanna miss a fuckin second
When I’m catchin wreck
I be in the booth goin’ off try to catch my breath
Couple more bars, couple seconds left
Killin’ em softly takin’ extra steps
They never guessed I be murderin’ and blessin’
Ight the first done but before we start the second
We gotta do mad shit
Doubles and adlibs
And Josh make it sound like magic
He a old school genius with the pro tools
Tryna school me on everything that the pros do
I tell him that he needs to think it in the book
But for now we makin guap just singin’ on some hooks
So I don’t worry bout the chorus
The track gotta hook on it
And my verses with that, they sound good on it
Now I do a second maybe do a third
If I’m in the mood to go crazy with my words
I take a lil’ break got some haze to burn
The cats sittin’ outside can wait they turn
We makin’ classics in the session
Mom’s askin me these questions
"When you comin' home? You got school."
Nah, I’m suspended
After this track done burn the last blunt smokin’ good
Payin’ for my time with stolen goods
Say peace to whoever, outside its dark
I’m blowed and can’t find where the fuck I parked
So I beep the car, oh there it is
Lets go ahead and dip, hop in the whip
Light a cigarette and sit
Gotta ride home ahead of us
Slumped in the back
Tell my man wit the whip to bump on my track
Tryna ride out, and I’m high nowWe get it poppin' on a late

Drop and go away?
Bring it right back
And I'ma fight that man in the tight slacks
He need an ice pack, he need his life back
All up in his grill like rat-a-tat-tat

With my brain in the clouds, so your girl can call back

2008 shit
Hahaha, we had to take it back
P Dub and Easy Mac, haha
Life changed since the old days, how it all used to be
The buffoonery, and dreams of buyin' jewelry
The class can't learn 'til a student teach
I gave a lecture, wrote a stupid speech
Back in the days, The Ill Spoken ridin' ATV's
Performin' on TV there at JPB
It was four years ago, seemed like so long
In the attic smokin', comin' up with dope songs
Never knew I'd be a star back then
I was tryin' to get money for a car back then
I just wanted to record back then
Never had a lot to do, we was bored back then
All them days at the Shadow Lounge, sellin' tickets, gettin' shows
We was tryna tell the world we was the next to blow
Even beef with some dudes up in Canada
Had a little battle, spit our bars in the camera
We stayed up late makin' mixtapes
That we gave out tryin' to get our name out
Doin' shows, no one knew us
They would boo us, knew that when we grew up
They'd be askin' for a verse I'm blowin' back Dutches
Still got love for my dudes on rap mullet
Man that grind was tough, we wasn't gettin' far
Still rolled up to shows with more cars than people in attendance
Most of the people, they were people we was friends with
The best shit but, it got expensive when we couldn't sell tickets
Wasn't doin' much but tryin' to be the illest
At your crib smokin' weed and raps
Grindin' hard, 'cause music, we believed in that
We had some differences, yes, but for real we've been blessed
You the homie, man, I wish you the best
Paid dues, we gon' make y'all feel this
Kiss lips and spit the real
I remember way, way back in the days
Every aspect is vivid 
Paid dues, we gon' make y'all feel this
Kiss lips and spit the real 
Drop flows that is hot fa'sho 
I never thought that we would make it up this far 
Life a times, that we recharge
Fresh out the weed jar, run that bih like a seesaw 
Been three years since we dropped a song
Got me thinkin' 'bout them days that we talkin' on
Stayin' up hella late 'til we passin' out
Just tryna face a 8th, Jimmy, pass the loud
At my mom's house, Point Breeze north south
Circle room smokin', yo, we blow the back porch out
Mac was still in high school while I was at the day job
Afterward, we lingered for, attracted to the stage, y'all
Most them cats hatin' too, face who wanna face off
Stories like "Ayy, sup"
Boy, I'll tear your face off
From a fantasy your gettin' on
We had the Talent and Drive, like we just can't go wrong
Can't forget our first video, from any raw
Quality was really raw
But them kids was really hard 
We made it catchy, like we blockin' Gretzky
Nowadays you couldn't miss me like the cost is risky
Dreams turn to business, business turn to paper
Turn the pages of the book and watch us turn to somethin' major
And always puttin' labor, even if they try to label us
With elements to change the game, call the labels up
And we was naive probably got soy loadin' up business for the quality
From freestylin' with Niels to watching you up on TV
Studyin' how it be though
You my mans, seen a real up and down the starter
Second hand give me unique perspective on it
And when you signed with Rostrum
Made me realize this shit was real and I ain't lost
No bridge that I ain't crossin'
And we some kings, I'm mom's Capricorn
'Til the castle gone, we Ill Spoken
Paid dues, we gon' make y'all feel this
Kiss lips and spit the real
I remember way,way back in the days
Every aspect is vivid 
Paid dues, we gon' make y'all feel this
Kiss lips and spit the real 
Drop flows that is hot fa'sho 
I never thought that we would make it up this farUh
Homie I remember everything
Every single blunt lit
Me and my homies we was all up on that dumb shit
Hittin' that one lick
Gettin' us dumb rich
Bein' extra sneaky not leavin' thumb prints
There was little Mac killin' packs of fun dip
And my people that been with us since the young kid
Gettin' caught by my pops blowin' haze... smokin' blunts from my younger through my older days
Nothin' goes to waste
Not a day was smashed
There was dough to make
And we was makin' cash
Bangin' rap till the neighbors called the cops
Beatin' dudes up throwin' mollywops
Some people say that I'm all just talk
But I'll tell you everything about the block I walked
I wasn't cookin' pies, I wasn't tokin' guns, but I was lookin' high, stayin' smokin' blunts
Yeah I stole a little bit boy nothin' was cheap
Santa stayed puttin' that coal under my tree
And this is peace to my people and peace to my enemies
But nothin' keeps me alive like my memories...
You make me feel alive, "These memories keep me alive"
You are my highest light, "These memories keepin' me high"
You make me feel alive, "These memories keep me alive"
You are my highest light, "These memories keepin' me high"
But let's get back to the good ones
We was just chasin' some women
Runnin' the game before we playin' an inning
Now we need that cake to the ceiling
Cook in the kitchen
But these, haters is grillin' fill the place up with villains
Cause we all just chillin' now
Got the illest crowed
Raisin' the roof, uh, breakin' the ceiling down
I'm iller now then when ya'll first heard me
Peace to the people who listened past the first week
And there's a lot of ya'll
So let me take a vow
This to memories
The drinks is on the house
We came a long damn way from sittin' on the couch
Peace to all my honies that was takin' off their blouse
You'll miss me when I'm out
Don't leave me when I'm gone
You hatin' fourty-year-olds I'm peein' on your lawn
I treat you like a jon
The way I treat a beat
This ain't everything, but I'll let you sneak a peakLet me look inside your funky mind
Let's take a ride to the place where love gets made
I need direction to your dimension
I— am not afraid to die
Cause Heaven got no gravity
I'ma float away, my spaceship make it out this galaxy
Have you seen the world beyond the boundaries?
I feel your love around me
I'm safe in outer space
And these vibrations will create a high
I was made to fly, on my way up
Let it ride, and away I'ma take ya
I'ma space traveler
I'm an outer space traveler
Just a lonely space traveler
I'm an outer space traveler
Will you let me lift the sins within your soul?
I fear I've lost control
The devil lives inside my home
Yeah, I lost my mind while tryin' to find forever
Tryin' to buy adventure
Feel the music set you free
I just want to live inside the ecstasy
Do you trust in your reflection?
Are you stuck in one direction?
Will you find your way to Heaven?
Yeah, before the world ends?
Yeah, before the world ends?
I'ma space traveler
Liquor say the magic word
I'm an outer space traveler
Just a lonely space traveler
I'm an outer space traveler
Yeah, he a space traveler
Off the liquor he a wizard, say the magic words
Outer space, Captain Kirk
Flow creatin' massacres
Gettin' back to work to feed the scavengers
That freaky shit, I keep a bitch who pussy smell like lavender
Yeah, every day a payday— peep the calendar
Yeah, the flow is mathematics, speakin' algebra
I'm a rare breed, don't nobody scare me
The shit again
It's Fisherman, LarryYeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Might not, feel your, face
You might not feel your face, but you always feel the high
And nothing last forever, said these, voices in my mind
Are we all just afraid, do they notice the change?
You see out the weather, still carry umbrellas
Always be scared of the rain
And I'm still terrified of ending the pain
We live with these beautiful colors
Don't notice the shades of gray
You start to feel strange, how it cooks your brain
You wander around for no reason, can't even remember your name
Oh, yeah
I need a little sweet, sweet amnesia
A sweet, sweet amnesia, yeah
I need a sweet amnesia, yeah
A little sweet amnesia, yeah
A sweet, sweet amnesia
A sweet, sweet amnesia
Oh, how I need ya
Yeah, amnesia, yeah
Marlboro Red in grandmother purse
Whatever help to speed up the hearse
We livin' in hell
Lead in the shells, they lead by example
People, they ask you shoot for the stars
But all that we seen is shootin' from cars
Is shootin' the norms, they shotgunnin' beer
Wet on your eyes, suppressin' the tears
Lies you told over years, aimed at the ones that you loved
Lookin' for Heaven above you, put on a front from hope that it's real
Still young and blinded by the street lights
Hate make it hard for you to sleep tight
Do we live and die to fuckin' ease by?
In the belly of the beast, still the meek thrive
Headin' out, we run from red dots
Seem the best bet is death at young age
Least then you get the front page
Then again the love is still fakeI try and be the man my pops see in me
Drivin' down this road they call Easy Street
Waitin' for the light to turn green
And life is all good when they sights is on me
Tonight they call me money-driven Mac
'Cause once I see them dollars, I ain't gon' give 'em back
At the edge of your seat, you need to just relax
This ain't the main course, I'm just givin' you a snack
But soon you'll be ready for a meal
But I ain't ready, so y'all can just chill
'Cause I know that I ain't ready for a deal yet
I ain't even get a chance to play the field yet
Just started, I need to break a real sweat
But I haven't spit somethin' they ain't feel yet
Well, hold up, everybody got some haters
They hatin' on the Steelers and in love with the Raiders
Angry at the top from the bottom
Try and pull ya leg, hopin' that you'll fall and break
But I ain't makin' that mistake
I had to do this beat when I heard my man Drake
For goodness sake, this shit just sets me in a trance
Some people wanna listen, and the rest just dance
That's cool with me 'cause I like to get my groove on
I'm comin' with some new songs, tryin' not to do wrong
But lately it's been kinda hard
'Cause money on my mind
And the only time I'm stuck behind the bar
Is when I'm thinkin' of the next line to rhyme
But this shit, I ain't even have to think about
Picked up the pen and the ink started spillin' out
I'm so high, I believe that I can feel the clouds
So I hope y'all feel me now
The way these haters grillin', it kinda tickles
'Cause they think that they got me in a pickle
But in reality, I'm chess moves ahead of 'em
And I ain't sick of people comparin' me to Eminem
Funny to me, the more money I see
The more places to go, different countries to see
I'm just turnin' up the heat to a hundred degrees
Spittin' like I got a razor blade under my teethYeah, some people say that we just crazy
We don't know shit, we just lazy
Livin' in, the world is changin'
Simple things, yeah, the love we makin'
And I could change the way I feel
I could swear to God that it ain't for real
I could close my eyes, I could disappear
But before I die, better start livin', yeah
We could head down to the river
I hope the water don't dry
It's too warm to be winter
You too yours to be mine
And this storm is a killer
It'll keep you inside
It'll take everything that it give ya
If you don't take your time
You be where the waves end, woah
Where the days ends, oh, oh
Said, I couldn't change brand new faces
Everyday will be your , your favorite
I might be unchangin'
Alright, I gotta take a pissYeah
To be honest lately I ain't been workin' 
I've been laying 'round like your everyday person 
Homie, I've been chillin' 
Tryin' stay grounded 
Made too much money, ain't got no time to count it 
Yeah, and I ain't here to cry about my problems
I ain't here to act like I don't got options 
Is life really that bad?
Is life really that bad?
Is your life really that bad?
Stop complainin'
Is your life really that bad?
Yeah, everyday we survive, mane
Is your life really that bad? 
Keep waiting, let them never stop hatin' on ya
If it is lemme know 
Gotta get up off your ass
Everybody gotta go
Yeah, the infinite bullshit, it doesn't end 
I'm amongst my friends, swagger on a hundred-ten 
It's feeling like, fallin' in love again
I made that money, money— musta learned somethin' then 
Not really, no— I don't give a fuck again
Bottom of the ninth inning, bring the closer from the pen 
Pittsburgh soldier, see the war's never over
Wake 'em up like Folgers, thought I motherfuckin' told ya
I'm the faces on the poster in your sister's room
While she doing homework probably sniffin' glue
Reason that she missin' school
Parents disapprove of the lyrical content
Wish I focused I more on the issues, less material objects 
My spiritual conscious is delirious often
Went from always livin' life to disappeared in a coffin
I'm a vampire, zombie child
All the walls fallin' down
Didn't pay attention to me, you don't have an option now
Karma brought the commas round
Line em up and knock em down
Bitch, I've been the hottest out
I became a monster
Now I whistle they shoot missiles that could bring a helicopter down
In way over my head, I'm tryin' not to drown 
Married to the game but made her cop the gown
Put it on, she dropped it down
Fucked the shit up doggy style 
I let it go though, that's a lot for now
Okay
To be honest lately I ain't been workin' 
I've been laying 'round like your everyday person 
Homie, I've been chillin' 
Tryin' stay grounded 
Made too much money, ain't got no time to count it 
Yeah, and I ain't here to cry about my problems
I ain't here to act like I don't got options 
Is life really that bad?
Is life really that bad?
Is your life really that bad?
Stop complainin'
Is your life really that bad?
Yeah, everyday we survive, mane
Is your life really that bad?
Keep waiting, let them never stop hatin' on ya
If it is lemme know 
Gotta get up off your ass
Everybody gotta go
Yeah, the flow is timeless
I don't got time for all these sensitive vaginas
Either catch up or get behind it
The highest climate hot, probably melt your finest diamonds
Everybody got something to say, just get in line with Simon
You call your momma tell her ain't done droppin' bombs
Finished shit with Donald Trump, probably down to call Ivana
Man, I'm the man, bet you wanna
Now I see a shrink cause even kings, they need a doctor
When they sick wit it, ride wit a pimp, bitch, I'm Xzibit 
Dimwitted, old Jewish spit kidders still ain't finished, paint drippin'
Nah, I ain't God, but I came with him, pain in 'em
Homie, I was blind before I gained vision 
Went from hell to heaven, shit, I changed prisons
Motherfuckers whinin' like Jerry when Elaine trippin'
Shit, it's the Pennsylvania friendly neighbor
Bars gettin' served like a tennis player
Order an extra waiter wit' it
Never let the pressure break you wit' it
Oh, life, what a monster that it makes you wit' it
God, this a cause for celebration
I know heaven's waitin' but this music shit is elevation
To be honest lately I ain't been workin' 
I've been laying 'round like your everyday person 
Homie, I've been chillin' 
Tryin' stay grounded
Made too much money, ain't got no time to count it 
Yeah, and I ain't here to cry about my problems
I ain't here to act like I don't got options 
Is life really that bad? 
Is life really that bad?
Is your life really that bad? 
Stop complainin'
Is your life really that bad?
Yeah, everyday we survive, mane
Is your life really that bad?
Keep waiting, let them never stop hatin' on ya
If it is lemme know
Gotta get up off your ass
Everybody gotta go
Whoo!
Good mornin'
No prob!
Yeah, that's all I got for now
Takin' notes, jot it down
Cause the paper longer than the Gotti trial
Take it all, leave it dryer than a water droughtYeah
Well God damn baby
Yeah, okay
Down down sugar love, nothing ever good enough
You be out there with your friends, tell you keep that pussy tucked
Lookin' up, never lookin' down to the danger
Take your hand, will you leave the club with a stranger?
All I make is bangers and they pay the bills right
Ask you how you feelin', you just tell me that you feel right 
Is this real life or is this fantasy, love you like my family
Can it be, will it be, poems and soliloquies
You be chasin' mystery, while I be makin' history
Will you be Mrs. me, when I leave you missin' me
Distance make the heart grow fonder, I long for, her
And everything that she does, we love
My soul was dirty, got it cleaned up
Only the best for you, never the cheap stuff
Gotta leave ya, see ya when I see ya
Downtown lookin' for my baby, every time she leave
It make my heart go crazy my love, make my heart go crazy my love 
And do you get a little lonely , want to see inside
Is there something you can show me? 
Yeah, make my heart go crazy my love yeah 
My love is like my drug , my love is like my drug yeah 
My love is like my drug, can't get enough of, yeah 
My love is like my drug , my love is like my drug yeah 
My love is like my drug, can't get enough of 
Yeah, yeah
Sweeter than cinnamon she sizzlin' hot
I may be trippin', I just figured I would give it a shot
Perfect of synonym, picturin' her image inside my thoughts
Wanna kick it with you, this the only life that we got
I hit your spot, lick your body then wax it Mr. Miyagi
Need a taste of you every single mornin', girl you my coffee
And I drink you up, stay in bed all day no point in gettin' up
Swear I can't get enough
Girl you so different, brilliant, you one in a billion
Make everythin' simple in this crazy world innocent
There somethin' bout you so dangerous
You try to make it through this tainted blood
Feel like it's made for us
Do you fantasize a feelin' so strong
That when it slip into your finger tips, you try to hold on
For your life, I've been wrong I've been right
But when I saw you tonight, you made me reconsider all that I know to be true
I need you back, I get that pussy wetter than a stream or river
A little weed and liquor, expensive cuisine for dinner
I can change your life drastically and hold you down like gravity
But if you need me I'm
Downtown lookin' for my baby, every time she leave
It make my heart go crazy my love, make my heart go crazy my love 
And do you get a little lonely , want to see inside
Is there something you can show me? 
Yeah, make my heart go crazy my love yeah 
My love is like my drug , my love is like my drug yeah 
My love is like my drug, can't get enough of, yeah 
My love is like my drug , my love is like my drug yeah 
My love is like my drug, can't get enough of 
Yeah, my little genius
We just in a game of hide and seek love
Keep up, on the run, I'ma lead ya , I need ya 
You be Rome I'll be Ceasar, what do you dream of 
Girl you my pre-love, I be stuck, freeze up
Got me nervous, mumblin' my words tell me speak up
Burn this motherfucker down, it'll be fun, earnest
What you wanna learn, I can teach ya
Jesus, we drunk, she down for the threesome
She just, wanna go crazy while she be young
Yeah, and it never get old, give her the world shit
Anything goes Lyrics from Snippet:
Said I hit the blunt in the whip
Tryna stunt with a bitch in the front
And a fifth, I'ma sip 'til I'm sick and I'm drunk
I ain't givin' a fuck, yeah, I been in a funk
Now I live like a pimp and abandon stuff
A magician to tricks, make a bitch disappear like her boyfriend comin' to the game
Pay up like the first of the month
Take what I want, everybody needs some, yeah
This how it supposed to be
How a muhfucka supposed to be
And a god gonna shine...Ayo dipset in London, right up on the youtube
I don't know why it don't got two million two views
That's a great video, chilling in this city though
'bout to do a sold out show, like I'm Diddy though
But I'm not my first name Mac, and if you heard that
My first time in London, I came back
Cause this is freestyle off of the top
And when I rip it on the mic I said your jaw gonna drop
This some biggie, chilling here in this London city
Girls pretty, everything I never smoked ??
Only smoking on that haze you be smoking on that phase
I got bars for days, everybody amazed
Cause every way I'm spitting is crazy
Cats all be rapping on their ish but it doesn't even amaze me
I just saw Kanye and Jay-Z live in Watch The Throne
Gotta girl and I gotta bone
You got a phone, I got two though
Shout out to Future, I copped Pluto
That's a great album, all up on that track
And I flip it back with some gymnasticsEast End in this bitch, yo
It's Ghost, Villain, Mac, Vinny, yeah
Uh, uh
Feelin' like a scholar, gotta keep my grades up 
Hear the same stuff every day from these lame fucks 
This whole game rough, kick you while you down
And none of these motherfuckers gon' miss you when you out
I used to sit around the house, waitin' for some dollars
Now I'm out grindin', chasin' after dollars 
I ain't a star just wastin' all my dollars 
We here for life, y'all fade away tomorrow
Pause, roll the dice like a board game 
I'm sleepin' with your girl and I don't even know the whore's name
So magnificent, quick to spit to kill this shit
These bitches is illiterate and this is some deliverance
No Bubba Sparks, talkin' Karl Malone
Snakebite, I hinge my jaw and swallow you whole
On my own path, throwback, dope rap 
The room stops when me, Vinny, Vil or Ghost rap 
Y'all fragile, broke glass, comin' with no swag
I be countin' numbers, no math, failin' class
But I'm scholarly, rap properly
Knowledge speaks with the verbal trigonometry
Uh, real slick like I'm climbin' out the foxes hole
Keep your grades up, bitch, no honor roll 
]
 for profit
Skeletons be tryin' on the clothes in my closet 
Infrequently home,  the coffin
In a world full of deadbeats wonderin' where the stars shit 
Just pumpin' 808s, mob shit
We keep it heartless regardless of circumstance
 burnin' plants to stimulate my daydreams
Learn advance techniques of the speech
The way I say things, amazin'
Raisin' hell 
Infiltrate arenas with the 
Battle scars 
With O.J. gloves and  punches
I walk through the realness like niggas on crunches
Yo, fuck this, my hips are strong enough to let me hop on, I run shit
Flick of the switch, permis' to drop bombs, I'm dumb sick
 for fun and the shot'll make your chest burn

My opponent, as you might have already heard, is Mac Miller . Now... I know, he's the rapper, he gets all the ladies  and he's that popular guy, but do you really want somebody running your school that smokes that much marijuana? Is that safe for your environment here at school? I've been in the bathroom and seen him lighting those Dutch Masters in the stall and that is not cool. So vote for me and not for weed. Thank you.

It's only gettin' better from here, Q, hahaBefore I start and jump into this review I want to inform you that I wasn't a Mac Miller fan before this album dropped. Mac Miller while being one of the most successful indie hip hop artists ever, lyrically he just didn't do it for me. He just kind of reminded me of everything I wasn't really feeling about mainstream hip hop these days. Then about a month or so before the release of his sophomore effort “Watching Movies With the Sound Off” he released a couple joints before that. My ears didn't really perk up to listen until I heard “The End Is Near” first because Ab-Soul is on it, second Mac produced the joint and thirdly lyrically Mac Miller had stepped his game up. I wasn't entirely sold but I was intrigued. Next day the video for “S.D.S” came out produced by FlyLo. Mac Miller once again came correct. Lastly I saw the tracklisting and guest features on this album and I knew I had to cop it. Let's see if “WMWTSO” was enough to transform me into a fan
As I stated before I wasn't too keen on Mac Miller's catalog before this, however once this album starts it immediately grabbed my attention from the beat and the dark lyrics. “The Star Room” is the first track on the album and it's filled with a Mac reflecting on his life and how it's changing. His new found success isn't all glory, glamour and fun times and it's evident this is causing him frustration. Everything from love, to drugs is covered in this song and it's a breathe of fresh air to hear from him
A couple tracks later we get “I Am Not Real” which features Earl Sweatshirt  but the darkness continues on this joint. Like in “The Star Room” Mac Miller talks about more specifically about the all the bad sides about the fame that he's garnered over the years. Gold diggers, fake friends considered acquaintances, pain, drugs and more. Hearing Mac take us into the other not so glamorous side of the music business. Mac is searching for answers to a lot of questions in this album in general and he's bringing us along for his journey through life
“I Am Who I Am ” has Mac Miller questioning being famous but this also questioning God and religion. He feels like God has blessed by becoming famous however at the same time he wonders why God gave it to him if he's sinning. He questions those who judge him for buying material things with the money that he's making now. He feels that he almost wasting away in the studio because he spends so much time in there. The second verse takes an even darker turn with the content
Forfeit in the war, he lays a sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate
Dealing with death like you work in the morgue aborsving the souls
Forgotten, he lost his way
Starring down that barrel, thinking not today
Now I'll be honest the middle of the album kind of falls off a little bit for me because he seemingly goes back to the old Mac Miller that I wasn't a fan off. With songs like “Red Dot Music” , “Gees”  and “Watching Movies” old fans of Mac will be pleased to see that he is in original form here and I think that's a good thing for fans to see. There's definitely maturity on this album but he sticks to his roots too
“REMember” is one of my favorite songs on the record where Mac Miller is paying homage to a fallen friend. The first verse has him talking to his friend wishing he would come back. A strong line has Mac wishing his friend had a kid so Mac could tell him/her stories about their would be father. The second first has Mac Miller telling people not to take life for granted because it can be taken from you at any moment so cherish it
The questioning of all of life's most difficult questions continues with “Aquarium”. The first verse mostly is about religion and his wanting to search for a deeper purpose in his life than what he's managing now:
"I'll always wonder what happened 3000 years ago
I like to toy with the idea that we really know
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?
In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings”
The second verse is the continued questioning on life's purpose and even brings the idea that in America it almost seems like our purpose is to make money and gaining knowledge. Throughout the entire record we're witnessing a 21 year old man question the world around him from everything he's given, to everything he's earned over the years
“WMWTSO” is easily Mac Miller's best effort. One part that I skipped on the album was its production which was extremely solid. One part that I see being overlooked is how well Larry Fisherman's  beats were on this album. This album shows that he's really put in the work on the production side of his game. Even as a whole the guest producers on the album were solid and created a cohesive sounding album . Lyrically Mac Miller puts everything on the line, he's questioning a lot of things and dealing with a lot of pain too
For fans of Mac Miller you might not like the change his underwent as of late, but assuming that you're fans of anyone that's featured on the project you should enjoy what Mac Miller is offering with “WMWTSO”. All the features are on point and the diversity on this project whether it be production or lyrics is good to hear from him. I am officially a Mac Miller fan, “Born Sinner” and “Yeezus” may have come out on the same day but don't sleep on this album. What ever box you had Mac Miller in before this release I can guarantee you that he breaks that box wide open during this entire albumI witness highs, I win the low 
One thing you know, I got the glow 
Can't trap the mind, now nigga, you know 
Oh, that's your ho, but yeah, she mine, yeah 
Oh yeah, she mine, yeah 
Oh yeah, she mine, yeah 
Oh yeah, she mine, yeah 
Oh Lord, please don't talk about my penmanship
We can talk about all the things that I did this year
I'm a wrestler, might hit you with the finisher
Tried to take my style, take it back, give it here
Little nigga, don't you ever try to tell me I ain't ready
Did you see my damn wrist? This stone R. Kelly
And a bad bitch here, put the dick up in her belly
And I'm walkin' round town, grill on like I'm Nelly 
Oh yeah, I can make it come down like confetti
No sense in gettin' mad 'cause you peanut butter jealous
Put a ho on a flight, I'ma send her straight to Dallas
If she disrespect me, I'ma cut her like a mullet, ayy 
Remember, got a crown and it's all day 
And we run the town, what ya gon' say? 
Car lookin' butter, yeah, that's part cake 
Pull up in this butter, yeah, that's parkin'
I witness highs, I win the low 
One thing you know, I got the glow 
Can't trap the mind, now nigga, you know 
Oh, that's your ho, but yeah, she mine, yeah 
Oh yeah, she mine, yeah 
Oh yeah, she mine, yeah 
Oh yeah, she mine, yeah 
Yeah
Hear the flow takin' off like all her clothes before we fuck
Eyes have opened up like Folgers caps
I woke up, found the dope and rolled a blunt
Ain't sober much, I'm stoned as fuck
Smokin' drugs so blunted, the flow cold-blooded
But I know what it's like, broke, no money
No hundreds, no twenties, low budget, so hungry
You don't wanna be a nobody
Okay, most of the time, my head is close to the line
Of blowin' up, like shakin' up soda
Fall into a coma on the sofa
Rise from the sun, throw up and roll okra
Yessir, when the goin' get tough, guess what?
You fold up like yoga, well, you know, uh
Boss, you know that don't ya? Yoda
Work on the road, you drove a Toyota Corolla
And you stay below the, speed limit, yeah
Geniuses
They wanna be the shit
 go there
Woke up, return flow the
Slow up, why don't you
Lay low, stay close to the ground, king cobra
Boa constricted, restrictions
Tryin' to get quicker with decisions
Why do I need to get lifted?
I'm too unstable, keep your distance, yeah
Yeah, they say, "Why don't ya grow up, what's the hold up?
We know you're faded
Show up late with no idea what the fuck you're doin' here" 
"Do you have a license to drive that vessel?" 
"Do you have the paperwork to drive that vessel?" 
"Yeah, you walk around like you're clueless
Your head is in the clouds, you actin' stupid"
I got nothin' to do with this bullshit
Yeah, okay
You drivin' slower
You smell the weed smoke aroma when I'm comin' over
It's fuckin' seven in the mornin'
Time to go the fuck home and
Go to sleep, maybe make some foodSo a lot of time
We have fun and hit with this rap shit, right?
But sometimes we just be sittin' there
You just gotta write something that, that mean something to you
More than just havin' fun, you feel me?
So this is that
Aha, look, uh, yeah
Recently life hasn't seem complete
Tryna speak the truth on each and every beat
I ain't in the streets or strugglin' to eat
I'm just stuck in a battle with defeat
I gotta go to school, get a good education
That's just society's expectations
What do I do when I'm feelin' so down?
No more friends so I sit up in my house
Think about the cause, glory, and success
Momma just hopin' that I try my best
But she scared to let me fly from the nest
Wanna leave a legacy before I reach death
I got my whole, life ahead of me
To figure out my destiny
Accomplish something 'fore I rest in peace
The troubles that I reach seem to mess with me
Can't keep me up, can't rest, can't sleep
Breath go weak, heart go cold
Body feel numb, think I lost my soul
I don't know what the fuck I can do, right?
Tryna live life but attached to this mic
Light in the tunnel start to shine so bright
Wanna change the world with the rhymes I write
Uh, feelin' worthless, guzzlin' this gin
Wonder what's my purpose, something I pretend
I'm just in search for a brother or a friend
Growin' up well 'cause the color of my skin?
What can I say to that, I can't take it back
It's just the love that made me rap
Feelin' like a QB tryna take a snap
Start my life, just feel great, relax
'Cause happiness, you can't pay for that
Mind lost, lookin' for a place to crash
Now I'm back on my own, still rappin' these poems
And my eyes stay attached to the phone
But she ain't callin', she forgot
Some irony been added to the plot
They told me not to love, but I ain't listen
So now I'm missin' her and dissin' other women
My best friends is some 40s and Ls
I keep forgetting all these little-bitty stories to tell
They think 'cause I rhyme I'm like the other kind
Trapped in the times, don't even got a mind
But I'm so blind and so wise
We grind to climb, please rise
And pay respect to the dead
Go 'head let 'em rest in they bed
We still gotta live, 'cause that's life
It just don't feel right
You know what I'm sayin'?
One take that, just come in the booth
And just speak, you know what I'm sayin'?
A'ight, Mac MillerThank you everybody for coming out
Listenin' to that Easy Mac
Shits for Pittsburgh, that 412
So light up your blunts
We got time for one more
Aight? Yeah
You at the back of the Mac
Yo, yo Easy Mac rap slick and sensational
Foolin' fools out they shoes like the first of April
I'm aimin' low, the words guaranteed to make em fold
I'll be remembered next December but your name'll go
My name remains, rhymes sent to your brain
Intentions disdained, these other cats resent and complain
My minds bettin' insane until the lyrics are complete
Spittin' fear in the ears of all those who compete
So I never skip a beat, the kid is Swisher Sweet
You can picture me cheesin' when my album hits the street
With the words too sick to speak, so I spit it in my sleep, fuck
Countin' sheep, I'm about to heat
Proving anybody wrong who was doubtin' me
They say, "Malcolm, please, get a new career"
It appears that they fear who I'll be in a year
Cause I'm creatin' racket, making tracks up in the attic
See my life changed after I heard Illmatic
It was drastic, automatic rappin' fantastic
I'm Jurassic, mic melts like plastic
I got the gift and you wish that you had it
So you study hip-hop and you read how to-do's
Thinkin' that it's helping but you learnin' how to lose
See I was— born gifted, live to get lifted
If rappin' ain't my life then what is it?
Yeah, yo, yeah, yeah
Rhymes is my domes home, on a gold throne
Spittin' sick, burnin' holes in the o-zone
I rock clothes that don't fit me, flows that spit quickly
And rip cities, kickin' clouds that hit middies
Cause the Pitt's busy, I'm sorry— you just missed me
I can't bare what you spit cause its grizzly
I kick shit you can't spit, wit, nitwit, sick quick
And let me twist back my Pitt fit
The best yet, blessed to catch wreck
In fresh sweats with more words in less breaths
Your next guest with more swords for pressed pests
The rest sweat for wars and accept— 
I gotta passion for rappin'
I'm passin' up has-beens with passive reactions
You askin' for action? I'm clashin' up your atoms
Your ass'll get flattened, be askin' what happened
Yeah, look
I'm sleep deprived, but managin' to keep my mind
And when rest tries to find me, I seek to hide
Bleed from eyes, they been open for too long
My body needs sleep but these demons is too strong
My insomnia lets me spit a monologue
Stayin' up writing as the night is going on and on
Out my mind, I'm a maniac insane with rap
Raises, now my brain describes players playin' haters act
Traitors need to watch they back, cause I know just where they at
Scared of rap, be where I'm at
Lookin' and I'm starin' back'
Hatin' , say ya prayers
And that Pittsburgh is where I'm at
We true hip-hop, we the rarest cats
Yeah, it's Easy Mac
Mackin' ain't easy
Get at me, yo
Pittsburgh, where you at?
Stand upLet's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him ‘cause he started out here locally
Hopefully I'll be at the top soon
For now I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it
‘Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear them talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad

Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap
Verse two, verse two, here we go
And ma'fuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring a friend 
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly
But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Hands up, London
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
One more time

Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap
*Applause*I only got a couple bucks in my pocket, fuck
Spitting out these bars like it tastes bad, yuck
I'm way too much, just shrug like shucks
Every time a hater diss a homie I dont give a fuck
Hell yeah, its Most Dope bitch, just got it tatted on me
The only motherfuckers coming to the after party
No time to bullshit, no bad advice
Been getting buzzed, spitting crack tryina bag of tight
Cause, I'm trying to stay kinda low key
And all the OG's get the whole glory
Always pay hommage to the dudes who came before me
Harder from the top, cause I thought it was lonely
Never going back to the old me, so here's the new me
A lot of motherfuckers starring in this movie
Heard it's impossible to do me
Thumbs up bitch, everything groovy
Do you remember, when you was different from the man you are right now
Getting high in the car right now
I'm just trying to have a ball right now
Swear I want it all right now 
If it ain't stuck in your head I'll get the nail gun
Delivery like the dude you get your mail from
Happy shit how these bitches wave their tails
You can bet you haven't lived if you never even failed once
Taking over shit, call me pilgrim
And now we got fans who wanna film him
To be honest, it's a little too much to comprehend
Cause everywhere I go, they know they gotta let me in
Stay humble though, mama raised a gentleman
Told me be polite when you introduced to Benjamin
But now I'm spending them, acting like the president
Tryina shake the world, like I'm jumping round some gelatin
And they think they tempurpedic
I'm a get it though, best believe it
This is shit they sure to kept it secret
But fuck it, I'm a let you see it
Do you remember, when you was different from the man you are right now
Getting high in the car right now
I'm just trying to have a ball right now
Swear I want it all right now Uh, ignorant-ass white kid
But I'm still bicycling and recycling
And I'm still eating gummy bear vitamins
All my bitches taking Vicodin, huffing nitrogen
Hyper than Williams' middle son
Since I was a little one, moms had to put me on the Ritalin
Made a swisher run, crack the 40 then I lit a blunt
Told Chuck I had a couple raps, so we kicked the drums
All the best rappers are usually dead
But I'm the poison that left a widow Juliet
In the studio with candles lit and Buddha heads
Coming up with all the coldest shit, take your Sudafed
Contagious, speaking while sedated
God shit, make 'em want to add a couple pages to the Bible
I ain't got nothing left in my will
'Cept, "Throw it all in the casket, it's mine still"
Uh, I need some backpack cast raps
Took a break just to kill the game half-assed
Set some rat traps, went and took a cat nap
Woke up, threw the dead bodies in the trash bags
Act polite, but I'm nasty on the mic
Your bitch don't want my dick, then she has to be a dyke
Slap her but she like it, tell me, "Master, feed me pipe"
I'm a scotch on the rocks, you the Appletini type, it go:
Suck my dick before I slap you with it
I'm sorry, I said
S—suck my dick before I slap you with it
Wait, hold up, hold up, it goes, said
Uh, still fucking with these hoes, though
Bozo on these doppelgänger Jojos
Take a bitch to Soho for some Froyo
Tell her she gon' blow it, that's Romo
And now I'm out in Cali like Tone-Lōc
Young boy, but I'm chilling with some grown folk
Most Dope, Most Dope, you just blowin' smoke
How much coke you gotta sell to make a boat float?
Hit 'em, hit 'em 'til they tell me, "No more"
I'm a highly difficult ropes course
Pulling up to Rome on a chrome gold horse
Say "Wassup?" to the Pope, pull off in a Porsche
 who you kidding? Your flow's warshed
I ain't from the street but I'll grill you from the porch
I been had hoes, I played sports
Her ass out the bottom of her shorts, say
Suck my dick before I slap you with it
I'm sorry, I said
S—suck my dick before I slap you with it
Woo
Suck my dick before I slap you with it
Suck my dick before I slap you with it

Love reckless abandon verbal murder at random

Verse 3: D. Wreck
Chillin’ in the basement
Sippin’ on the Pabst
Smokin’ on blunts until my body adapts
And underneath the floorboard
We got a pot of sax
Call me a poet because I got a lot of snaps
Whenever I’m done the whole premise claps
There’s an enemy at my back
And my nemesis slacks
If you know steel city
Then you don’t need the map
Cause we roll up in big packs like thumbtacks
Then pop off the caps and party with ya boy
And if you got beef, I got the tender loin
Throw me a pound
And then I will roll it in a joint
And then I’ll call up heads, and flip it like a coin
Hit you in your groin and then I’ll grapple the crop
But if you want some revenge
Ya ass will get socked
If you want to go to heaven, and float to the top
We don’t leave no fuckin' trace
We clean up like a mop, peace!

I’m sorry didn’t see you there , I’m sorry didn’t see you there , I’m sorry didn’t see you there 
Me and my crew drinking on some booze
Smoking on some squares
I’m sorry didn’t see you there , I’m sorry didn’t see you there , I’m sorry didn’t see you there
Verse 4: Easy Mac
I’m sorry I didn’t see ya
You must’ve been invisible
Just got thrown out of class by the principle
Callin’ me pitiful
Givin’ me some ridicule
I’m sorry that I’m really not into school
The little dude belittles you
Spittin’ stories and riddles too
MC’s tempt me and then Ima come and shit on you
Spit on you
My crew hot not lukewarm
We do 
 unicorns with two horns
Rollin’ parties with suits on
We classy
Don’t put it past me
Got a question? Ask me
Pussy rookie rappers I be lookin’ after
Easy Mac, it’s me, you gettin papers stackin’ chapters
Passin’ caps like race cars with eight bars
And kick 8 more will tear ya face off
Cops chase cars
The best may fall
You in the wrong game
Enjoy playin’ baseball
Chorus: Easy Mac
Me and my crew drinking on some booze

Aight man, I'ma try this one out
Got my chick makin' drinks with that cream
While I'm takin' sips of that lean 
Life ain't a bitch, well, if you make a wish
You might break a record like me 
Got a mil' at the age of nineteen
But I may just give that back 
To show my friends I could do it again
If I started all from scratch, huh
All I do is rap 
You could run and tell them hoes that 
More pipe than a plumber, I might get her number
You like her, I love her, that's that
This rap shit what I do , get hyphy if you can 
Pharrell just hit me up, said this might just be the jam 
She get good grades, suck good dick
What more could you ask for?
Big ol' butt, love to fuck
What more could you ask for?
Fuck with drugs, fall in love
What more could you ask for?
What more could you ask—
W-W-What more could you ask—
Go a hundred miles an hour , ride around the city 
Smokin' on that sour, couple bad ones with me
Twenty grand in my jeans , thirty grand on my neck 
You heard around by word of mouth that I get these hoes all wet 
I just put out my album , about to throw it on cassette
Sell another hundred thousand, then buy my pops a Corvette
Never claim no sets , and I never start no beef 
But I promise I know some crazy people if you fuck around with me 
She get good grades, suck good dick
What more could you ask for?
Big ol' butt, love to fuck
What more could you ask for?
Fuck with drugs, fall in love
What more could you ask for?
What more could you ask—
W-W-What more could you ask—
I'm switchin' up my flows 
Sellin' out these shows 
Pop a bottle of Dom P, then cop my moms a Merlot 
Now I'm actin' so grown 
Made a business all on my own 
These labels callin' my phone
But I made this bidness all on my own 
I'm knockin' out your speakers 
Knock you out your sneakers 
I'm in the game, I'm on the field
You watchin' from the bleachers 
Win the Heisman, I'm MVP
Dan Marino, you Sandusky
I'm MC Hammer, you can't touch me 
Skateboard P, he be on that beat 
She get good grades, suck good dick

S—somebody do somethin', please
Can somebody do somethin', please?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody do somethin', please
Can somebody do somethin', please?
Whoa—oh—oh—oh
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, yeah, I said
Uh, I close my eyes before I cross the street
If a car about to hit me, then he oughta beep
Watching Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep
It's harder than it seems, I'm underwater in my dreams
Said, I'm in awe, this jigsaw puzzle's not complete
I'm just an idea, nothing con-cer-ete
I came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines
They tryna change with us, but come to the same difference
So shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
I don't mind those hating on my style
I tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low
Said, I'm no God
I don't think that I'm a human, though, 'cause I'm so odd
If people selling drugs, they can't find no job
Wonder if Christ made a million off selling the cross
Okay, let bygones be bygones, my mind strong as pythons
The day that I die on will turn me to an icon
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on
The best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan
Somebody do somethin'
Said, somebody do somethin', somebody, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody do somethin', please
Said, somebody do somethin', somebody, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody, ayy
I'm sippin' Jameson like I was majored in whiskey flavourin'
When I'm drunk, I'll cut your head off, leave it danglin'
FlyLo's still tryna put me onto Ableton
Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me, said
I ain't nobody, and neither are you
Been contemplating if I even still believe in the truth, I'm so stubborn
I'd rather write my own history book
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
Hell nah, all your songs are 16's and a hook
We here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution
Dyin' for the movement, tryin' not to lose it
Jewish Buddhist consuming the views of Christianity
I wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in a igloo
I hear the fish bitin' nice right now
I can't figure out life and feel right right now
Boo, if I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it down
Spit the shit that leave a diaper brown
Can somebody do somethin', please?
Can somebody do somethin', please? Somebody, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody do somethin', please
Said, somebody do somethin'
Somebody, yeah, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody do somethin'
Wassup London?

YeahOhh—ohh—ohh—ohh—ohh
Ohh—ohh—ohh
Yeah
Ohh—ohh—ohh—ohh—ohh
Ohh—ohh
Yeah
I came for whoever is in charge 
Suggest you go and get yourself a weapon and a guard 
They need some coffee, everybody sleeping on me
Going around door-to-door, setting off alarms 
All that horse shit, you should have left it at the barn
Keep a stallion, tell her gallop to the store and get cigars, yeah
Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made 
I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase
Me and my bizarre ways 
I moved up from a Private to a Sergeant, you can see it from the scarface
Hidden in a dark place, swimming in a shark tank
Give a bitch a little bit of change, she a game in an arcade
 Not a second to lose
I’m the motherfuckin' Bible, that’s forever the truth 
And this is not another case of the celebrity blues
I shot the sheriff and the deputy, too
Murder, murder, murder, murder, what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all 
Got what you need if you like breaking the law
My mother raised me a God 
Yeah
Blame the drugs, got me sinning on a weekday
Drunk as fuck, do a buck sixty on the freeway 
Giving y'all the freebase, hidden in the middle of a briefcase
That's hidden in a subwoofer, beat case
Used to wanna know how a freak taste
Now I’m in it in an instant like replay
Broad’s a baton, pass her off like relay
Why I’m so mad on my B-Day?, she say
“I thought you got sober,” then I said
“I wish you’d stop being a bitch and get to minding your business”
Told me “Money has changed ya”
I get to thinking, how rarely do I visit? How’d I get so egotistical?
I’m a Buffalo Soldier
Heaven is a mile away, the trouble, much closer
I’m only 23 but my mind is older, and it’ll forever be
Dead presidents to the homies, death to my enemies
Murder, murder, murder, murder, what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all
Got what you need if you like breaking the law
My mother raised me a God 
A goddess told me “good morning” when I woke up
You know I had a good morning when I woke up
Gotta thank God every morning that I woke up
Would you remember me if I never woke up?
Bye bye
I've been a sinner, I’m just tryna stay
Warm through the winter, and I’ll be on my way
I’m just a drifter, the weather speaks in whispers
I just need some shelter, give me shelter from the wind
Woo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system
412-9... *buttons dialed* is not available
“Hey man, I wish you were here, happy holidays
Um, I love ya. And I hope you have a good night/weekend/I hope I talk to you soon, alright, godspeed”
Oh yeah
I thought I’d have it figured out by now
Shit would be simple, problems would be in the past by now
Me and the homies would be sittin' on millions
Reminiscin' on times when we were so broke and livin' in Oakland just chillin'
I thought I’d have it in the bag by now
I thought that we’d be kickin' back by now
I know that life is a bitch
I know that life is a bitch, I thought we’d put her in a cab by now
But I’m stressin', I can’t relax
Swallowin' my pride and I’m hidin' what’s making me mad
Everybody saying I need rehab
'Cause I’m speedin' with a blindfold on and won’t be long
Until they watchin' me crash, and they don’t wanna see that
They don’t want me to OD and have to talk to my mother
Tell her they could have done more to help me
And she’d just be crying
Saying that she’d do anything to have me back
All the nights I’m losing sleep
It was all a dream, there was a time that I believed that
But white lines be numbin' them dark times
Them pills that I’m popping, I need to man up, admit it’s a problem
I need to wake up before one morning I don’t wake up
You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya
I’m too obsessed with goin' down as a great one
But if you wait too long they gon' find someone to replace ya
So I guess this is a letter
To all my brothers, Most Dope, that’s forever
I love you more than words could express
And this the part that Q start cryin', if he ain’t already yet
I did my best to be a leader you respect
At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret
So tell my baby I love her
And if she give me the chance I’ll put a seed inside her, make her a mother
Just know that there’s a place
Where all my people worry free and e'rybody straight
Every devil don’t got horns, every hero ain’t got capes
Opened up my eyes, shit, I’m finally awake, good morning
Yeah, good morningJust strollin' down the street, and I'm coolin'
Get somethin' good to eat, now I'm coolin'
Don't worry 'bout the money, I'm just goin' with the flow
Enjoyin' every single day 'cause life is dope, woah
Hey, hey, hey
New day, new city
Travel across the country, picked up like a kidney
Shit, we smokin' like a hippie
Feelin' trippy, gettin' jiggy, tryna boogie it down like it's the '60s
DJ, could you play my song?
What we would hear when we was spittin', always stayin' long
They sleepin' on me,  PJ's is on
Now the beat drop kinda how you break your bong
Days is long, but the nights is longer
Funny how  might be proper
Lemonade and ice tea, made an Arnold Palmer
Sittin' by the pool with some bitches playin' doctor
 skinny dippin', plenty women would be chillin'
Feelin' like I'm simple livin', cooler than the air condition room
So I peaced on a deuce: 
Spittin' exactly how I'm livin', hey
Just strollin' down the street, and I'm coolin'
Get somethin' good to eat, now I'm coolin'
Don't worry 'bout the money, I'm just goin' with the flow
Enjoyin' every single day 'cause life is dope, woah
Acid rains drops on a cocaine brain
Got a marijuana mind, talkin' dope boy swag
The boy doper than Kurt Cobain
People tryna act like they ain't heard my name before
 to the core
Tryna walk into the mall with money, cleanin' out the store
Used to be a scrub and now I'm gettin' all this love
Probably because these motherfuckers see I got it buzzed
 diss my song, you better put it on
And I stay with thumbs up like The Fonz
Ayy, cooler than the sun shade
Feelin' like a lazy motherfucker on a Sunday
One day, my money gon' be tall like Dikembe Mutombo
 bow to your sensei
Never follow what both my parents say
'Cause life is dope and we get paid, hey
Just strollin' down the street, and I'm coolin'
Get somethin' good to eat, now I'm coolin'
Don't worry 'bout the money, I'm just goin' with the flow
Enjoyin' every single day 'cause life is dope, woahToo fucked up to rap
Rollie on my wrist, a diamond ring right on my finger
They said, "Stick to rappin', boy, you ain't much of a singer"
But me, I don't give a fuck, 'cause simply I'm too cool
Got a whole life I can live, plus I just bought a pair of shoes
Funny, it's just magic, when my thoughts are so sporadic
And my mom thinks I'm an addict, or it's messy up in my attic
Got people in my ear, who's this speakin'? I don't hear
I'm too focused to be the dopest, got my mansion with chandeliers
They thinkin' they all know you, and it's easy to break you down
There's so much they can show you, here's the notes, just take 'em down
Everybody's watchin', so be sure to make 'em proud
You can say you pissed off, you just can't say it too loud
Bankin' on me, waitin' for me to fall
My homies first, no doubt about it at all
The world's got evils, they wanna watch you fail
But I'ma live to tell the tale
Oh well
Sometimes it's okay to stop and just say, "Fuck it all"
Fuck their expectations, I just need me a vacation
All these dumb public relations, swear I'm runnin' out of patience
There's no more shit I'll be takin', I'm just smilin' while you hatin'
Every cadence, every word, they analyze it and criticize it
"Someone else thought of that first," well, I'm just tryna redefine it
They're all so narrow-minded, tell 'em, "Open up that mind"
'Cause what I make is timeless, and right now that's so hard to find
They thinkin' they all know you, and it's easy to break you down
There's so much they can show you, here's the notes, just take 'em down
And everybody's watchin', so be sure to make 'em proud
You can say you pissed off, you just can't say it too loud
Bankin' on me, waitin' for me to fall
My homies first, no doubt about it at all
The world's got evils, they wanna watch you fail
But I'ma live to tell the tale
Oh wellOkay, I watch her sip the cyanide
Just like it's fine wine
She had her summer house in Malibu, it's high tide
Smokin' doobies, watchin' Sci-Fi movies
Make her fruit smoothies, wanna swim out to the buoys, but she terrified
Drownin' in the paradigm, singin' Sweet Sweet Caroline
The notes always been sharp though
Can you swim? No, uh, where the art go
I'm chilling with some gangsters at a horror show
A lot of pot smoke, watchin' Donnie Darko
I got a meeting schedule for tomorrow
I'll probably sleep through the alarm tone
And the song goes on
And the song goes on
And on and on and on and on
Rolling 'round and improvisin'
Girl your mind is hypnotizin'
Flyin', hypnotizin', so excitin', hyp-hypnotizin'
Rolling 'round and improvisin'
Girl your mind is hypnotizin'
So excitin', flyin'
Yeah
She still waitin' for the right one
But she never gonna meet him the night club
Clean her life up, put away the white drugs
All the dudes is all wifed up
It's a legend in the making
Modern day prophet, follow everything I'm sayin'
Never in a rush, I'm keepin' everybody waitin'
Couldn't help but laugh at the expression on their faces 
Okay, the flow so wicked, most prolific
Trust no bitches, mind your own business
I'm so lifted, I'm oh so lifted
I don't think I'm ever comin' down 
And the song goes on
And the song goes on
And on and on and on and on
Rolling 'round and improvisin'
Girl your mind is hypnotizin'
Flyin', hypnotizin', so excitin', hyp-hypnotizin'
Rolling 'round and improvisin'
Girl your mind is hypnotizin'
So excitin', flyin'She go skiin' in the summer
Maxin' out her credit card just to slow dance to the thunder
Her picnic's by the reservoir
And her dad's old beat up station wagon
Get in and drive away
She lived in fear, we disappear to our secret hidin' place, yeah
I thought I saw her smile this afternoon
By the water, lyin' naked
As the wind began to whisper her the truth
Hold on
Let go
She wakes up, wakes up
Opens up her eyes that covers up the lies
She hides behind her makeup
Give up, she wants to give up
It's all too heavy on her mind, gettin' high, too many lines
Completely numb
Fake a smile for this photograph
I'ma count to three, please smile for this photograph, girl
I just wanna hang a picture on the wall

Yeah, yeah
Please acknowledge me, fuck the dreams of equality
I oughta be a leader but ain’t nobody follow me
World wants to swallow me right into the dirt
But fuck that, I’d rather a clique put three in my shirt
I’m headed to heaven, crash landed in hell
My moms ain’t understand that she’s the 
She got me trapped like a cell so I put on some L
And lay back ASAP, I’ma yell my farewells
I excel from the other side of the world
Where the grass is greener and the shells carry pearls
And I’m here now, but one day I’ll be gone
Until then I smoke a big L and put it on
'Cause I just live my life like that
Instead of fightin' back I chill and write rap
'Cause I dream of the day where people pay to have my songs
You hate my style 'cause it’s ancient like Babylon
And when rap is gone, I’ll be too
You won’t see me anymore, but I’ll see you
And free you? Nah, I’ll think I’ll keep you a slave
'Cause your mind is in the dark like the back of the cave
And back in the day... well, I wasn’t here
Visine in my eyes, still nothing is clear
If hip-hop is dead, then I’m the resurrection
Represented by presidents, all same complexions
Presidents to represent me

'Cause I grew up like a man, you need to understand
That I know that everything I got was put up in my hand
Yeah, it’s my life, so you need to let me live it
"Kid's so privileged," "kid is so gifted"
You never liked my fitteds, call me The Mad Hatter
But I’m killing wack rappers, cats that rap

This sober life is not for us, it's all because I got's to bust
Like havin' sex with Playmates
She wanna have some lunch tomorrow, can't afford my day rate
No apologies, it's me, my money and astronomy
I wake up like this crazy life might kill me
I'm tryna to change the world, they busy tryna take a selfie
I'm so deep inside this hole
There's no one down enough to help me
Other than Hell, I be's the hottest
But I make it snow in August, don't proceed with caution
Loose cannon, Hulk shit, I'm Bruce Banner 
The way the music hit you like the room dancin'
Me and my dawgs, we hungry, must be a huge famine
Crib in the Hampton's, one right out in Malibu
Pays to be an artist, it all started on Penn Ave
Yeah, the volume up, the sound is drownin' you

I roll some weed and blow my mind away , yeah
Find the shit I'm tryna say, yeah

In the whip, I almost hydroplaned, yeah
I roll some weed and blow my mind away , yeah
I pray to God she help me find my way
Yeah, before I started, regarded as one of the hardest in the yard
No money from a job, I was distracted by these broads
She said, "You want that pussy? Then walk the plank," and
I dove into that ocean, I saw her naked in the Hall of Angels
Chasin' lion, tigers, caught a Bengal
Best finagle the bagel, ready, willin', and able
Fillin' ya cable with destructions, spontaneous combustion
Alien abductions, plus what the fucks in
Platinum plus rappers
Say "Hi" when you see me, won't be say nothing after
I'm a motherfuckin' bastard, uh
Master of disguise, word to the wise, don't fuck with me

I roll some weed and blow my mind away, yeah
I pray to God she help me find my way Well, some years went by, time move fast
Tryin' to remember where you find me at
When I was young, when I was young
It's such a beautiful world, I wanna see the whole thing
Goin' places, not a single person knows me
Glad I'm still young, I'm glad I'm still young
Uh, look, yeah
As I drive around the city that I live in
Lookin' all around me, I remember bein' children
Just havin' fun, we was some wild ones
With a three-mile-long smile on
As a kid causin' mischief, just monkey business
Stayin' up past midnight was such a privilege
I didn't have to worry 'bout shit
Fall and cut your knee, get the first aid kit
Had a crush on a girl, you wanna hold hands
Heard a slow jam, ask your girl to slow dance
Mom read me stories, thought I was Peter Pan
Pops did his thing, he taught me to be a man
Life went by fast, now I'm 'bout to be eighteen
Lookin' in the mirror, seein' what the world made me
And I'm satisfied, I think I'm doin' fine
Lookin' at the jungle gym I used to climb, I think
Well, some years went by, time move fast
Tryin' to remember where you find me at
When I was young, when I was young
It's such a beautiful world, I wanna see the whole thing
Goin' places, not a single person knows me
Glad I'm still young, I'm glad I'm still young
Uh
Then high school started, I'm rememberin' that
Walkin' round the halls, no clue where I was at
With my backpack, pants sagged, half mask
Crackin' jokes just tryin' to make the class laugh
I was and still am the kid that'll keep you smilin'
Little ladies man, girls never was a challenge
Never on the honor roll, too much chronic smoke
Am I in college? No, but to be honest though
I wouldn't have it any other way
I do it all the same if it was any other day
You gon' know when the time is good
'Cause ain't nothin' comin' close to your childhood
Well, some years went by, time move fast
Tryin' to remember where you find me at
When I was young, when I was young
It's such a beautiful world, I wanna see the whole thing
Goin' places, not a single person knows me
Glad I'm still young, I'm glad I'm still youngIntro:

Not duckin' and dive, tell em fuck it I'm walkin'

Progress no stress, whatever happen, happen

I got a job, a career, I'm the talk of the year
Look at myself in the fight of the mirror

Love will exist in forever
Forever nothin' without you
I can't tell you 'bout the weather
I fell asleep watchin' the news
Rain, always
The state of mind, flooded brain
Thoughts keep racin' by, jump and pray
Away we fly, day by day
Travel through space and time, save the day
Baby, you wastin' time, a-okay
Make up your crazy mind, fade away
Don't you fade away into an area of grey
 We are, we are everything but plain
 We are, we are shinin' in the shade
 I am Poseidon on the waves

Nothin' with her life, she go out every night
It's alright, alright, alright, she just takin' her time
She don't have a plan, on nights, she'd rather dance
Here, there, can't be everywhere at the same time
Better make up your mind, baby
Better make up your mind, today, you're alive
Stop wastin' your time and maybe
You're crazy, but hey, so am I
Yeah, well, she got a
Split personality, she wake up half asleep
Walk up to the mirror, ask herself if she gon' have something today
How easily she changed
She wear so many faces, but she wanna stay the same, yeah
And everybody think she playin' games
Yeah, that pretty smile hidin' all her pain
No one ever listen when she tryin' to explain
And it's probably the reason for how wild she became
Okay, now she just wanna be
Anywhere but here, anywhere but here
She believes people are free
Far away from here, far away from here
She doin'
Nothin' with her life, she go out every night
It's alright, alright, alright, she just takin' her time
She don't have a plan, on nights, she'd rather dance

Better make up your mind, baby
Better make up your mind, today, you're alive
Stop wastin' your time and maybe
You're crazy, but hey, so am I
I remember when I met you, you intimidated me
I tried to get your number, you said, "Only in your dreams"
Okay, so I thought about you when I go to sleep
You never notice me, you was way out of my league
Until you broke your crown, girl, you used to be a queen
What happens now? Life after royalty
No one ever listen when she tryin' to explain
And it's probably the reason for how wild she became
Okay, now she just wanna be
Anywhere but here, anywhere but here
She believes people are free
Far away from here, far away from here

Stop wastin' your time and maybe
You're crazy, but hey, so am I
Yeah, daddy
Oh yeah, right there
Oh my God!When I was just a little one , I did sit still once
My cousins used to call me Hit-N-Run
I learned a lot from my homies and a lot from my fam
All my, all my peoples really made me who I am
My grandma passed, I was savin' her a dance
I didn’t understand why I never got the chance 
But if there's anything she taught me, never give up
My enemies is waitin’ for a slip-up
So when I'm down, I get up 
Clock is tickin', it's either rap shit or it's  
I ain't got no, got no time to spare
Seats is fillin' up, better find a chair 
Used to  the rhymes for the finest pairs
And a lot comin' for me ’cause the grind is there 
Well, I just had a little piece of mind to share
Face-up on Times Square, it look fine there 
If you notice that I love it, then make way as I make somethin’ of it 
In due time , in this grind )
Near you , I'll be comin' soon 
In a theater near you, I’ll be comin' soon 
Aight, what?
There's a lot of speculation on my future as it is
Am I for real or just a can on the computer for the kids? 
Not a damn thing right now is buzzin' in the biz
In Pittsburgh, "Well, he nothin' next to Wiz"
I can dress 
Oh, that's Mac, only 'bout the facts
Rap gettin' littered on, I'm pickin' up the trash
And this track gettin' shitted on, spittin' out the ass
I got cool intentions , usin' weapons 
And you use a piece of shit I just stepped in 
I still do it for the city, do it for my block
A movie in your mind, I do it for hip-hop
If you notice that I love it, then make way as I make somethin' of it
In due time, in this grind )
Near you, I'll be comin' soon 
In a theater near you, I'll be comin' soon 
One time
The kid Mac, he be spittin' somethin' special
And I'm ready, hear the whistles from the kettle 
Shootin' missiles out my pencil with my pedal to the metal 
Startin' every day with a bowl of Fruity Pebbles
 Things are never gon' change 
Words released out this little thing I call my brain 
And you're all insane thinkin' I'm in class, 'cause I'm hatin' school
Breakin' rules, haven't been to school in a day or two
 'Cause it's killin' me to study
It really isn't funny, seemin' sillier than putty 
 while I'm supposed to be in class 
I pass grass to get a laugh, supposed to be in math
I'm an abstract, class-act cat with my hat back
Bitches holdin' onto blunts, better pass that
Gettin' high, findin' anything to laugh at 
'Cause we gon' take it to the top
If you notice that I love it, then make way as I make somethin' of it
In due time, in this grind )
Near you, I'll be comin' soon
In a theater near you, I'll be comin' soonWell, who is he?
I be the meanest, putting Jesus' pieces on a fetus
The Lord taketh and he keepeth, one of many masterpieces
I'm, rolling up the weed, and feasting on gorditas
Your bitch a junkie, always sucking on somebodies penis
Ooo, I'm eatin' generals, so it's chicken off the fine china
I put my dick inside your bitch and say the our father
Young Moses, part Wahlberg
Head Wrapped, car bomber
Death trap, dark slider
Jump, I motherfucking got ya, once I dropped ya
Who's hot?
I moonwalk the Jungle GYM
Do not try to stop, cause you not gon' fuck with him
I'm rumblin' with countrymen
Do it for the USA
First you get the money, then the fame, then you get paid
Allayboomyay!
Come with superhuman strength
All this for the music's sake
But I'm getting stupid paid
Get ahead or lose a leg
Never did the funeral fake
To be great, you await
Everybody lets eat cake!
And ya don't and ya don't and ya don't stop
Uh, I'm sipping liquor 'til my liver pop
And playing tennis with cinder blocks
I'm in the spot
Chillin' with some nympho thots
Landed on the Planet Rock
Man to God, Hammerhead Shark in human camouflage
God damn, I'm on
Understand the plan is strong
Lead singer, came with Keith Richards, brought the band along
I'm pretty zen, lady
Head spinning, it's 1080
They say that I went crazy, but love me when the check clear
Red beard
See into the future, fear the end near
Bitch, I want it all, I will not give you not a cent here
This is not pretend, I'm trynna pay some pricey rent here
It's no words
Send in Goldberg and you gon' get speared
Do the most, I'm the host, and the special guest here
It's a fucking party started, everybody get weird
Take your pants off, move your body, you can dance around
I got you shitting in your pants, you wearing pampers now
Mean flow, hittin' free throws
Shoot em' granny style
Came a long way from rocking hand-me-downs
Err-Err, Fresh
I said the world is just a big gazebo
So, baby, let's get married in it
Well, mornin' Mr. McCormick
Mister should have been aborted
Mister Mighty Morphing sperm
Might absorb this Nike fortune
Money makes me feel important, like some type of vital organ
Rich people give poor advice, never could afford it
Walk into the jewelry store
Spendin' all my money
What did I do this for?
Pussy on my mustache
Never clean it up cause I'm a dumbassI know what she want, I know what she like
I know what she want, I know what she like, yeah
I know what she want, I know what she like
I know what she want, I know what she like
Yeah
Well, it's that long night, raw white
Shit that keep your jaw tight
Godlike, not Christ but always keep the sauce right
Top flight, all ice, give these bitches frostbite
I’m goin', they be holdin' on longer than a dog bite
I’m born light
Nausea with some pretty little blonde dykes
Tried to keep my hands clean and my socks white
Mob life, do your job right, keep your squad tight
And we can ball, live a long life, shit, it's alright
The whiskey on ice never made my wrongs right
But in a bar fight, I hit 'em with the hard right
I roll the dice, play my cards right
Ain't a movie star, but I'm sparrin' with the Dark Knight
I'm too far, gettin' yards like Favre might
Higher than a Mars flight when this cigar light up like the star bright
I work hard, so the car nice
You doin’ right, it’s all mine when the card swipes
Oh, you special, anybody ever told you? 
Ooh, you so special, has anybody ever told you? 
Do they know you so special? 
You so special 
You so special 
You so special 
Yeah 
I know what she want, I know what she like
I know what she want, I know what she like, yeah, yeah
I know what she want, I know what she like
Yeah
Well, I was born with a bored mind, chip on my shoulder
A sword and a war cry, I've been a soldier
Fight the horns for the Lord’s side
Before five I was fresh out the store fly, with a bitch courtside
Tint the windows by the doors, let the four ride
Speakers knockin', they can hear me in the north side
And I keeps the liquor pourin' 'til the storm dry
The haters said I wouldn’t make it 'til the pork fly
These days, got a lot of dick to swallow
They rather me hit the follow than hit the lotto
It's like my drip on auto-pilot, 'til tomorrow I been chillin'
You way behind the wave, you at the shoreline
I'm Walter Elias Disney, Arnie Palmer when I hit green
The ganja in the '60s, I won't  if it's this weak
God inside my city, the monster in your kid's dream
Bottle of the whiskey got my head feelin' like shit
The first dollar in your piggy bank
I'ma drink away until my liver break
Yeah, one in a million like findin' love on a Tinder date
Livin' great, swear I'm Justin Timberlake
Sharp as scissor blades or winter skates
I been in the kitchen like Minute Maid
And these bitches on my dick parades
But I leave 'em quicker than a lizard's legs
Oh well, they love me like I'm Nick Lachey
Triple play, in your face, fuck 'em all, give 'em AIDS
I eliminate then go away on Christmas break
I ain't dealin' wit' your shit today
Gettin' finished like a dinner plate
Or a Philly steak
Oh, you special, anybody ever told you? 
Ooh, you so special, has anybody ever told you? 
Do they know you so special? 
You so special 
You so special 
You so special 
Yeah 
I know what she want, I know what she like
I know what she want, I know what she like, yeah, yeah
I know what she want, I know what she likeYeah
Mmm
You set the table, I set a date
They gettin' antsy, I tell 'em, "Wait"
First thing you do is you make the money, baby
Next thing you do is you make mistakes, yeah
They keep on tellin' me, "Take a break"
But I swing for the fences, don't play it safe
Yeah, all that I know is hundred percent
Unplug the connect, then to the check, straight to the bank 
And this is far from a gimmick
Do not waste my time, not a minute 
They run they mouth like a new kinda fitness
But the room quiet soon as I get in it, bitches
Get up and climb, I know they
Keep hatin' on mine, but it's okay
Empires fall, I've seen it all
I've seen it all and you can't take it to the grave
You can't take it to the grave
What the fuck you tryna save? If it ain't yourself, then hey
One day, it just goes away
You can't take it to grave with ya, with ya, with ya
You can't take it to grave with ya, with ya, with ya
Yeah
They bein' careful, they all afraid
And so insecure, should be ashamed
I got 'em sweatin', you feel the heatwave
Without standin' next to an open flame
Look at the bullshit I overcame
Swear that I'm spoiled and overpaid
Straight to the head, right to the brain
Crazy as heck, take no offense, that's how I'm made, yeah
And all I wanna hear is crickets
Can I mind my motherfuckin' business? 
Well, if you gonna hate, then be specific
'Til the day I'm sleepin' with the fishes, I'ma be...
Me, myself, and I, no, I won't change
I get up, get high like the old days
Empires fall, I've seen it all
I've seen it all and you can't take it to the grave
You can't take it to the grave
What the fuck you tryna save? If it ain't yourself, then hey
One day, it just goes away
You can't take it to grave with ya, with ya, with ya
You can't take it to grave with ya, with ya, with yaEvet, bir süper kahraman olmayı istiyordum
Pelerinimle etrafta uçup kötü adamları yakalamayı
Şimdiyse başım suyun altında
Ama ne duştayım ne de vaftiz ediliyorum 
İyi ve kötü zamanlara 
Tüm yaralara, kırık kemiklere ve siyah gözlere 
Genç şerefsiz, çılgın aklıyla
Birkaç milyon kazandı rap satırlarıyla
Artık daha fazlasını söyleyemezsiniz bana
Bu katın altındaki bodrumdan geldim
Yakınıma gelemezsiniz, G.O.A.T. olduğumu dahi bilmiyorsunuz
Nasıl gittiğimi bilmenize gerek yok
Çünkü ben ne istediğinizi biliyorum
Tek yapmak istediğim en fazlası
İpin üstünden geriye takla, posttayken sky hook
Evet, kızımsa “choke” olmak için fazla “clutch”
Ve bıraktığımı söylemiyorum
Tuğlalarınla bir duvar inşa edebilirsin
Ben bu boku konuşmaya devam ederken, aynen böyle 
İçki hâlâ bardağımda 
Uyandığımda kafam hep güzel 
Çünkü her şey haddini aştı 
Peki öyleyse? 
Parlak bir fikirle uyandım bu sabah 
Belki de sonsuza kadar var olurum burada 
Evet 
Hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm, hmm
Tamam, tamam
Öyleyse, bir süre burada olacağım, beklediğimden daha uzun bir süre
Şehrin dışındaydım, kurtarılana dek kayboluyordum
Şimdiyse bulutlardayım, jet yakıtım tükendiğinde aşağı geleceğim
Ama jet yakıtım asla tükenmeyecek
Öyleyse, bir süre burada olacağım, beklediğimden daha uzun bir süre
Şehrin dışındaydım, kurtarılana dek kayboluyordum
Şimdiyse bulutlardayım, jet yakıtım tükendiğinde aşağı geleceğim
Ama jet yakıtım asla tükenmeyecek
Sürmediğim bir araba için 120 bin dolar 
Yol kenarına bile çekmiyorum onu
Kaçırmıyormuşçasına yapıyorum atışları 
Yüksek bahislere asla limit koymam 
Kartımı çekmeye çalışıyorum, onlara balık tutmalarını söylüyorum 
Yüzümde tek bir yalan bulamazsın
Kaldırıyorum ve hızlıca gitmesine izin veriyorum
İstedikleri şey am, benim —dan
Evet, bilmediğim hiçbir şeyi konuşmam
Üstümde Polo’yla çıktım rahimden
Herkes katılmak ister ama ben old school’um
Yalnız kurdum, tekte alırım hepsini, evet
Kimseye ihtiyacım yok 
Kimse olmaya ihtiyacım yok 
Sadece işimi yapıyorum
Takılıyorum evimde, hiç kimseyi göremiyorum, hayır
Yani oralarda bu saçmalık
Bu tarafta ihtiyacımız yok ona 
Şu yeni bokun içinde geliyorum
Sense her zaman sikin üstünde takılıyorsun 
Senden istediğim şey saygı
Bağlantımı paylaşmayacağım 
Şunu açıklığa kavuşturalım, ben buradayım
Sıradakinin kim olduğu umrumda değil, ben genç veteranım 
Unutuyorlar gibi hissediyorum, bu seferlik görmezden geliyorum
Yaklaşık 25 yıldır kafam güzel, daha azı değil 
Siktir, biliyorum, tahmin etmiyorum
Daha çok parılda, streslenmiyorum
Bu boku ciğerden söylesen iyi edersin
Tamam, tamam
Öyleyse, bir süre burada olacağım, beklediğimden daha uzun bir süre
Şehrin dışındaydım, kurtarılana dek kayboluyordum
Şimdiyse bulutlardayım, jet yakıtım tükendiğinde aşağı geleceğim
Ama jet yakıtım asla tükenmeyecek
Ama jet yakıtım asla tükenmeyecek 
Öyleyse, bir süre burada olacağım, beklediğimden daha uzun bir süre
Şehrin dışındaydım, kurtarılana dek kayboluyordum
Şimdiyse bulutlardayım, jet yakıtım tükendiğinde aşağı geleceğim
Ama jet yakıtım asla tükenmeyecek
Ama jet yakıtım asla tükenmeyecek 
Kader senin ellerinde
Sen, beni bekliyorken
Ben çoktan oradayım
Derinlere düşüyorum
Şu an, şu andan ibaret
Yeryüzüne ilerleyelim sevgilimYeah, yeah, yeah
I wonder, can I make a little money without sellin' my soul?
You know you'll never be the shit if you ain't smellin' your own 
And even God gave the Devil a home
Now the evil live in all of us, wherever we go
I had plans to be a innovator
This flight simulator, flyin' through the Himalayas
Sips from a blissful nature
There's blood on the hands they've been grippin' paper
The man in the mirror always my biggest hater
Bullshit for later, Malcolm, need to focus
I know you got emotions that are kinda hard to cope with, but
You gotta stay strong and always act cordial
Shit, I do drugs 'cause they help me feel normal
I'm a man of good morals, got millions in the plural
Would go to outer space if you informed to where the portal is
Knew I was the one, but never got to hear from Morpheus
Life get interestin' when you realize how short it is
And you don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
But you still try
'Cause you won't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Until you die, yeah
Yeah, six thousand dollar Versace shoes
I would burn 'em in a second, materials are nothin'
But I'm addicted to stuntin'
And I grew into a person I'm kinda wishin' I wasn't
I'm so happy when I'm drunk though
Feelin' so free when I'm high
Two packs a day, you could say I upgraded
But fuck bein' famous, I just wanna be alive
Sometimes I can't sleep, I can't live with myself
I don't even know what it is I don't like
The hot days and cold nights start to feel repetitive
The exorcist tried to take his own life
While trippin' on acid, I started to bug
'Cause the things I did to her make it harder to love
Before I sunk deep in this yellow submarine
Had to realize where I was
And you don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
But you still try
'Cause you won't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Until you die, yeah
Oh, oh 
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Doh-doh-doh-doh, da-doh-doh
Da-da-da-da, da-doh-doh
Da-da-doh-doh
Doh-doh-doh-doh, da-doh-doh
Da-da-da-da, da-doh-doh
Da-da-doh-doh
I got this motherfuckin' friend
That I kinda get at her friends
Have fun on 
Have fun on the way to Venice
I got money on my mind
And 
If you gotta get in front of
The front of the race
I hardly try to fill the fun and the smile a waste
I be the bank, when I'm  face
I got a buncha motherfucker that lie to my face
And everybody at the night, I love the way that you touch
I think about it too much
I just wanna give you my love

On Fourth Street, the orphan children play on the jungle gym
Little Timmy broke his arm again on the monkey bars
Johnny's dad got a nicer car than all the other kids
He becomes the alpha and picks on everybody else
Max protects Claire from all the bullies
Claire always wish she was as pretty as Julie
The boys always chase Julie around the sandbox
Claire just waits ’til she gets picked up by her grandpa
All of this before the brainwash starts
Before they get polluted, start thinkin' like adults
Life is fantasy and somersaults then
Before the world tear apart imagination
Before there were rules, before there were limits
Your only enemies were 
Me, I used to want to be a wizard, when did life get so serious?
Whatever happened to apple juice and cartwheels?

Stuff ya body parts in a locker
Runnin' from the cops, Willy Parker
And I ain't gonna walk on ya set get you wet
Cause ya set full of talkers
Straight snitches, I'll punch you in the face
Leave you with eight stithces, bitches I play viscous
Title is inevitable, I'm incredible
Got lames hidin' behind frames like I was federal
The fuckin' general, suck up on my genitals
My flow's outta this world like I got some tentacles
I'm with the pencil to murder instrumentals
I'm spittin' ammunition, you better listen to potential
I'm fifteens years with no restrictions on the mental
My mind flows as I go, I follow where I'm sent to
Me and Mac blow ya back when we writin' it
Or freestylin' on some ill, that's excitement
Keep a fat a sack and a gat at the side of him
And kiss ya snakes tryna take what I'm hidin' in
I spit it slick, so sick need a vitamin
Aim it at ya forehead, leavin' four dead
Bust in the door with lead and whores spread
I'm a warhead, looking for more head
Fuckin' on the floor til I gotta sore head
Pussy lips drippin' stingin' like a hornet
Kickin' bitches out the door in the mornin'
Rappers tryna spit it but the shit is corny
I ain't even wit it, man forreal
I'm not the best in school but I'm set for college
Cause when the bitch give me brains, yo I get some knowledge
I keep a few close friends and the rest will tarnish
A few respectable rappers, the rest are garbage
I proceed to gain yardage, this ain't Dwayne Carter
I make it rain harder, game remain slaughter
My brain remains smarter and you stay retarded
You better add another name to today's departed
I never wake up and lose my skill
I get baked up and use em, ew!
The music real and every day I be movin' bills
Makin' cake, hittin' jakes, puttin' dudes in jail
And I'll tell you what they say right before they arrest you
Anything you say can and will be used against you
And even though they got no reason to resent you
They treat you like you got a set of criminal credentials
And me and B-DuBB are here to murder the game
We gon' spit off every minute until you heard of the name
We kickin' it exquisite, sittin' and gettin' lifted
Bangin' music until the neighbor's pissed and I'm evicted
Cause I be gettin' verbs workin' until I hear them birds chirpin'
Yeah preferred first person in here, you heard certain
Flirtin' with the lyrical spheres, ya ears hurtin'
Merkin' every peer that appear, ya fears worsen
I thought ya mothafuckas already knew
Easy Mac but his mackin' ain't easy
And next comin' up is Beedie
Kill the shitThe lazy guy is sleepin' on your couch again
Responsibility it would seem is now drownin' him
"You get another suicidal thought," I told him, "Count to ten
Or go up to the roof and look down at all the happy people"
My shit is mad cerebral, paintings on a magic easel
Bunch of saints acquainted with Satan, now they actin' evil
A walkin' magnet, absorbin' your core's energy
Squeezin' beetle juices from Lennon to form remedies
A bit menacing, sadistic feelings festerin'
Beat you while you sleepin', let you dream with all that hemorrhagin'
A world of lemmings, zombies and happy endings
People that keep pretendin' they entertainin' a fantasy
In the shallow water you treadin'
Put your feet down, you might just meet ground 
It all started with a freestyle 
It's gon' end with a beatdown 
You wish to enter into the forbidden cave where the monsters and goblins and fungus lives amongst the roses? There is no light here. There is nothing here for you. You would be better off if you just turned around and went back to your happy little life
Okay, live from a house that's made of porcelain
I ain't poppin' Mollys no more, I'm snortin' 'em
A bunch of powder I bought from Dr. Kevorkian
Do a line, stand up, start to play the accordion 
I'm bored again, my mind is runnin' suicides and hamster wheels
Lose your mind when you decide to swallow all Amanda's pills 
I pour liquor inside my chamomile
Eat banana peels and post up in the south of France
Fuck, I think I conjured up the wrong shit 
And now I'm being haunted 
Must be hallucinatin' all of this booty shakin'
Ah! Haha, yeah
Defeatin' Dracula to go and post in Africa
Open up Pandora's box and fuck it 
We live amongst the rubbish, but all my bitches busted when compared to me
Apparently the fairest in the land, bitch, I'm ghost 
Hahaha
If you could love, would you? 
Would you take the risk 
Of being vulnerable? 
I am not a man, but a mice with a hand 
I ate sushi twice in Japan
There's not a price on understanding this life that I'm reprimanding
There's no planning in the way that I be tanning in the sun 
The burnt one 
Shot from a Nerf gun with my third son
Don't alert none
'Cause you're for sure dumb when the herb come
I be getting—hahaha, what am I talkin' like that for?
Back me up, bro, more hip hopAyo, Phresh Muney

But I don't give a fuck 
'Cause I'm a regular guy
Hey, hey
I'm just a regular guy
Never said I was fly
But I'm higher than Willie Nelson was in '75
I spit ultra-violet rays, fans be gettin' a tan
The boy louder than some thunder, call him Kevin Durant
Hold your tongue, swallow both your hands
My people stick together like a colony of ants
No college plan, tryna get more dollars than a doctor can
My whip be full of kids like a soccer van
Maybe be in LA like a Dodger fan
Or in Miami with all the sand
I ain't worry 'bout poppin' tags, shoppin' bags
Cleaner than a laundromat
But regular enough that people walkin' past, him
No need to hide my face like a hockey mask
'Cause I be in the open with my cocky ass
Went to school but can't remember what the lessons were
I'm just high as hell, I'm so regular
I don't wear the big chains, though
'Cause I'm a regular guy
And I ain't finna make it rain, girl

You think you buzzin' I ignore your hype
Freestylin' cause your ass can't afford to write
And me, well I do boast, but I'm too dope
Your whole crew chokes 'cause they know I chew most
Blue smoke and it's rolled in a cigar
Your girl won't let me hit 'cause she know that I'm a star
You act and can't spit, trapped in sandpits
You scruffy as a mutt, rockin' hats with dandruff
I wrote a whole zip, blow it in the air
I spit cancer, now you losin' all your hair

Yeah, yeah, um
I met her last summer at a concert
She's a little younger so quickly I knew I loved her
But, drunkenly I fumbled over wrong words
I just kept on speakin' as quietly she whispered to me
Love is the reason that the homies beefin'
Defeat the lonely demons
It's hard to go to sleep when all you see is
Her face and all the time that I wasted
So when my mind'll be faded, whether we die or we naked
Where do we go from here?
I fear that I will be alone somewhere
And she'll forget me like a old hobby
So deep inside you, I would like you for your soul
Can I cop that?
That's when I caught light of myself 
Gotta be somethin' more that I can't tell
Breakin' you down to size
There's gotta be more to life than myself
That's when I caught light of myself
Gotta be somethin' more that I can't tell
Breakin' you down to size
There's gotta be more to life than myself
That's when I caught light of myself
Gotta be somethin' more that I can't tell
Breakin' you down to size
There's gotta be more to life than myself
That's when I caught light of myself
Gotta be somethin' more that I can't tell
Breakin' you down to size
There's gotta be more to life than myselfShe's my divine love
We fly, these skies were made for us
They're made for us, yeah
And she know how to keep me high, she's my drugs
We try, we try, but they're never enough
But they're never enough
I thought my angel was supposed to save me
Instead she wanna strangle me, choke, and rape me
Ride around the city in an old Mercedes
Always wanna drive but you drove me crazy
She was supposed to teach me how to fly
All she did was teach me how to fly, yeah
Cross my heart, put a needle in my eye
She made the demon in my mind
But the sex so good and I need it
I tell the whole entire world  your secret
A lot of screamin'
Jesus Christ, I'll be polite
You see, fuckin' is how we fight
Pussy so good, it got a hold of me
Pussy so good, keep control of me

And don't you bother talkin' to me
I got everything that I need
Yeah, let me move, gimme room, let me breathe
Yeah, I tried to leave it alone
But the feelin' too deep in my bones
Out the window, I was seein' the road
Nobody home though, each to their own
Yeah, and you can give it a try
Come fuck with me, get high
Yeah, I keep a bitch on my side
But she'll never be as pretty as I
La-la-la
Where did my days go?
Spend a lot of time with my bankroll
I know you got your eye on that halo
You just wanna fly
And don't you dare tell me you sorry
You just'd be wastin' my time
I don't got much more to give
I mind my business, let me live
I don't have a problem with you
I let you do what you do
Yeah, let me move, gimme room, let me breathe
And don't you bother talkin' to me
I got everything that I need
Yeah, let me move, gimme room, let me breatheYeah, okay
Uh, I'm the protector of the network
Invent the architecture, make the world around you better
The artificial intelligence to apply the pressure
The paranoia always keep 'em in line
If you speak the language, then you readin' my mind
The abstract has no reason to rhyme
Uh, no need to define, the rules are here to keep you alive
Oh Lord, I think I'm seein' the signs
So step aside, the evolution, death by execution
Fresh air with less pollution, let the Earth be Earth
They computin' the solutions, tryn' to find out how we do it
It's the fuckin' revolution, let the church be church, yeah
I'm fishin' from the moon, see how my dreams work
Give you what you want, but bet I'm takin' what I need first
I never said I was an expert, but
You now connected to the network
Uh, I'm the protector of the network
Invent the architecture, so it's good for our successors
Live inside of a spaghetti western
I've been thinkin' I could hide in here forever
Yeah, they stimulate us with simulated creations
We built this nation on the basis of a fairy tale
I beg you, can you disconnect me from this fuckin' matrix?
The steak is tasteless and the air is stale
Fallin' for a hummingbird, wonder who discover her
I want to touch her, but the feelin' of it's much too pure, yeah
And the lamb belong to Mother Earth
Forget it for a second, the corrupted gonna turn us into customers
The garden started from the dirt, we need to quench the thirst
You want the answers? Better plan to have adventures first
Shit, I never claimed to be a expert, but
You now connected to the network
Yeah, let me welcome ya to the network
We wage the war and technology surrendered
Remember, please embrace the spirit of your elders
I see myself as but a welder, keepin' it all together
Starin' at confusion
You nothin' but a boy, how do you dare to have delusions?
Shit, my mind's playin' tricks on my vision, see the picture changin'
Switch arrangement, watch the beauty turn to pixelation
There's nothin' pure as the birth of an idea
I know what I fear, I feel it's safe to die here, so
I close my eyes and raise my arms in triumph
If there's answers somewhere, then I got time to find 'em, yeah
I been hidin' inside of my dreams
Was born an angel, they tryin' to buy my wings
I'm a king, not a expert
But you connected to the network
It's the network
A'ightYeah
Yeah
Look, yo
Have you ever felt like no one understand what you loved?
Demanding a hug, can't reach you when you standin' above
I got dreams which I need to accomplish, I promise
I'm honest, clean my conscience, see the nonsense
Good days are gone, they used to be here
Life is but a dream doesn't seem to be clear
Been meanin' to write my thoughts down, jot down my mind
Take the words I can't say and put 'em into rhymes
So I'm up all night on this beat up mic
Convincing myself that I can't cheat on life
So papa don't preach, and mama don't worry
Nothing's gonna hurt me, growin' up in a hurry
I'm still learnin', waitin' for your teachin'
In this game of life that I seem to be beatin'
What the right thing to do isn't always understood
And some evil in the world is hidin' under good
Life ain't easy, don't put it past the name
Runnin' in the coins  sacks of change
Tryna save up money for the microphone
And while everybody's out I just write at home
'Cause to achieve you need to leave things behind
Wear the rhyme book out 'til you can see the spine
Read between the lines, more than appears to be
Wonder who I'm here to be so I clearly speak
Sit back with my feet up on the chair
I relax, 'cause when the worlds gone rap will be there
Don't have to be scared, just sit back and chill
I attack these wack cats with the rappin' ill
Pass the  'cause I'm tryna get faded
It's sacred passin' round the blunt, it's the greatest
I wasted payments, just to get the tree
Now I'ma stop talking, so y'all can check the beatUm
Hey, this some real fake shit
Yeah
Yo, yo, yo
Um 
Um, so don't you ever wanna hide away? 
Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain 
Don't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today 
I greet the devil with a smilin' face 
Shit, that God fellow may reside in space 
See, times are wastin', I'm freebasin' with Freemasons
My girl's switchin' the locks, the keys keep changin' 
Dreamin' of places, my own personal creations
If there's a party in Heaven, I plan to leave wasted 
Retracin' my steps way back to biblical times
We all gon' end up meetin' at the finishin' line 
Drop a book above your head, watch it cripple your mind
Fuck 
Um, I'm watchin' these bombs droppin' with Tom Coughlin
Got a bitch, but he cock-blockin', I gotta stop 'em 
Molly poppin' with Dermontti Dawson, not a problem 
This random thought might just set me free 
What if Galileo conversated with Plato
'Bout bitches with fat asses who like to snort yayo off the
Same table the children were playin' Dreidel on? 
You kill the Cain, get your Abel on 
I'm a saber-tooth tiger with good posture
Young grasshopper, money that last longer than good karma 
You finish quickly like Garfield lasagna
Arnie Palmer's around my team  gees
Girl, you the best I'll never see 
Let's um, reconvene in my dreams and start clean 
These blonde freaks are right to the arm's reach 
But we should just leave to the suite down in Palm Beach 
It calms me to know that we all free 
So harm me, better come with your army 
'Cause there ain't no tellin' what we do in space 
If the aliens came to change the human race 
Talk about a bunch of meaningless crap 
Things I think sound intelligent are probably irrelevant
Rememberin' the team I'm assemblin' 
I'm the boss, better let me win, ladies and gentlemen 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Ayy Okay
Chillin' for an hour, smokin' weed, watchin' Worldstar
Benz in the garage, pro'bly gotta drive your girl car
You ain't a rapper if my homies never heard y'all
I just spit a punchline, smile then they bird call 
Hit your sister in the face with a Nerf Ball
Dealin' with some shit that really don't concern y'all
Punch a fan if he get a fucking word wrong
Wavy, givin' you some shit that you can surf on
 findin' me a bitch I can swerve on
Frank Thomas, homie, 'bout to put the hurt on
Your bitch a night light, in bed she turned on
I roll some weed, tell her burn one, burn one
Okay
I used to give a fuck about success
Now I just want to see Mila Kunis undress
Hope she down for butt sex, it would be a cum fest
Uh, sorry, that's some shit I had to confess
Crazy-ass bitch doing 911 threats
Came in the game smoking Newport Hundreds
Now I'm at the top and the crown fit, gold on my outfit
Surrounded by the pussy I'ma—Pat
You got that wet pack, bitch, come and gimme that
You know we wanna know where them titties at
Got 'em gassed, they be askin' what I'm cooking wit'
Have your little brother ask your moms what a pussy is
Corruption, stunting at the function
Your girl pussy smell like Sour Cream & Onion
Woo, pay attention, you gon' learn somethin'
Roll that weed up, and then we burn one
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys, they were up to no good
They started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, Holmes, to Bel-Air!"
Hands up, said put your, said put your motherfucking
Hands up, put your motherfucking
Hands up, your hands up
 hands up, hands up, hands up, yo, yo
Get 'em up
Now get 'em up, motherfucker, put 'em up

London keep your hands in the airYeah i know: The Moments]

Your whole frame fucked up and your form diminished
Passin' raps back and forth, like a ball in tennis

The only tool in the school is a pen and a ’pad
And Chemistry class, whoa, that's a lil’ bit irrelevant
Writin' rhymes through the class, boostin' my intelligence
Yo, I got a fetish for the fettuccine
Elders are gettin' jealous, they  fellow man
My kingdom is the limit, and my prison and I’m sick of it
It's Malcolm that in the Middle kid, and yes I'm sizzlin'

We the best, and we dressed in the freshest sneakers
Ill kids, yeah we still rip the best of pieces

Yo, I fill 'em up in a tight space like sodomy

Yo, Easy Mac gettin' back on some skate shit

Who put the spiders in my applesauce?
Took the pins out my hand grenade?
Somebody said that I deserve to die
I looked him in the eye and said the devil's not circumcised
Who put spiders in my applesauce?
Took the pins out my hand grenade?
Somebody told that I deserve to die
I looked him in the eye and said the devil not circumcised
So play me a song on the guitar
Got a rainforest in my cigar
There's knots in my yo-yo string
Put a crown on my stallion, I'm the Polo king
I fell in love with a go-go dancer, she's a single mom
The underdog, I like to play the game with Diddy Kong
She the god type, throw that bitch a Klondike
Everything is alright, see it's written in the Psalms
I told her I get rich off my little songs
Gave her a billion reasons that she should come along
Immediately, she dropped her shit
But everywhere I go, they tell me "Watch your bitch!"
God damn! I guess I got another one
Good vibrations, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch
I put the gourmet flavors inside the honey blunt
Got my head underwater but I ain't comin' up
Fuck air, my bitch's ass is like a plump pear
And she ain't pretty or ugly, I say she's just fair
Man this life is unfair
Okay I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nothin' to lose
And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two
Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?
I said I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nothin' to do
And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two
Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?
I'm readin' old Playboy magazines
Somethin' from the 50's when the journalism had its peak
You play the background, you just a member of the faculty
I'm actually out here decision makin'
Had to get my shit together, I was missin' payments
I just pray to God that my lady isn't famous
She threw the gown on and we hit the banquet
She got her own story; just let the bitch explain it:
Okay I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nothin' to lose
And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two
Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?
I said I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nothin' to do
And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two
Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?You see I spent a lot of time thinkin'
This my life and shit
Momma always told me I was gonna be a superstar 
Dream large, and it'll go so far , so far , so far, so far 
I'm on my way, I'm on my way , I'm on my way 
I'm on my way, I'm on my way , I'm on my way 
I'm on my way
I'm hands-down the illest to do it my age 
I can see the words conversate on my page 
The sentences stay jumpin' off the can'bis
All these metaphors and my pretzels starts to panic
Writin' so much the margin seem to vanish
Beatin' up a track gotta get a song a bandage 
Pictures all candid, feature presentation
Gonna make a movie out of every occasion
They can't stand it, that's why I got 'em hatin'
Blood pressure risin', heart start raisin'
Work hard, fuck a calory, I burn bars 
Pedal to the metal they'll earn hard
Everywhere I go, all the girls say I'm sexy
Tell 'em I can change they whole world if they let me 
Get me, a million people to speak to

But I see you

Uh, I'm on my way to the top of the world
But first I gotta get up off the top of your girl
A lot of distractions, no relaxin'
Money, music, promo, tourin', imagin', and ya fashion 
All gotta be right
Then you get your cream right 
But it's work, I ain't left the lab in three nights
My girl and me fight, sayin' I don't care
I got a lot of time and she sayin' I don't share 
When you on your way up to royalty
You gotta check all your people's loyalty 
See the Murray hot today
So I gotta keep it pushin', 'cause I'm on my way!
Momma always told me I was gonna be a superstar
Dream large, and it'll go so far, so far , so far , so far 
I'm on my way, I'm on my way , I'm on my way
I'm on my way , I'm on my way, I'm on my way
I'm on my way 
I got a ways to go 
But homie you don't know my name 
People say that I change, but it's so hard to stay the same 
So relax, relax, there's no need to worry 
Time is on my side now
There's no need to hurry 
Momma always told me I was gonna be a superstar 
Dream large, and it'll go so far, so far , so far , so far 
I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way

Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop itOh shit
Okay
People worship these idols 'til they come in contact with Gods
Hoes is all my disciples, you get mind fucked with these broads
Life is just a recital, better 'member all that you practiced
When I die, throw a couple bad bitches in my casket, whoa
Think it's time for a revolution, me and my dogs 'bout to start a riot
Still they sleeping but I'm eating, you and your people are on a diet
Tim Allen off Home Improvement, 'telligent but we going stupid
This the new shit, hit the strip club, see some hoes that I went to school with
Out in London like Lennox Lewis, bitch looking like Farrah Fawcett
I'm just tryna make better music, get this money, share the profits
Now this class gettin' led by students, smoke some weed, get head while I do it
Started out under the ground, they didn't fuck with me, now they all coming around
Money, I'm hunting it down, planting the seeds, working and watching it grow
I got so many ways I can make money, I'll always be straight, I just thought you should know
Been on my grind, taking what's mine, I got my eyes on the throne

Said, lookin' at my life, it's like you watchin' movies
Lookin' at my, okay, here we go
People worship these idols 'til they come in contact with Gods
Hoes is all my disciples, you get mind fucked with these broads
Life is just a recital, better 'member all that you practiced
When I die, throw a couple bad bitches in my casket, whoa
Fuck a day job, fuck a day job, got ya bitch here in just a tank top
Getting paid, roll my face off, bitch you're bank fraud: Bernie Madoff
Educate y'all then erase y'all, LL Cool J without the Kangol
I don't see the need to stunt, wish you the best, I'ma just light up this blunt
This bitch love me long time, don't know why she wouldn't
Say my D could win the Heisman, yeah, I'm Charles Woodson
Couple million off a tour, thats a lot of bookings
My bitches gorgeous looking, imported from the shore to Brooklyn
Coming from out of the 'Burgh, bitch, I'm absurd, fuck you, I hope you insured
Hating? I'll give you just what you deserve, that's my word, put it on all that I'm worth
Been on my grind, taking what's mine, I got my eyes on the throne
I'ma be fine, no matter the time, we all go along with the show, said

People
People, said people
Said people, yeah
People, yeah
Said
People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinkin' 'bout her all the time
I never seen somebody put together perfectly
Said, what would I have to do to call you mine?
Said, someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes, or you can walk in blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
Yeah, he ain't gonna break your heart again
Said, go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
But I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear-view
Oh—whoa—oh—oh
Oh—whoa—oh—oh—oh
Said, leave it all in the rear-view
Girl, you don't have to cry
Mend a broken heart, girl, if you can
Said, I don't expect you to be capable
Yeah, you got the world right in your hands
That responsibility is unescapable
Said, I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm havin' some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Yeah, don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
And I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Yeah, who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shootin' stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did I think I'm still myself
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
But I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
I said, we could change the world forever
And never come back again
And let's leave it all in the rear-view
Oh—whoa—oh—oh
Oh—whoa—oh—oh—oh
Said, leave it all in the rear-view
Girl, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh—whoa—oh—oh
It's all in the rear-view, girl
Oh—whoa—oh—oh, oh—whoa—oh
Said, leave it all in the rear-view, girl

I been having trouble sleeping
Battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing
Is it money, fame or neither?
I been thinking about the places that I frequent
All the people that I see
I’m just out here livin' decent
What do it mean to be a G?
And all the time we fall behind
Bitches in the concubine
I call her mine, crazy
She ain't' God as I
I make water wine
Pause in time
It's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line
I cross the T's and dot the I's
Wondering, well, wonderin' how I got this high
Fell asleep and forgot to die, God damn
I'm poppin' them downers
And drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter
I'm stuck on the browser
Like, how did I make it?
These bitches don't know me
This shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what today is
But I'll be good by the weekend, yeah
I'll be good by the weekend, yeah
Everything good by the weekend, yeah
Everything will be good by the weekend, by the weekend
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight, like fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight, fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight 
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight Intro:
Rolling on dubs, rolling on dubs, rolling on dubs
Rolling on dubs, rolling on dubs, rolling on dubs
Ladies and Gentlemen
Rolling on dubs, rolling on dubs, rolling on dubs
You are about to witness
Rolling on dubs, rolling on dubs, rolling on dubs
Rolling on dubs, rolling on dubs, rolling on dubs
To be honest, I don't know what the fuck you bout to witness
It’s gonna be something, and I made this beat bitch, this is um, to start it off, Bill the Kid
Verse - Bill the Kid:
On dreams, every time I come up with a scheme on scene
With the green on lean, seems so mean
Hoes coming out the freak bitch, you were watching tv
I'm just here for my team hoe
Got a mazy on my 1950 beam
So they know me as thе artist with a line of vintage t's on
We smokе peace hoe, throw does, speaking numbers
Just for weak kids to go home, we don’t know you
I roll whole foods and blow black l smoke, I'm on the pound now
You prolly think there was a clown, no
East side to Cali though, don't get it twisted
Cause we here loads down town, ribbons on a zipper hood
Crispy old stitching vintage pretty old hippy shit
Rather not shop and just go what I'm meant to get
For now I'm in the burgundy figures but California
Dreams, not so far distant here
I can't lie, like the earn of black instead of stripes
Flipping big birds on the curve, I can't turn to that
I'm in,where the airfield’s great, and I can never complain
I got a fam and we make ends
Make friends, know it’s blood or fuck off the dicks
All kicks not laugh, just all the pics
Red sheet you can't have, so I’m here with Mac
3 jays on the track while he rolls his pat
And I'll never let that back, so I used to hit mac off a pack
Just to get him cashed off
Now with past growing antique fabrics on it
Got me in this {?}
Verse - Franchise:
Gucci, Gucci, Louie, Louie, Fendi, Fendi, Prada
Ain't show up in none of that, but she fin to give up that slaba
Just a tlc fit and some based out vans
From the east side of Pittsburgh to studio city, we jam
You can bang it out your man or bang it out your sedan
Steamer to a ,pina got some purple
We stop smoking bullshit in '05, let that ,pass
I’m really pissed, , snoring off some silly chips
But since I'm on the west, I'm acting brand new, it's damn true
Might have one of mad Hollywood honeys
Hit up Demi Levato, let her hold his dick for
Me and Sofia Vergara, the pair while I'm out this way
No stunting, no fronting, we coast to coast man
You ain't getting to vip unless you most dope fam
{Willy Whip$}
My man Billy kinda silly with the zip to the piff
If he hand you one off better give it a wiff
Give  another 40 a bitch
The way we balling out, you would think that we rich
I see you already know how the most dope roll
Off the henny and the o if we blowing off something
Best believe it ain't that drough
Bitch suck my dick while I'm smoke this blunt, I'm gangsta
Wanna be part of the team, first compliment the genes
The drop portions, hit the compartment for the greens doing
Donuts inside the apartment of your dream
So turn around bitch, make that tootsie pop pop
Block like a volcano, we be pushing rocks hot
I'll do pulling no hoes, and you push a drop top
When I'm hopping out the coupe with the pipe and the palm
Lick my lips, raise my eyebrows, blow a kiss to your mom
Ask her listen  charm
So I'm hopin off the red eye
Hittin up your wifey
Hopin in the brown eye

Beedie, Crack, Mac Miller. Jimmie Hoffa
Holla at me, bro, I need a blunt to get me proper
I don't need a partner , we roll solo
I'm so low to the ground, this beat is so cold
This weed is so cold, it keep me loco
Ayy, low key when I'm blowin' the haze
I blow smoke  the state I'm in
I'm for that gold medal spot, boy, I play it to win
I done been through hell and been back 
So when I been back, you can get your men clapped
Or get your gym snatched 
And that's how it's gotta be, 'cause I gotta get a lot of money
Just like the  wars, I'm a star
I'm sicker than swine flu,  and SARS
So I don't need a story, I just point 'em to my scars
They swear life is hard 'til you in that foreign car 
I keep a foreign broad to 
And give me head while I'm workin' on my bars
Like a bag off of , I'm way above par
And your 
See, that's why I'm  like unleaded
Cut straight to the top, I am GPS headed 
But still in the hood like  and bad credit
So you can't pull my card 'cause I don't even own a debit 
And I'm just stuntin' on you hoes
Brushin' off my shirt and I ain't doin' shows
But I'm very much a pro 'cause I can kill 'em with the flow
And ever since the late '90s I been 
Uh, Rocky Stallone boxin' a pro
So if you steppin' up, you'll get knocked in ya dome
You got style I can mop the floor with
'Cause y'all just bug like locust and roaches
Walk into a restaurant, always spittin' game on the hostess
Approach with swagger, take notice, never lose focus
I'm gettin' dough up in my pockets
It's all about the profit when you dealin' with the chronic
Got a backpack  scale
My old heads told me, "If you look back, you're frail"
So no lookin', I'm ready to go
Mind on the money, head on my dough
Me, Hoff and Beedie ready to blow
And y'all act like we haven't said it befo'
So from Pittsburgh to Boston
No options, it's hip-hop to the coffin, bitch"Giving people what they love"
Mac Miller 
What up, Q? 
What up, Jerm? 
I see y'all, man 
It go one, two, three and to the four
Drums goin' bang, put holes in your flow
Got 'em in the crowd, packed-tight 
But the party stay goin' all night, open door
It go one, two, three and to the four
Drums goin' bang, put holes in your flow
Got 'em in the crowd, packed-tight 
But the party stay goin' all night, open door 
First class, y'all just secondary 
At the bar, no I.D. necessary 
Gettin' loose like untied shoes
 drink and I'm dumb high too
Rock the cradle, liquor in the ladle
Young boys head stay spinnin' like a dreidel 
And hoes let me stick it like a staple 
Gettin' brain while I'm sittin' watchin' cable 
And that's just the life I live
You ain't ever met nobody quite like this 
I'm just a kid with a troublemaking nature
Lookin' for a way to double up my paper
Ayy, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu haters 
The game's just hungry for some flavour 
And I'm flavourful, I don't spend a day in school
Treatin' every second of the day like it's April Fools 
Bunch of shows in a row, call 'em Pay-per-view
Have the whole crowd hollerin', "Raise the roof"
Like it's '80 or '85
In the Shadow Lounge right by Shady's side
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep
So, like I said before, I don't know nothin' about dumbin' shit down. Alright 
What? What? What? What? What? 
Ain't none of y'all better than Mac, riddle me that
Competitors gotta give the kid a pat on the back
I'm spazzy with rap, givin' honeys asthma attacks
How I take their breath away then tell 'em pack up they bags
Ayo, Mynd Tek, bring that back, ma'fucker
DJ Mynd Tek
Ain't none of y'all better than Mac, riddle me that
Competitors gotta give the kid a pat on the back
I'm spazzy with rap, givin' honeys asthma attacks
How I take their breath away then tell 'em pack up they bags 
The girls still love me and it's havin' you mad 
'Cause in the mornin' she gone leave my crib, catchin' a cab
I feel bad, you can get a job fetchin' my bags
Minimum wage, you can learn a lesson from that
And Mac's still talkin' here in the third-person
You heard certain I'm word servin' 'til the birds chirpin' 
I don't rest, I'm awake, call me Adderall 
With the off the wall raps, call me racketball
 poison ivy on my basketball 
I can feel the money, I'ma have it, y'all 
Pocket of fire, ain't stop 'til I'm high or
At the crib with some hoes, chillin', watchin' The Wire 
I see these other clowns and they gotta retire
'Cause wack music  is rotten, expired
Here it make you feel like you just poppin' your tyres
I just gotta enquire, "What the fuck is goin' on?"
Uh 
That's what the fuck it is

Okay, okay, okay, okay 
As I begin, as it begins 
Yeah , um, yeah
Double-sided silver dollar 
Mac Miller  beginner's fathers 
I'm not drownin', I'm wadin' in the water
Killin' off these monsters ever since I was a Sabra
I got horses on the PJ's 
Shout to spitta jet life, I fit the Porsches on the PJ's 
I'm on stage, sendin' dark forces to my DJ
And TreeJ like, "Boogie-boogie"
Pittsburgh warrior , bullets in my cornea 
In exelsis Deo, Deo, this is Gloria 
Ave Maria , I'm gettin' bread, yeast rise on Easter
Money is God
Love black bitches with jungle fever, it's on
The lion kingdom, gettin' high, singin' "La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da"
Yeah , my pockets got the universe in 'em
My pockets got the universe in 'em 
Yeah, my pockets got the universe in 'em
My pockets got the universe in 'em 
Yeah, my pockets got the universe in 'em

Somebody said that you deserve wisdom 
So, here goes some wisdom 
Fuckin' right? Yeah
Chuck, what's good, buddy?
Fuck you lookin' at, man? You got a eye problem?
Aight, look
Girl, go and lose it, get stupid
While we watch them hoes dance to the music, actin' stupid
You don't need to study, just shake that ass for a little bit of money
Girl, go and lose it, get stupid
While we watch them hoes dance to the music, actin' stupid
You don't need to study, just shake that ass for a little bit of money
Hey, get stupid, you a dummy
Only nineteen, all the older hoes love me
Everyone know, ain't nobody here that fuck with me
My homie Inglish brought the cash, call him Chuck E. Cheese
I'm a cool kid in my nеw kicks
Got me lookin' flyer than a broomstick
Walkin' by thesе girls and they get undressed
I'ma spend all of this money 'til there ain't nothin' left
I'm a young Donald Trump, you the type I call a chump
Turnin' up my music, make the speakers go bump
And they got me drunk, and this weed got me faded
Girls all tryna act like they pussy so sacred
Say you wanna fuck but it ain't because I'm famous
That's bullshit, you just want some rapper mixtape dick
My mistake 
'Cause everywhere I go, they say This one's for the struggle
This one's for the hustlers
I like my Hennessy straight, baby, without no chaser
Got no time for love, 'cause I'm in love with the paper
So go 'head, leave, I'll be right here when you wake up
Still hustlin' every single bit of that 
'Cause I'm on my grind 
Because i'm on my grind 
Because I'm on my—
Yeah, I struggled a lot , so I'm puffin' on pot
And inhalin' the smoke, and not carin' at all 
I got problems, but a bitch ain't one 
If she's in love with mе, then the bitch ain't dumb 
'Cause I nеver had an ex that i ain't made cum
Just like I never had a slut that I kissed with tongue
See, there's rules to the G code, and every G knows
You treat a ride-or-die different than your ski ho 
So I got three hoes that give me deep throat
And then they leave 'til the next time I creep though 
I got a mean flow, and way too much ambition 
Marine's instinct, and hustler's intuition 
I got a fighter's heart , and a killer's vision 
And a soldier's pride , and a teacher's wisdom
And a legend's mind, and nothin' else is missin' 
Except for open ears, I like when people listen
I like my Hennessy straight, baby, without no chaser
Got no time for love, 'cause I'm in love with the paper 
So go 'head, leave, I'll be right here when you wake up 
Still hustlin' every single bit of that 
'Cause I'm on my grind  
Because i'm on my grind  
Because I'm on my—
Uh, I'm on my grind, and you never see me take a rest
So a hater's best bet is to save your breath 
And when nothin' seem right, I'ma take a left
Workin', movin', makin', checks, grindin' for this paper fest 
So  the time 
I'm on my grind 
Never in recline , it starts to hurt my spine 
But I know it takes some workin' for the shine 
Everyone in my whole damn camp eatin'
Know we stay feastin' with our own hands, feedin'
Y'all ain't even cheatin', get up on our level 
Yeah, we got drive like the pedal to the metal 
And y'all just neutral , cruise control 
Same damn speed, movin' super slow 
When I'm sleepin' in the studio, I'm goin' hard like the Steelers in the Super Bowl
I'm on my grind
I like my Hennessy straight, baby, without no chaser
Got no time for love, 'cause I'm in love with the paper
So go 'head, leave, I'll be right here when you wake up
Still hustlin' every single bit of that 
'Cause I'm on my grind 
Because i'm on my grind 
Because I'm on my—Ayo, microphone check, one-two, one-two 
My name's Mac, what it do? 
I'm formerly known as Easy Mac
But I'm gettin' grown now, so I'm past all that
Mac Miller the rap killer, my track iller 
With mixtapes like crack dealers, I stack skrilla 
Fat Swishers at the spot and the room fog
Go ahead and pick a beat out the jukebox 
You can try and stunt me
If you lucky, you may catch me when I'm hungry 
Just grumpy on the beat, takin' all that I can eat
Like a buffet at a holiday suite, know what I mean? 
It's for the green like H&R Block
The jakes try and stop us, so I'm hatin' every cop that I see 
There to keep thе steets clean 
But they as dirty as a homelеss dude's jeans
 Mac with ease, and actually, the name  laughin' 
 attack like assassins
That's just what the fuck happened 
Like I said, muhfucker, I still mack easy
Just holla "Mac Miller" when you see me 
Now holla "Mac Miller" when you see me 
I said holla "Mac Miller", it's easy Sour Hour
I'm flyin' away
Here I go, here I go
Got a little bit of drink in my cup
Little something to smoke, a little something to smoke
Call me later, call me later
I ain't comin' back around
Call me later, call me later
'Cause I don't think I'm comin' down
Haha, uh
You can find me way up in the clouds, flyin' through the stratosphere
Don't need three strikes to know I'm outta here
, boy, I ain't even on your radar
Learned to play every single game like it's the playoffs
I ain't got a day job, chillin' for the moment
Blowin' potent, my schedule's pretty open
Eat, chief, grind and sleep
And if I'm in the mood go and find a freak
I am above and beyond, puffin' 'til the weed gone
Eons and eons, I'm tryna get my cheese long
Cup of tea and some china plates to eat on
Tempur-Pedic mattress that I count my sheep and sleep on
Flyer than a helicopter, homie, you a kamikaze
Feelin' good like I popped a molly
Drivin' slow, I ain't gettin' stopped by no cops
Speakers keep punchin' like a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot 
I'm flyin' away
Here I go, here I go
Got a little bit of drink in my cup
Little something to smoke, a little something to smoke
Call me later, call me later
I ain't comin' back around
Call me later, call me later
'Cause I don't think I'm comin' down
Uh-huh, yeah, look
I smoke my weed from the Garden of Eden
Followin' a dream that ain't hard to believe in
My money European, got a market in Sweden
Hittin' on this L 'til it's harder to breath and to see
No iPhone, I got a 'droid, bitch
I'm makin' money now, you unemployed, bitch
Ha, 24, livin' at your moms crib
Get ya ass up, go and get a job, shit
I'm on the road, puttin' money in my pockets
Plus the kid got the finest ho to go to prom wit'
To be honest, I'm the illest now
For real, I'm feelin' like killin' it up in Tinseltown
Ask the bitches I'm hittin', they know I get around
You? Another face in the crowd
I'm stayin' on your girls mind
She screamin' out like it's her first time, ha
"Hey, man, we're out of papers."
"All right. Then get me a toilet paper roll, a corkscrew and some tin foil."
"We don't have a corkscrew."
"All right. Then get me an avocado, an ice pick and my snorkel. Trust me, bro. I've made bongs with less. Hurry up!"Kickin’ it like I’m muh’ fuckin’ TimmyThicc, yuh
Catch a trick, she gon’ ride up on my muh’ fuckin’ dick, yuh
You already know he sendin’ put them threats
Put a blade up to his neck, yuh
Callin’ up the feds
Go and get yo flesh turned into shreds
She wanna have sex, uh
Stabbing bodys n pullin’ guts
Throwin tables jus’ for fun
Pull the trigger, pull ‘em, son
Take him out and fuck him up, uh yuh
I rip skin like I’m, Ted Bundy, ayy
Heard you think this shit is kind of funny, ayy?
Lift my side, turn ‘em to a runner, ayy
Savor him like I’m muh’ fuckin’ Jeffrey Dahmer, ayy
Kickin’ it like I’m muh’ fuckin’ TimmyThicc, yuh
Catch a trick, she gon’ ride up on my muh’ fuckin’ dick, yuh
You already know he sendin’ put them threats
Put a blade up to his neck, yuh
Callin’ up the feds
Go and get yo flesh turned into shreds
She wanna have sex, uhStill can’t seem to figure out
What happens in my head
The thought alone is gonna kill me
Sick of living with this doubt
The pistol in my hand
I can end it all before the morning
The summertime always go come around
I'll be waiting for another smile, yeah
Let my feet off the ground
Try to hold on
But gravity won't let me go
This gravity let me go
Gravity won't let me go
This gravity won't let me go
Ooh oooh woo oh aaah
Ooh ooh oh oh
Ooh oh ooh ooh oh
The devil always smile when you need a friend
I'm laying on this cloud
It’s a long drive back to earth
Wonder when my happy days will fade away
Don’t breath on my parade
If it is only for this moment
So gravity let me go
Can ou please let me go
Let me go oh
Wooohoo will you let me get higher? 
I just wanna get higher
I wanna get higher
Said I wanna get higher
Said I wanna get higher
Let me get higher
I wanna get high
Said I wanna get high
Can you let me go?I just ain't gotta see these sad people who got raised up with that means
Most empty hands on the wheels, warmin up by the fears they on ride through the hills
Fuck around once on a high slope and I gone hear them cry life's a flop
I know people aimin high makin plans to get this money on to grow
Not even sitting they playin games betting that they will get this hoe
Say they master of their life until that they're broke
Then seein life as a hole diggin till touch on some gold
But I ain't wanna spend a whole life in a hole
Imma build and stand tall on my lands, live it by my own laws
Got two boats people rent, damn business for my time, guess who's fuckin director
I'm improvin once the chance there, my mind workin like a detector
Got my whole future in the hands, hope enough time to make it
Now I stop this pimpin I'm comin back to ya, not sure that I gave ya enough hits, yeah bitch
Gettin prepared for a post life, chekin out some LV pants
Askin yourself if it will fit, tryna make a complete plan
But you distract from the matter, you gon fall off the bridge
You feelin weak, you can't see end of the road, no wonder, no lane switch
Riches gonna be rich and poor gonna be poor
Ain't gotta work low if you wanna turn a
Ruined nigga into a nigga that merit dollars more
Hold the soul far from all wrong thoughts
Make a pure living without influence cause the smallest fault
Could be the biggest fall
Hook:
Nigga don't hang around, I like them niggas doin independent shit
No tags featuring my name, no headlines, I'm no name, It's self made shit
It's heart made, I'm beatin hard to bring head minds on light
Don't need no expensive shit
It's not a name who'll recover the fund of my art, the pain way deeper in the heart
It's bleedin out the pen and shit
Verse 2:
No shit no shit, I'd feel good the way everybody look at me
VIP shit, get through each door like I'm portunes holy keys
Got money to control, vices aren't consuming free
I know youths gettin faded and shaded and then hope that they'll make it
And cursin their future family tree by plantin these seeds
Say I'm too valuable of my life to get this weed
And say I should be yelling through the plains but I feel
How the system faked me born me with a silver spoon in the hands and greed
Fated to show my will, now they all see the bill
Now they want ball but spill over their mentality of mill
I know people grindin hard blaming me
For not being thankful, say I'm high and chill
Why the fuck feel I like my life ain't filled ?
Do I yet consider what I have or am I high on a trip ?
Is it my style or it's surroundings who're ill?
Human being diverse like a zoo but everyone still want it in his grill
I would put my enemies on a grill, swearin if the stake be there they would get evils
And it hurts to know that's the supposed company we live with
When everybody look at you, maybe McQueen shirts'll cover you
But one day, you'll have to tell the truth, to proof to the world you ain't no fool
Pray the angels grant a panda fur coat for a cold love
At least two bank accounts for my ladies, your job to spend it
Scopes turned towards me, complexion skills are lean
People sucking dick for piece of my kind, nothing of the shit is real
I just guess I'm too valuable of my life too live it free
Blue, white and red three questions mark an ethnicity and a riddle for me
Hook:
Nigga don't hang around, I like them niggas doin independent shit

Verse 3:
Claim it's my first first rap but my bars deeper you ever would expect
Life on a line but you blinded by the masses, only tryna follow fashions
Busy by your dope life, no time to be wise, I know you never had this education
Anyway it not seems in range of your imagination
Don't worry I'll give to ya, just lay back to your elations listening to my phrases
A quiet nap implicates a dozen of benzos
Couples of xanies because the pressure keeps holding me on
I know that's what they sippin when they call it a living and my finger is 'bout to make a killing
If they ask where I'm at, answer is I'm writin this, I just followed my instinct, that's the way it is
I didn't follow how the problems was pilin, though I could solve them peelin off and takin pills in
Much history in the tree I'm from, the mark ain't no scar, you don't know my sore
I 'member five years when my mom was poppin bottles on every friday
Ten years later we still not seen the payday
Her pain was her man, father's psychotic behavior'll never get away
Lord did life hard but lord did right cause now I'm here to tell her bad plays
I don't fault her, she's only human, I forgive, I know better days are on the way
Get in my shoes for a week and you'll stumble
I really don't like this style of being not humble
If you don't see through my eyes the tears that are stuck
You are danger for me, I just gotta keep duck

It's bleedin out the pen and shitHey, hey
I bet it must be nice chilling every day
Not really doin' shit, a couple million in the bank
I'm working all the time, never getting me a break
Fuck it, that's fine, not a minute go to waste
I just wanna be a legend, every second I got to be going in
A part of me want to chill, but a part of me want to win
No college paying my bills, I'm saying just what it feels
Cause haters be looking stupid when you just keepin it real
I got too much on my mind to care about the internet bullshit
When the people coming up sayin I'm forgetting who I am just because they
Random dudes I went to school with
I'm cool with chillin with some buddha smoke
I always do it big like a Jewish nose
Cadillacs I'm trynna get a few of those
Fuck stress, everything will be okay
Chorus:
How did you know I was feeling
So under the weather this evening
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
They say they love you, but they get it
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
Do you believe in fairytales, dreams come true?
One day you gonna make it
If they gave you hand out, and you were down, babe, would you take it?
I found out being famous in reality, well it ain't shit
Cause you could have the world in the palm of your hand
But it don't mean a thing 'til you change it
Listen, baby, I'mma be great now
We can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late
I'mma make my way to the top, every day I get closer
When I was young they told me to wait until I'm older
And turned a cold shoulder to me
And now they want tickets to my shows for free
Hey man, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?
Bitch suck my dick
Chorus:
How did you know I was feeling
So under the weather this evening
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
They say they love you, but they get it
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be alright
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be all right
Under the weather shit'll get better
Under the weather shit'll get better
The hate ain't gonna last forever, so I just smile, it's whatever
Under the weather shit'll get better
Under the weather shit'll get better
Don't let anybody say you can't, heart beatin like the 808
Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be alright
But everything will be all right!
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be alright
Chorus:

I'm a smooth criminal , put your life on critical 
Move miracles, smokin' blue medicinals 
Duckin' 'cause the jakes  still know the hustle for the cake 
Seekin' somethin' I can take, like all the money in the bank 
Guns, check, bags, check, suits, ammo and masks, check
Now we ready to go, waitin' for the driver
Got a homie watchin' Cops like MacGyver 
I'ma try to go by the book
Captain Hook, I'ma crook, look 
Stealin' just a hobby, son , and it's a lot of fun 
You need a Tommy gun? I'ma go and cop me one
Life's been nice , but you don't live twice 
So when they give you a chance, you better spin dice
Takin' it all, doin' it big, duckin' from the boys in blue and the pigs
Arrive  at 19th and 5th Street
Look at the bank, give a Grinch grin, big cheeks
Stealin' more than Christmas, cheddar by the pound
Robbin' and stealin', then coppin' them wheels, then lettin' off a round 
Tip-toe on that pink panther tip
Don't panic, bitch, and everyone will get a hand of chips 
Slide to the entrance, walk up to the stairs
Start shootin' our guns up in the air, this a
This a stick-up, everybody down on the ground
Feel me now, motherfucker?

This a stick-up, put your hands in the air 
Let me get that there , uh
You heard the man, this a demand, come up out them pockets 
Empty out ya wallets, necklaces and watches 
 and don't call the cops
I'd hate to have to watch as you all get shot, ha
There's someone at the door, knock-knock-knock-knock
Good thing we got the door locked 
Now show me to the vault , show me to the cash
Been rippin and spittin' this right, you don't even gotta ask 
Got class like a mobster, high school Sinatra 
Stay relaxed with a hit from the ganja
Calm, cool, collected, told Billy to shoot
Bullet shot through the air: Gimme the loot! Gimme the loot! 
The bank teller , well, he took us to the back
Lookin' like a black cat crossed his cat
Well, that's exactly what we goin' for 
Pulled out his key to open the door
There was money to the ceilin' , cake skyscapers 
Enough paper to pay five Lakers
Gold and silver, diamonds and jewels 
Anything you wanted you could find in this room 
Now my whole team rich, I don't believe this
This them straight-up Ocean's Thirteen shit
Jesse James, gettin' change, I'm an outlaw
And my boys let 'em bang, pull 'em out, draw!
With all this thoughts about livin' like 
We forgot about them people in the lobby 
Told the posse, "It's time to break"
The cake piles down the aisle of the bank, uh
This a stick-up, everybody down on the ground
Feel me now, motherfucker?
This a stick-up, put them hands in the air
Let me get that there, uh
This a stick-up, everybody down on the ground
Feel me now, motherfucker?

What's good, Rod?
Shit is cracked right here, it knocks
This to my motherfuckers who is money-hungry right now, yo
Recession is some bullshit, haha
But don't worry, we doin' this shit for the dollars, period
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll 
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that 
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin that 
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll 
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that 
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin that 
Never start a day with empty pockets
'Cause I seek profit, keepin' work likе a office
Stick-ups, grimy shit, gettin' it all
'Cause I ain't thе type of kid with a regular job
I'm 'bout my dollars like a register be
And if the cops get him, well, he ain't get it from me
I'm never sittin' in the cell, that's a livin' hell
I'm livin' well, buildin' business, call me Stringer Bell
Uh, waitin' in the alley with my hoodie up
'Cause this rapper hustle money ain't good enough
Top dollar, it's whatever with me
'Cause I ain't about college, try and get a degree
I'm 'bout this hustle money, rap money, fast money, cash money
Get in my way and I'ma do you like a crash dummy
I act funny, but don't get up on my bad side
Leave you hospitalized, broken bones and black eyes
'Cause tax high, and sometime the cake low
So I keep a couple homies on the payroll
Roll with hundreds, you know you love it
I make dough, bigger when you poke my stomach, ha
So call me for ya needs, whatever it is
If you need a cracked beat, you get it from Blizz
Mac Miller gettin' money in my hands
And you clowns is lookin' funny when you dance, ya bitch
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll 
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that 
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin that 
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll 
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that 
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin that 
And when the money comin' slow, I'ma pack my shit
Grab a fast, take a piff, and have that flipped in a day or two
Haze and brew got me feelin' days confused
Take your loot, ante up, you gotta pay me
Empty out ya pockets, necklaces and watches
I'm fetchin' me some profit, then I'm gettin' some exotic
'Cause I ain't tryna play with my money like Monopoly
I want a happy lil' end in my biography
A lot to read, chronic greens kids will cop from me
Stockin' cheese 'til I'm doin' this hip-hop for free
Smokin' kush 'til I'm higher than astronomy
They feeds from my jams like I'm spittin' out some poppy seeds
Bars is  to make me rich
It'll blow your fuckin' mind when you take that hit
You lil' pussies ain't makin' it, take a hint
In this game, we pimps, you gotta pay me, bitch
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll 
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that 
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin that 
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll 
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that 
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin thatI do it for the

Point Breeze, motherfucker, bet I'm reppin' that
I'm gettin' that
Yeah, it's like that
Flippin' and zippin' and gettin' this chips, check the price tag! 
And you snitchin' motherfuckers go and call the cops
Tryin' 'cause your little bitch ass got that molly wop
You sellin' weed, you a joke
You should probably stop 
Just answer my call, get robbed about ya 
I head to the mall to cop
Everything I got that Rosie O'Donnell guap 
She's fatter than that bitch, and that's a fact bitch 
You throw my cash on a bed it break the mattress
I used to not have shit
But this hustlin', this rap shit, added to my cash quick
Stack chips, spendin' them
Sexy hoes, message them
Invite them over, introducin' them to Benjamin 
You got your money, throw your hands in the sky
'Cause the cream gone stand by your side
Get, get that, get that 
And if you got your dollars put them hands in the air
If you got enough money to share
Get, get that, get that
I'm rockin' clean clothes, fresh like whoa!
Me and all my dogs is winnin' best in show
Havin' sex with hoes
And I ask them for they name
Givin' 20 dollar bills to , asking for some change
Prayin', get your hustle up
And don't come with no trouble stuff
You'll get jumped just like double Dutch
I roll a double Dutch, but see the huffin' puff
I got a couple  to put your lips in butternuts
They love the stuff
Talkin' bad on 'em
And if them hoes got clothes, throw some cash on 'em
I need them hoes with some titties and a ass on 'em
Flatback bitches I'ma pass on 'em 
Money over hoes when the money overflows
And hoes comin' in from the 
You know how it goes
It's for the cheddar, cheddar, cheese
If there's cake in my reach then I better get a piece!
You got your money, throw your hands in the sky
'Cause the cream gone stand by your side
Get, get that, get that 
And if you got your dollars put them hands in the air
If you got enough money to share
Get, get that, get thatLyrics from snippet:
Broken like a bone when I get hold of you, so don't you move
Hotel room of hoes come with ocean views
Heaven here below the roof, Heaven here below the roof
She lick the liquor off me
It's a hobby tryna keep all of these bitches off me
When they really want me in a
Dick , sick as Crosby
It isn't hockey, but this game is cold as veins that flow within a zombie 
Blessed when I'm in your body
The main event on every television set, so don't forget to watch me
Became rich, I ain't been the same since
Now my whip speak a different language, and it's always talkin'
I'm no angel, no wings, no halo
I got  ...
I know I'm hard to handle
Lookin' for me, find me at the bottom of a barrel
Yeah, work some other  curse like old Camaro
Lookin' like a pharaoh
Can't find the activist, these niggas sippin' yellow
I thought I always had to drink to try to fight the pressure
Now I go and spend the bank up on a normal necklace
Now I'm jumpin' in these bitches just to ease the pressure
I always keep ...Lyrics from snippet:
Can you take me to euphoria, according to the story of a warrior?
Picturin' my visions, have you look inside my cornea
Sunny California, sleepin' when the mornin' come
Movie theater in my crib, private auditorium 
Take you on a tour of the  Deloreans
Drive around the ground, we pour a 40 in
Champion of the tournament, the world's ornament
Fallin' to the Earth just to show you that we porcelain
 from Nova Scotia, was local but no exposure
I told 'em the show was over, it's all on both of my shoulders
Take me to a place, covered from head to toe in gold 
Find a space with skies 
And the weather never 
Don't leave me, don't let me die alone 
No, you can't leave me and let me die aloneDon't tell her you love her
Don’t let her know you insecure
Else yo heart she place it 4
Now yo heart broke she a heart breakerListen you fuckers, you screw-heads
Here is a man who would not take it anymore
A man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit
Here is a man who stood up
Here is—
Easy Mac, yo
Yeeah!
I start wars like Star Wars, I'm the emperor
Waiting with patience in this nation, I'm the predator
And if you hating you'll get served with some metaphors
You in the cypher spittin' shit that you've said before
Your shits regular, I've heard it before
I murder it raw
When it switch it droppin' ya jaw
I'm never stoppin'
I got more options than the quarterback
I'm more than that
I'm dedicated, you just sorta rap
A gram of haze for 25, that's a quarter sack
I gotchu on the half, if you wanna order that
Yeah and it'll cost ya, I'm not a slave
But you can shop and save if you cop an eighth
Watch the block for cops, cops coppin' dro
Call 'em corrupt but they  got a lotta dough
You're monotone, you're actin' like its hard to flow
Homie, you're at fourth down with forty yards to go
I'm a junior but I rap like a veteran
Get more cheddar than anybody that I'm better than
Lemme tell you I spit the shredder
Its sure guaranteed to put the marks in ya sweater
Easy Mac but my mackin' ain't easy
See the rapper, instant satisfaction when you see me
Be the rapper but you lackin' what it takes to be me
And you can find me where the trees be
Cats before ass 'cause I'm out to get rich
Bitches surrounded my dick, I'm countin' my chips
Without it I slip, trip over the foot that they kick
Ain't got cheese for the trees, then don't look at my brick 
The industries infantry, penalties in vanity
The enemy up in the streets, secondaries up in the beef
Chemically I break you down, shots then I take the town
Funeral, I fake the frown
Lay you down and take the crown
Had to take a stand against his castle made in sand
Win the battle with the man, taken apples from a dam
Had to bomb Babylon, the weed you needs in catalog
If you were cream, I had it wrong
Who gives a shits about his mom?
Kickin' competition with the limited edition
And my ambition is I have the proper composition
I deserve the recognition, I'm amazing— definition
Puttin' victims in submission, spittin' each and every sentence 
Too hot like the pot up in ya kitchen
And if you quitcha bitchin' the bitches'll stop snitchin'
I spit it ill, sick like raw chicken
But I'm finger lickin' freestyle king, watch me kill a written
Easy Mac but my mackin' ain't easy
See the rapper, instant satisfaction when you see me
Be the rapper but you lackin' what it takes to be me
And you can find me where the trees be, it's easy
Chyeah!
Easy Mac, homie

Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about
I heard your mans ran cryin' to his mommy and his daddy
When the cops drove by his house, so who you tryin' to dial
If you're lookin' for an answer, you're probably gonna find it now
And to the man in the hat standing lookin' at his watch
Motherfucker, well the time is now
Go clap your hands, let me hear you say, "that's the jam"
See I wouldn't be shit if I ain't have no fans
Can't sit down kids you have to stand
Just put your hands up, you don't have to dance
Here, we get it poppin' like it's Pakistan
Iraq, Iran, and have them sayin' Mac's the man
The maximum, coming through to pass you bums
So if you ain't got no money better ask for some
Hey, we came to get down, have a good time
Bring the champagne out and the good wine
We gon' be sippin' and whippin' the sickest whips
Spittin' the illest shit that's sicker than syphilis
Comin' in the back door yellin' fuck a list
Fans takin' pictures while I'm tryin' to take a piss
We came to party, didn't come to give a shit
Now sing this part, it goes like this
 
All my people in the front
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands
Everybody in the back
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands

Tell the girls it's cool, look but don't touch
I'll be home as soon as I can, I don't rush

I hear these couples fighting all the time, not us
We have a good time, like to get fucked up
What, what, goin' hard tonight
Under 21, but find me at the bar tonight
Hey, driving round in my car tonight
Making music that ain't hard to like, I got the heart to write
A couple bars I might go do
Something crazy or maybe lazy, love me or hate me
You know it's the same me
And it goes a little something like this
 
All my people in the front
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands
Everybody in the back
