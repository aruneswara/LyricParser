You want me to make the time
You always get mad and say what you coulda had
And that you want me to make it right, uh

You always tell me you ain't surprised
You said it's the last time, I guess that you were right
'Cause I'ma do one with you tonight
And now I'm so sick of these love songs, so sad and slow
And I'm so sick of wishin' I had you on my own

And I know you see the pain in my eyes, every secret and lie
Got a reason to cry 'fore I sleep at night
I need my peace of mind, I see you fine
But I'm far from that, so—
Now I'ma be savage, but you made it happen
And you made a habit 
I wonder what happened
I thought we would last 'til we turn into ashes
Burnin' and crashin'
Why can't I get past it? 
Damn, girl, you changed up the best way
I just feel sorry for my next one
'Cause I'ma be selfish, I'm gon' be selfish
And no one can change my mind
No one can help me
Oh, I'm gon' be selfish, I'm gon' be selfish
And no one can change my mind
No one can help me
Oh, I'm gon' be—
Bad, bad, bad
Because I just can't do this again
Don't wanna feel like this again
So she has to
Now I'm up in LA, I'm with a bitch from the Bay
I'm tellin' her that I love her, but my feelings will fade 
Because I'll find another and I'll tell her the same
Knowin' that I don't mean a thing I say 
Now I'ma be savage, but you made it happen

Still got all these problems, I thought money would solve 'em
Blood all on the walls and tears drop down, they fallin'
I don't even wanna think about all that, but it's like I can't help it
You say you can't help me, I gotta help myself but
I need help with that 'cause I feel so helpless
I feel like I've been to Hell and back by myself and
There ain't nothin' in the way no more, only myself is
I'm in the way, I'm in the way of myself

I got nothing to prove, but a whole lot to lose
My mama used to sell drugs to pay for my school
My uncle Dub got knocked, ended up on the news
This all I know, I had to do this, I couldn't pick and choose
I used to pray for some better days
Ten years later, I'm in L.A. whippin' a Bentayga

That I switched up and tell 'em stories that were never true
Shit ain't nothin' new , I'm livin' comfortable
How the fuck are you hating? Just two years ago, I was like you
Ninth grade, dropped out of school, used to sleep on JD's couch

Never did you wrong, never told you nothing wrong, no
I always kept it one hundred from the jump, oh
I always tried to keep it cool, but you were so cold 
There's a lot more to the story that they don't know 
There's a lot more to the story than the photo 
There's a lot more to the story and we both know
But it's okay, I'll be good, no, oh
Long as my money right, I'll be good, no, oh
Long as my bitch fine, I'll be good, oh-oh
Long as the circle tight, then I'm good, on GodJust the other day, shit was all cool
Now I can't catch a break, thinking 'bout you
I promised that I wouldn't, but I ran back to you
'Cause one more night alone, just might not be good for
What got into you? Why you acting brand new for?
And what I ever do? Maybe I just took it too far
I did fall apart, maybe I was a little too much
And now I'm thinking too much, drank a little too much
But I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
And I don't wanna feel how I felt before

But memories live forever
For the worse or for the better
Can't let you go, my heart won't let her
Can't let you go and you know it
Yeah, I put my all in
I gave you whatever
Gave you my heart and you broke it, yeah
You were so selfish, did nothing to help me
And I was so blinded, but I couldn't help it

Mello made it right
I need to pour me up a cup just to feel somethin'
I feel like I been through so much, I don't even feel nothin'
And I know sometimes, it might be hard for you to love me
And even though I may not show it, I need it from you
I thought that I was back on track but I feel lost again
You gotta learn to trust yourself, these people not your friends
Where would they be if I was down at sticks and rocks again?
They only love me 'cause I'm countin' up these knots with them
I know I'm just guap to them
I seen money change my friends, I seen money change these hoes
I see motherfuckers change, 'cause of the shit that I got on
It's like I've been seein' the real ever since I got on
And since I stopped doin' favors, I been in the wrong
I need to pour me up a cup just to feel somethin'
I feel like I been through so much, I don't even feel nothin'
And I know sometimes, it might be hard for you to love me
And even though I may not show it, I need it from you
Oh, I need it, I need it
I need that, oh, I need it all
Oh, I need it, I need it
I need that, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, woah, here I go, tryna fight myself again
It's late as fuck, I'm thinkin' like, "How did I get here again?"
Found myself in tears again with everythin' that I ever feared
I promised that I wouldn't lose myself, but damn it, here I am
I'm in my head constantly, and like right now, I need you right here
I'm in my bed prayin' up to the sky hopin' that God can hear
This shit ain't fair, now that I got bread, I'm 'posed to be happy, yeah
That should be cool, but nothin' is
I need to pour me up a cup just to feel somethin'
I feel like I been through so much, I don't even feel nothin'
And I know sometimes, it might be hard for you to love me
And even though I may not show it, I need it from you

I need that, oh, I need it all

I need that, oh, oh, oh, ohMusic doesn't come from your mind
It comes from your soul
Mm, mm, mm-mm, mm
Oh, oh, oh
I serve my time for all my crimes
Sitting here, feeling so terrified
And no one knows where the answer lies
How you gon' tell me what I gotta live without?
When you don't know half the things that I live without
I highly doubt, that you have the same things holding you down
This is me telling you, you would never understand
Things ain't what they seem from the outside, lookin' in
Unexplainable, unexplainable, unexplainable
Even if you look again
Even if you look again
Even if you look again 
Even if you look again
In the back of my head, there's something haunting
I know it wants me, to end up lonely
I'm searching for my peace, somebody help me
Feels like I'm about to die slowly
Oh, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round in my soul
It's been a couple years still don't feel whole
At least I found home, she's all I know
So I'll be damned if I let her go
This is me telling you, you would never understand
Things ain't what they seem from the outside, lookin' in
Unexplainable, unexplainable, unexplainable
Even if you look again
Even if you look again
Even if you look again 
Even if you look again
You don't know what I need, I need my life
Back to the way that it was
Nowadays, I feel alone
Said I didn't have shit, but I had my friends
Nowadays, I don't really know on what to spend
It's always so wrong in my head
Thinkin' 'bout what I should've said
Could've, would've, should've done it all
In my room with nothing but these walls
The thrill is something I can't control
These demons taking over my soul
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can
This is me telling you, you would never understand
Things ain't what they seem from the outside, lookin' in
Unexplainable, unexplainable, unexplainable
Even if you look again
Even if you look again
Even if you look again 
Even if you look againI got something to confess, I ain't been doin' my best

You shut me down
You lock me out
You do the things I hate about you
At the end of it all, I'm still here
You sit me down and you kick me out
It's like we go up, just to go down
I say I'm out but then somehow, I'm still there
Maybe, it's the way
That you make everything okay
Yeah, you're the one that soothe my pain
But you get too into my bra-a-a-ain
Yeah, I love you, but I hate me
Maybe you're one to change me
You're the one that can save me
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, ohWhat's up?
Where you at? What are you doin'? I miss you

Shout out my boys from the 70
Shout out my boys from the 60, they know what's in me
Shout out my boys from the 17, they really know how I was livin'
Oh, what a feeling
I walk through the city, they treat me like God
We were six deep in that five-seated car
I heard that they got a problem with me
Told 'em, "Come to my face," but they fakin', they fraud
Drive through the hood in Lamborghini cars
I might just give a hunnid to my dawgs 
Thank you for holding it down and I'm sorry if you ever felt like there was love lost 
Now they blamin' ONEFOUR for all of the drillings 
They blamin' us for what happens in Sydney 
They blamin' us for what happens in Melbourne 
They blamin' us for what happens in Brissy 
Tell me who's with me?
'Cause I ain't kidding, this shit's been happenin' since back in the day 
No one said nothing when shh, got knocked
But now everybody's got something to say
Get the fuck out my face 
I ain't tryna lead these youngins astray
But pussio stay in your place 
If you got a problem, then come out and play
I'm makin' my paper, I stayed in my lane
They thought I would change for the money and fame
Everything that I'm doin', I do it for the gang
We already told you, this shit ain't a game
Now stop playin', everyone knows that
I'm like the Jay or the Drake of my city
Fuck what they say, they won't say that shit to me

Shout out my boys from the 70
Shout out my boys from the 60, they know what's in me
Shout out my boys from the 17, they really know how I was livin'
Oh, what a feeling
I've got too much , on my plate to be puttin' up with all the politics 
For the critics, I don't have the tolerance
And for the pussy boys suckin' and swallowin' 
Yeah, they hate when I'm speakin' the truth, but I gotta acknowledge it 
Yeah, they quick to point fingers, but someone please tell me, where did they all get their confidence? 
I ain't gotta take this shit no more
First class and I'm on that plane 
Put Aus' on the map and they all complain 
Tellin' the truth and they still complain 
Now they shootin' clips 'cause they all want fame
But out on the strip, that got no name
I don't give a fuck, I'ma cop that blame
I was raised on the street, I'ma stay this way 
'Cause the things I say, I'ma take to the grave 
Now listen
I'm like the Jay or the Drake of my city
Fuck what they say, they won't say that shit to me

Thank you for holding it down and I'm sorry if you ever felt like there was love lostI'm tryna do it, so
People who are making dope shit can literally do the same as me
But in order to do that, the world needs to open up to Australia first
There's a lot of things in Australia that people have misconceptions about
And I say that breaking those barriers is the key to opening up Australia to the world
Cause it's not all like, Kangaroos and deadly animals and shit
Yeah, Australia needs somebody that
Nah, a group of people that
I guess open up everything for the rest of the people
I've been movin' so damn quickly
I've been getting in my bag, I guess
Ooh, execute the plan all day

Ooh, not until I pass the test
Let me tell you that
I've been movin', I've been movin'
Move
I swear to God I've been on the move
It feel like I'm livin' out a movie
Almost like it's too good to be true
Now I can't lose, no more
Blue ticks in my inbox, silver tick  the hat
Like a dog from the pound boy
I done came from out the back, yeah
Motherfuckin' high stats, I'm on a song with Skies
I'm winnin' in real life
I've been movin' so damn quickly
I've been getting in my bag, I guess
Ooh, execute the plan all day

Ooh, not until I pass the test
Let me tell you that

Shawty lookin' from the side, I'm 'bout the bags, you bitch
Yeah, my doors are suicide, she tried to crash the whip
I'ma motherfuckin' spend it, nigga, look at how I'm livin'
Made it because I'm gifted
I told my momma, "Stop trippin, I'm putting food in the kitchen"
Times I thought I lost it, I asked God for forgiveness
Niggas acting like bitches and we ain't with all the bitchin'!
Yeah, mad 'cause my money long
I'ma make right my wrongs

Ayy, I've been in my pack, yeahYeah, ooh
Yeah, hold on, yeah
Yeah, okay, let me tell it
Okay, yeah
Yeah
All I wanted was respect
Just want to be accepted
Too focused on being perfect
And now that I reflect
I was blind and I shouldn't have listened to what you said
Now there's a disconnect between me and you
Now I'm true to myself and I make my own moves
I used to try and be cool, impress the kids at school
But I wasn't being true to my Goddamn roots
Hol' up
I speak from my heart, not my throat
Said no longer I'd be told
The person I am, still finding myself
I really don't need you to hold me back
No holding me back, no more discussions 'bout that
Boy, it's a wrap
Used to worry about so-called “friends”, but they'd never hit me back
Like damn, look at how far I've come
But I've only just begun
I tried to run from the person that I was
Goddamn, how I was so dumb
But I don't need your judgement
Was somebody I wasn't
But now I'm here to change that
And take over the country, oh man
All I wanted was respect
Just want to be accepted
Too focused on being perfect
And now that I reflect
I was blind and I shouldn't have listened to what you said
Now there's a disconnect between me and you
Now I'm true to myself and I make my own moves
I used to try and be cool, impress the kids at school
But I wasn't being true to my Goddamn roots
Hol' up Have you ever had a dream that you, um, you had, your, you- you could, you’ll do, you- you wants, you, you could do so, you- you’ll do, you could- you, you want, you want them to do you so much you could do anything?
Know your place , know your worth 
They feel a way, they throwin' dirt 
My mama told me you gon' get what you deserve 
So when they're throwin' shade I sit there with a smirk 
I cannot relate to what they're saying 
I could never change and it's always been this way
I'm different, they don't look at me the same 
It was like that since an infant and I take that to my grave, boy
I was lookin' out for way too many 
So I started looking up, hopefully my uncle hear me
Goddamn, just thinkin' 'bout him gets me teary 
'Cause I remember that last conversation that we had so clearly
He said: "Boy you got a dream, so go and make it work
If you listen to them others they gon' put you in the dirt
Yeah they always be watchin', quietly they'll lurk
And I want you to remember this until you're in a hearse"
I said: "Okay, I got a dream, so I'ma make it work
I won't listen to them others, they gon' put me in the dirt
Yeah I know they always watchin', quietly they'll lurk
And I promise I'll remember 'til I'm all up in a hearse", ah yeah
Yeah, now they tryna tag along
I cannot mess with that 'cause they ain't always been around
Couldn't care about  but  to them all
From the studio to the stage, you know that I shut it down, woah
Hold up, wait a minute, just spare me the moment
My uncle told me; "Get it, put your stamp on it and own it" 
And I told him "yeah I get it", at the time I didn't know but
I'm all the way up and to him I kinda owe it
He said: "Boy, you got a dream so go and make it work
If you listen to them others they gon' put you in the dirt
Yeah, they always be watchin', quietly they'll lurk
And I want you to remember this until you're in a hearse"
I said: "Okay, I got a dream, so I'ma make it work
I won't listen to them others, they gon' put me in the dirt

Oh no, oh
You left me bleeding out when I was down
I had to heal myself
Got a lot of friends, but I feel alone
Only one I hear is myself
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Not a single soul I can tell
I look around, I got everything
But I'm still livin' in hell 
Talkin' to the voices in my head
Let 'em tell it, I'd be better dead
Pour a cup of my problems out
And I smoke a zip of my regretsOh, baby
I know you said that you hate me
But after all, I'm the one you call
It's not working how you want it
You know that I'm not being honest
I never meant to hurt you
I'm not perfect, but I know it
Words can't even make up cause I show it
I know you don't see me how you once saw me
I know that it's meaningless to say sorry
You keep on blowing up my phone
I know I'm wrong, I know it
You don't wanna hear my words
You just want me to show it
Oh, baby
I know you said that you hate me
But after all, I'm the one you call
Oh, you can't be serious
You're treating me like a idiot
Oh, shut the fuck up
I ain't hearing it
That's all I hear you say
Oh, you gotta be kidding me
I just want you to be real with me
And why the fuck ain't you here with me?

That don’t change how much I want you
Let me know, let me know, oh
Let me know, let me know, oh
Uh, anywhere you go, you come back
And you call me every name under the sun
Remember times when you always used to say I was the one?
Nowadays all I ever hear you say is "I'm done"
And I know that I can probably do some things better
But I ain't tryna...I still remember
Last December when you told me
You was into me
My head above this water
Can't get into
Think with you, I might drown
Oh, I remember
Oh, I remember
No, no-o-o-o
It's okay, I'll be on my way, I'll be on my way, I'll be on my way 
But in my bed there's an empty space, where you can lay, come through my place 
Keep you warm when you're in my brace, I'll keep you safe, just keep your place 
But for now, I'll be on my way, I'll be on my way, I'll be on my way 
Am I out of line? Through this life, I might test my fists tonight
Am I out of line? Through this lie, with you soarin' through my mind

What I keep on tellin' myself every night, and
I got all these problems, I can never justify them
And I know I need help but I don't ever take the time, and
I keep this shit low, low, low, I keep it on silent
You tell me it's gon' do me harm if I keep it inside, man
I won't ever know, know, know, about how they find me
Overthinking all the time, my mind always crowded
Oh well, I gotta keep it movin'

But fuck it, I don't need no drugs, I'll just be flyin'
Off this Hennessy, maybe you should try it
Lying to myself, yeah, I'm lying to myself
But I don't really care long as in I'm lying in my wealth
Like, how did I get here? No one to blame but myself
But ever since you left, I felt a change in myself, yeah

Sitting at home alone, smoke in my lungs
Thinking about what we could've been and done 
Oh, it was cool while it lasted, a beautiful happening
Sorry I met you, but good that we happened
I learned to lie, just from you
And even though I wish 
Shit went more how I said 
It's time to move on and forget
The past, the past, the past

In the game we don't play, I'm just sayin’

Lately, they all love to hate me 
I feel like they'd do anything just to stop and break me
If you don't got my trust we cannot discuss what I'm making
Look at me in disgust, bitches know that it won't change me
I don't care if you don't feel this 'cause it's just the way I feel
They all making promises, but which of them was real?
Seein' all these rappers going straight in for the kill
If you wanna be successful, then you gonna have to fail, oh yeah
My whole life is changin'
All these people I don't know sayin' they made me

Yeah
No old news, had to glo' up
Just watch, the kid gon' blow up
I've been in it for a minute
Business is the only thing that I'm consumed of
Now I've got a vision planned out
All these rappers in a bad drought
Know I'm the man with the plan now
All you boys in the background 
Used to laugh like it was funny or somethin'
Don't talk to me, you can't tell me nothin'
Rappers do the most, man, they always frontin'
If I buy it too, man, they always bluffin'
So how you feel, how you feel?
Now the kid is trill
Yeah I made my dreams real 
You already know the deal
My whole life is changin'
All these people I don't know sayin' they made me
Here forever, yeah, I'm stayin'
In the game we don't play, I'm just sayin'

-met her 
Hoodie low 'cause I'm 'bout my business
From the bottom of the map
Young boy, I stay winning
Make it work, that's a given
I talk less, do more
See, you boys stay livid
What the fuck do you take me for?
See, money gettin' tall but the boy still small
Shawty call my phone, I decline her calls
They ain't talkin' rollin' papers when they say the boy raw
And I'm all up in New York
With Lil Tecca, he the dawg
We hit your bitch from the back
Now, we make her do the walk
We go, switch, yeah, switch, yeah
Switch, yeah, switch, yeah
And I'm all up in New York
'Bout to get my money long
Oh, yeah, G-Money hit my phone
He said "The label want some"
I said "Switch"-Yo
Yo, what's up, what's up?
Nah, I'm at the studio right now
N-Nah, but I'll give you a call after the session, alright?
Alright, bye
Damn
Isn't it funny how far I came?
Told me my dream was a reach
So I reached for the stars and it since hasn't been the same
And ever since I paved my own lane
They've been looking for directions
And ever since they've tried to clone me
But they don't got the same connection 
Haven't been posting on Instagram
Keep myself secluded from the rest of them
Hitting up my line, they keep pestering
They ask for features, well it just depends
'Bout to be a boss in the business
'Bout to be a cost just to witness
Yeah, you popping now, enjoy it while you can
It'll last for five minutes
I swear
Had this dream all my life, convinced myself to chase it
Now things are starting to happen
And I'm making moves and landing all these placements
Landing in all these new places
Goddamn, it's outrageous
I've been in it for a minute
Tryna get it, I just gotta have patience
Boss up, boss up, the young boy done bossed up
Bossed up, boss up, the young boy done bossed up
Boss up, bossed up, the young boy done bossed up
Boss up, boss up, the young boy done bossed up
Boss up, boss up, the young boy done bossed up
Bossed up, bossed up, the young boy done bossed up
Damn, shit, you know I done bossed up, haha
Yeah, hello

Mum, I'm com-
Mum, I'm coming

Okay, okay
I love you
I love you

Bye, byeI've been scared, I've been here before
I've been scared, I've been here before
I've been scared, I've been here before
I-, I feel like we so disconnected lately
I don't know what changed but it ain't the same these days
We don't see eye to eye no more, like we used to
And I don't know what it is, but
I think the problem is, you don't know how the deal with me
But I don't know how to deal with me either 
See I think the problem is, you don't know how the deal with me
But I don't know how to deal with me either 
Sometimes, I get a little too in my thoughts
Sometimes, I get a little too in my feelings
Sometimes, I get a little too in my thoughts
Sometimes, I write a letter to you through a song
Lately I been thinkin' stupid
I can't do nothing without making excuses
I need some help, need your love, it is proven
To work on my body when no one else will do it, yeah
Love to talk, don't like to do shit, oh shit
I think that I stepped into some new shit, new shit
I think I just stepped into an ocean
The bad bitches, crooks and a bunch of fuckin' cool kids
It's bullshit, the way that it's portrayed
Stepped into the place, I don't even know the name
All I ever wanted was a little bit of fame
Now all I want is my mom and my friends, for real
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
But I, I feel like we so disconnected lately
I don't know what changed but it ain't the same these days
We don't see eye to eye no more, like we used to
And I don't know what it is, but
I think the problem is, you don't know how the deal with me
But I don't know how to deal with me either 
See I think the problem is, you don't know how the deal with me
But I don't know how to deal with me either Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy
I'm bouta go in
I'm bouta go in
They say why you acting funny?
We go way back
Boy you never come to check on me, so no check for you 
Only eating with my brothers, boy there's none left for you
Used to have a heart for you but its got left in two
Now you hissy fitting in my comments, I was expecting you
No, ayy
I'm the only one that can stop me 
The light of day is something you won't  see
And I reside in South Sydney, yeah that's where I'm at
Cashin' government checks, we don't pay no tax
Catching trains to the city, we don't do no tap
Kenny boy keep the flip phone but he don't do trap 
Moving from the country, what a change
Now mama flipping bands just for the change
Hiding my report card for the grades
But now I can't be tamed, when I realise that this world is for the take
Yeah hol' up wait, 
Give me space, give me time
Give my fate, through the lines
Make me great, I'm gon' shine either way, can't deny
The time that I spent, the rhymes that I checked
My drive, my attempts
My trials, my success 
I talk to like I'm grown but I'm a child
Let them take an inch, they took a mile
They try cramp the style
The boy still looking pretty with the smile
Keep it one hundred times three like  oh my god
I'm the only one that can stop me 
The light of day is something you won't see 
All my life I told them you gon' see
Ain't it finally they'll get what I mean

Ah-yeah 
Waking up, blurry vision
Cold sweats, overheat from overhearing
Yeah, conversations that you have with your friends
It's hard to forgive, but even harder to forget, ah-yeah
And everywhere I go you always seem to pop out
In my brain, where you lay, it's on lockdown
Yeah, conversations that I have in my head
It's hard to forgive, but even harder to forget, ah-yeah
Everywhere I go, everything that I do
Reminds me of why I can't forget about you
From the pictures on my phone
To the songs I'm into
Yeah, everywhere I go I can't forget about youLyrics From Snippet
My kindness is both a gift and curse
They was tryna knock me down for tryna make it work
All I'm tryna do is go and get what I deserve
But at least I know the truth is in my heart and that's for certain

Bitches in my DM's that I knew they used to curve me
People I don't know on my Instagram lurkin'
Waiting for me to slip up
And if it wasn't love back then, it ain't love

Trust me when I say it, this ain't nothing against you

Since fuckin' these same hoes, but none give me feelin' from ya
It's like being with them, but I can never think bout you
I really want to be with you, but I can't put myself through that
Huh, again, I trusted a bitch once I cannot do this again
What if you're the one and I mess it up, then lose out again
I don't want to see you leave, I'm refusing, I am
You asking me, "What is the issue?"
Callin' my Uber because I don't wanna be with you

I feel you near, I feel you close
It feels so wrong
It's been some years, still I don't know
Where are you, when and who, where or
When I close my eyes, I see something I don't like
Wake up and I still hate what I've become
I can't believe my-
Blacked out, drunk out, numb mind, dump her
It seems like nothing has changed like I said it would
I know I said that I'll change but I never could
I'm still lonely and fucked up
And I'm gon' be this way right into my love songs
I've never been the same and that's cause I lost one
All that I ever wanted was to be just loved, oh
I'm still lonely and fucked up
And I'm realizing now that I need your love
Shadows around my heart got nobody to trust 
All that I ever wanted was to be just loved

Don't put me through this again
Don't put me through this again
You know, I take you back
Don't put me through this again

The best, caught between my heart and my mind
Depressed, tell me why I smoke more and I
Sleep less, I relieve stress
I don't want to fight that shit above me
Waited up all night for you to call me
Check my phone, it's five in the morning
And you still ain't call
Back here, fucked up, stuck up in my head now
I can't help but wish that you were here now
Drank too much, I'm drowning in my tears now
Don't put me through this again
You know, I take you back
Don't put me through this again
Don't put me through this again
You know, I take you back
Don't put me through this again
Don't put me through this again

You say that you know, but only I know 
All I hear is bad, bad, bad, bad news
I know you know em' too
Bad, bad, bad, bad news
It's all that I hear
Every day a different headline, there’s a new story
I know it's not real, so why do I worry?
I know you fucked yourself and not for me
They change people, why won't you just call me?
Oh well, I'll be the bad guy until I say lies
You can make the best times turn into some bad lies

Put that on my soul, they don't know what I've been through
These hoes used to curve, now I'm the one that they into

Back then we wasn't cool, now you hit me like I miss you
Okay, it's 'cause I got it now
Flooded out the face, I'm on my way

I got some feelings that I won't show you
Keep 'em aside, you won't ever know, yeah
Oh, you want me to open up, no
'Cause I do not know what you gon' do with it whenever we fight
And I know it's got you tweakin', girl it ain't easy for me to have a talk, imma keep it real
Talkin' 'bout you need me, she say "Do you love me?" I say that I do, but I never will 
Okay, let me keep it real, I'ma keep it a hunnid
I ain't gon' lie, that it ain't just you, there's a whole lotta others
And since you prolly know some of them', they on Gucci and Prada
And oh my God, I can't stop thinking this is somebody's daughter
The way she bust it for the team, bust it for the team
If she don't do it for the 'gram, she gon' bust it off a bean
God damn, sellin' shit is something I ain't never seen
Something off a movie scene, I'm too focused on the green
To be worried 'bout the next bitchMurda on the beat so its not nice!
Oh my god, I wish I could escape from what's
On my mind, I could run but I can’t hide it
All this time, I have just watched it slip past my eye
All my life, all my life, all my life, all my life

I feel like that I want to see, but I can't control inside of me
Anxiety, the reason why I can't sleep I-
Wake up every night and I can’t breathe I-
Know that I'm not perfect, I don't deserve it
In this last year, I feel like I became a different person
I brought up shit in the past, now it's coming back to hurt me
I hope for the best but I'm preparing for the worst things
Uh, I know who I am and where I'm from 
But I'm still trying to find where I belong
Lately, I've been feeling really lost 
Just tryna find my way back home
Oh my god, I wish I could escape from what’s
On my mind, I could run but I can’t hide it
All this time, I have just watched it slip past my eye
All my life, all my life, all my life, all my life

Now I can't catch a break, thinking 'bout you
I promised that I wouldn't, but I ran back to you
'Cause one more night alone, just might not be good for
What got into you? Why you acting brand new for?
And what I ever do? Maybe I just took it too far
I did fall apart, maybe I was a little too much
And now I'm thinking too much, drank a little too much
But I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
And I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
'Cause it's all a little too much, and I'm in need of your love
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
You used to say it was forever, I remember
Tryna' forget, I can't forget ya
Still got your makeup on my sweater
And I know that it's all over
But memories live forever
For the worse or for the better
Can't let you go, my heart won't let her
Can't let you go and you know it
Yeah, I put my all in
I gave you whatever
Gave you my heart and you broke it, yeah
You were so selfish, did nothing to help me
And I was so blinded, but I couldn't help it
But I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
And I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
'Cause it's all a little too much, and I'm in need of your love

Got 'em straight out of stray, bitch you know the fives
And she tell me she love me, I'm one of a kind
The best didn't come out even in my prime
Shawty be on or shawty be slime

I get fucked up and start to wish that it was just us 
Still got trust issues from way back, yeah 
I wish you would hear me to make  
I don't want love, I wanna make bands
I need your company girl and it takes a lot to say that, but I need to say that to you, no
You say that its toxic, its so unhealthy

You gotta show me that you love me girl and not tell me
Yeah I got all this money but I still feel emptyLyrics from Snippet
Better with you today

Summer flooding, can't find love in Hollywood, as I learned that lesson
I might have a better shot gettin' back all my exes from Texas
Send her a message, only when I'm drunk, shit is pathetic
Keep on playin' with her hearth, knowing I'm not ready
For that relationship shit, I'm just tryna get this money
Before I had it, I know that none of these bitches love me
Now Katy text me every night, talkin' about, "come and fuck me"
And she keep on saying she put no one above me 
Yeah, aight

Shawty I'm a dog, put that on god, time for cover
Starting to feel in love, so I might decide to cut her
Ridin' around my whole city listening to the cutter
I will never learn, I just keep on gettin' caught up
I will never change, never switch up on my brothers
They've been there from the start, ever since the boy had nothin'
That's why I tell them come and get these racks up by the dozen
That's why shawty in love so you know I can not trust her
Loyalty and love is lost, nowadays our eyes are crossed
Yeah, they doubt us 'til they brace us, was never down in the mud
Yeah, I told them to be patient but they never listen once
Yeah, they was chasin' fun but I was just chasin' funds

Is she aware, that actually I don't care about my hair
All I see, she just see all the dollar signs in her head
Trap bands all the time, but we never had a dime
Used to fuck with her arrest, now  let me come inside

You be acting funny like your mantra I don't trust it

 rest in peace so  almost everyday lookin' like a 
Now it's time to be the man
 like Peter Pan
I  face my fears
I be on my childhood dreams, dreams, dreams 
I be on my childhood dreams, dreams, dreams 
I be on my childhood dreams, dreams, dreams 
I be on my childhood dreams, dreams, dreams Lyrics from Snippet
... weekend
I'm the best  we won't be friends
Think I got my mind, I'm from the deep end
Shawty got me fucked up, got me tweakin'
I be out my mind sometimes{Припев: The Kid LAROI]
Не могу играть эту песню - она напоминает мне о тебе
Не могу смотреть это шоу - оно напоминает мне о тебе
Не могу ходить туда - это напоминает мне о тебе
Не хочу это делать - это напоминает мне о тебе
Прекратил общение со всеми своими друзьями, потому что они напоминают мне о тебе
Опять не могу напиться - это напоминает мне о тебе
Всё и везде напоминает мне о тебе
Я знаю мы никогда не сможем снова быть вместе
Ты сказала мне, что это навсегда, но я не знал, что "навсегда" может закончиться
Ты заставила меня облажаться, заставила меня думать: "Я умру здесь для тебя"
Чёрт, ты меня обманула, не могу поверить, что я был ослеплён тобой
Но я не хочу плакать
Кладу палец на спусковой крючок и подумываю об убийстве
Я чувствую, что мог бы умереть
Может, если это всё закончится, я смогу быть с тобой в другой жизни
Не могу играть эту песню - она напоминает мне о тебе
Не могу смотреть это шоу - оно напоминает мне о тебе
Не могу ходить туда - это напоминает мне о тебе
Не хочу это делать - это напоминает мне о тебе
Прекратил общение со всеми своими друзьями, потому что они напоминают мне о тебе
Опять не могу напиться - это напоминает мне о тебе
Всё и везде напоминает мне о тебе
Должен выйти и немного подышать свежим воздухом
Я был в клубе и видел как ты пришла со своим временным парнем
Напомни-ка мне ещё раз: кто кого выгнал из чьего дома?
Напомни-ка мне ещё раз: кто сейчас на кого чертовски зол? 
Борюсь за своё сердце и, детка, я никогда не проигрываю
Нет, не могу закинуться снова, потому что это напоминает мне о тебе
Если ты когда-либо нуждалась во мне, я летел к тебе
Говорил тебе, что люблю тебя, детка, я не врал тебе
Борюсь за своё сердце и, детка, я никогда не проигрываю
Нет, не могу закинуться снова, потому что это напоминает мне о тебе
Если ты когда-либо нуждалась во мне, я летел к тебе
Говорил тебе, что люблю тебя, детка, я не врал тебе
Не могу играть эту песню - она напоминает мне о тебе
Не могу смотреть это шоу - оно напоминает мне о тебе
Не могу ходить туда - это напоминает мне о тебе
Не хочу это делать - это напоминает мне о тебе
Прекратил общение со всеми своими друзьями, потому что они напоминают мне о тебе
Опять не могу напиться - это напоминает мне о тебе
Всё и везде напоминает мне о тебеNowadays my friends treat me like strangers
They the same ones that say the money gon' change ya
Funny how money came now they all changed up

Getting kinda late now
I should probably go home
I got way too lit last night
Still ended up on my own
I was with KD last night
Thats why I didn't pick up your call
You said that you need some time
You said you need time alone
 my ex
Tell her you're the best for real
Wake up in the 
Like why the fuck I text her that?
She didn't even text me back
My new bitch just texted me
She wanna go to the club
, but I get checks for thatI'm still tryna get you out of my head
And I know I can not take back what I said
I heard you talking about me to yo' friends
And you gon' tell 'em you don't ever wanna see me again
I'm still tryna get you out of my head
And ...Lyrics from snippet
Okay hol' up,  that bitch is smoking, what's the hold up?
Your love, don't really mean nothing to me no more...
Poe' up, I be in my feelings, I be on one
Hennessy, memories is one hell of a drug
I got somebody else but she don't do what you do
And every time I hold her I wish I was holdin' you
Why you acting brand new
I just want the old you
Yeah my new bitch already fighting it feels like old newsLyrics from Snippet
And I'm still getting too fucked up
That's  to my past, I just want to feel numb
Livin' life outside of my body, want to feel somethin'
But I can't feel, none
Always said that I wanna go back to better days
But in reality, there was no better days
Is it everything that I ever asked forYou told me "come over" cause you miss me
Girl, I don't wanna' fight, I want to fix things 
Why you acting like this shit ain't misty
Girl, why you walking away, I want you with me 
Doing what I'm 'posed to
Why you acting brand new
Girl I want the old you
All these hoes in my DM's, but somehow I chose you
I can tell that something's wrong, girl, you know I know you
Damn, who would've thought
Gucci and Chanel, yeah that's all that she want
Why the fuck am I surprised, I done been here before
How the fuck could you look in my eyes and tell me you love me
Devil in the sky, now I see what you want, bitch
And I know that you lie, but it's what I want to hear
I have to pay thе price, for whatever comеs with it
Fuck it I'm done with it, girl I don't care anymore 
You told me "come over" cause you miss me
Girl, I don't wanna' fight, I want to fix things 
Why you acting like this shit ain't misty
Girl, why you walking away, I want you with me 
Doing what I'm 'posed to
Why you acting brand new
Girl I want the old you
All these hoes in my DM's, but somehow I chose you
I can tell that something's wrong, girl, you know I know youKatie Henderson, 24kgoldn, FaZe Adapt, Haan, and others: "Surprise!"

Said I wouldn't drink, but I did the same day
Shit, I lied to your face like I always do
Said I was gon' change, both know that I can't
Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always doUNAVAILABLEShit 
You know it, don't give me shit when I'm 
Tell me why, tell me why
It's so hard to say goodbye, shit
Tell me why, tell me why
 yeah
Oh shit, let's go 
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit
And when I get inside of my mind, I lose my time
Thinking 'bout the times we had, thinking 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left whеn you told me this was forever and
Tеll me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit
Lost too many people to this shit, can't even speak upon this shit
I seen shit, I'm way too damn young, it shouldn't need to be like this
I swear that I'm way too damn numb to even think about this shit
But when it's late and I lay awake, I get to tweakin' in this bitch
Overthinkin', overdrinkin' Hennessy up in this bitch
And I'ma face another 'Wood 'til I can't think up in this bitch
'Cause if I keep thinking 'bout our memories
Then it's gon' be in memory of me
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit
And when I get inside of my mind I lose my time
Thinking 'bout the times we had, thinking 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit
I can't count all the tears I cried, so many sleepless nights
Watched all of my idols die, right in front of my eyes
She asked why my heart so cold, and I just can't even lie
I think that I'm better off without you with me tonight
Better off alone, 'cause I won't take it well if
You come in my life just to go like the rest did
Why the fuck does God keep testing me?
Put my mind to bed, let it rest in peace
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit
And when I get inside of my mind I lose my time
Thinking 'bout the times we had, thinking 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit
And when I get inside of my mind I lose my time
Thinking 'bout the times we had, thinking 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit
