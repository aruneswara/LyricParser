In a Benz switching lanes
Bad bitch wet like rain
Depressed but I'm lit I'm feeling like Coldy

Walk around town with the heat 
Money plugged in with a beep with a beep
She freaky, she fuck up the sheets 
I'm shoppin’, don't need a receipt
Pablo skrt off in a Ghost 
Rockin' Off-White like the Pope 
Double cup, I pour a four 
We fuckin’ but she gotta go 
Money plug with the guns
That's a Draco, truckload with the tons
She tryna ride on me, hit it from the back
She gon' name me Barry Bonds
Came up from the crumbs
Used to be on the corner black hoodie like Trayvon
Learned from a wisе man, you ain't doin' it right
If you ain't gettin' nothin' to hate on
Finna take hеr out with the Rollie Day-Date on
I put the Louis on like I’m Farrakhan
Mashin’ the gas, I'm swervin’
I pull up to the trap and went to the churches
I ain't checkin' what I paid for my purchase
My niggas apes and bears, this a circus
Money, power, respect, you gotta deserve it
Thankin' Allah that I made it for service
Surgery on her body, got it perfect
Pull up in foreign back to back, they plural
Flower set diamonds in rolls, no floral
She on her period, I need the oral
The key for nothing, they ain’t got no morals
I just want more jewelry, don't want more 
I'm shittin' on niggas, my foreign guts in 
Walk around town with the heat 
Money plugged in with a beep with a beep
She freaky, she fuck up the sheets 
I'm shoppin', don't need a receipt
Pablo skrt off in a Ghost 
Rockin' Off-White like the Pope 
Double cup, I pour a four 
We fuckin' but she gotta go 
Walk around town with the heat 
Money plugged in with a beep with a beep
She freaky, she fuck up the sheets 
I'm shoppin', don't need a receipt
Pablo skrt off in a Ghost 
Rockin' Off-White like the Pope 
Double cup, I pour a four 
We fuckin' but she gotta go Lyrics from Snippets
Niggas ain't thuggin' like that
You sound like a bitch, nigga

I don't wanna pic nigga 
Could you get off my dick nigga 
And I'm fucking your hoLyrics from snippet

Yeah  you still gon' get whacked
No rap cap, really speaking all facts
I'm in the back with a MAC-10
I'm in the O and I'm servin' Xans
I get the dough like the breadman
Pour up, leaning like a kickstandRonRonDoThatShit
Pull up on a bitch like skrt 
Sippin' on purp, , leave a pussy nigga on a shirt
Make that hoe do what I want, roll up my blunt
Cookie smoke all in my lungs
Pull up on a bitch like skrt 
Sippin' on purp, , leave a pussy nigga on a shirt
Make that hoe do what I want, roll up my blunt
Cookie smoke all in my lungs
Pull up on a bitch like skrt 
Fly like a bird, countin' up bands like a nerd
Bitch better have my fee, leave it to me 
Leave a broke bitch in the streets
Who trippin'? I'm trippin', this 45 is rippin'
You heard 'em, put that on yo pimpin'
I got some goons and they ready, two Glocks no machetes
I'm bustin', reloadin', I'm ready
You get no fetti, I'm in the club like I'm Betty 
Racks on my stove, it's too heavy
It ain't no tellin', fuck with a felon
Cops try to get me, I'm bailin'
Pull up on a bitch like skrt 
Sippin' on purp, , leave a pussy nigga on a shirt
Make that hoe do what I want, roll up my blunt
Cookie smoke all in my lungs

        Lyrics from Snippets
Earl on the beat
Stick in the trunk 
I got a stick in the trunk 
Ride wit' a pump 
Came wit' a shawty, I ride wit' a pump 
Say that it's up 
I call my hittas, and we pullin' up 
I get 'em jumped 
Came with the opps and then you gettin' stung
We ain't lackin' bitch what do you mean 
Every one of my niggas on go 
Spent ten thousand just sippin' on lean 
Smokin' weed, gettin' head 
Ridin' 'round, gettin' bread
Still runnin' from the feds
Don't care what you said
Cause we're still gettin' paidIt's a real BI party, NIGGAS, you ain't invited 
Heard some niggas mad, I just got excited 
Heard some bitches dissed me, bet nobody liked it 
I think your music just like your pussy, bitch, nobody buys it, tried it
Charged the nigga like he got indicted 
If he need a feature , I won't even write it 
I do this shit effortlessly, I'm high as bitch, I'm kited
And if you wanna impress me, suck my dick, don't bite it
And if you think you tough, stupid bitch, I'ma show you 
Beat your ass like your OG was 'posed to 
I just got some head, say, "Nigga, what that nose do?" 
You be tweakin' on the net, I will expose you 
Bitch, I've been takin'niggas  bitches niggas with the gang 
I used to fuck his  baby mamma in that Range 
Before I was rappin', I was hittin' stains 
Your bitch is a duck, I got aim 
Ayy, I don't give no fuck 'bout no fame 
Ayy, all these hoes lame, I'm insane 
I don't need no friends, I don't hang hang 
Fuck you and your mans, I don't gang bang 
I love all my bitches, we the same thing 
All my bitches, make it rain gang 
What you wanna do, nigga? Pain gang 
Bro'll pop a nigga like some champagne 
It's a real bi  party, bitch, you ain't invited 
Heard some niggas  mad, I just got excited 
Heard some bitches dissed me, bet nobody liked it 
I think your music just like your pussy ass , bitch, nobody buys it, tried it
Charged the nigga like he got indicted 
If he need a feature , I won't even write it 
I do this shit effortlessly, I'm high as fuck, I'm kited 
And if you wanna impress me, suck my dick, don't bite it
And if you think you tough, stupid bitch, I'ma show you 
Beat your ass like your OG was 'posed to
I just got some head, say, "Nigga, what that nose do?" 
You be tweakin' on the net, I will expose you 
I just took yo bitch what you gon' do?
He say I got some better cat and I'm so cool
But bitch, I don't want that nigga, I don't know rules 
We be fuckin' to my music and some old school 
Bitch, you ain't know, I'ma hold to it 
Pussy wet as fuck I'm a whole pool 
Beat, beat the dick up, he got pro tools 
Turn a thug to a slut, bitch, you're old news 
Bitch if I tell your nigga slide, he gon' come 
She  gon' suck up on this dick like some gum 
Bitches goin' out sad, bitches dumb 
Bitches ain't on shit, bitches ain't on a crumb, bitch
D
