I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead 
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache 
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache 
You made my heart break 
You made my heart ache 
You made my heart break again 
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
Easier said than done, I thought you were—
—instead of my head
You found another— better one
I won't let you forget meMhm, they're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same
I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh, no, you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in 
Tell me, what's the secret to love? I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'
Hey, these girls are insane, yeah, uh
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change before I go insane, love
Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh, no, she didn't
Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow
Fuck givin', I'ma take, not borrow
And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind
I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?
It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'
Ah
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, loveMm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, uh
I can't breathe , I can't breathe, 999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Ring-ring, phone call from depression
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line, I talk to addiction, huh
Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them
This can't be real, is it fiction?
Somethin' feels broke, need to fix it
I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Let's be for real
If it wasn't for the pills, I wouldn't be here
But if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah
I just told y'all my secret, yeah
It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill

Ain't nobody else saying shit
Daytrip took it to ten 
I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet

All legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh
Dying young, uh, demon youth
What's the 27 Club? We ain't making it past 21

'Cause all the legends seem to die out, what the fuck is this 'bout?
I'm tryna make it out, I'm tryna change the world
I'm tryna take her out, I'm tryna take your girl
More importantly, I'm tryna change the world
Maybe flex with some diamonds and pearls, yeah
I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet 
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh
Dying young, uh, demon youth
My mind is foggy, I'm so confused
We keep on losing our legends to
The cruel cold world, what is it coming to?
The end of the world, is it coming soon?
Now, ooh, ooh, oh
That hit's for you
I usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet 
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected

She told me put my heart in the bag 
And nobody gets hurt 
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast 
So I'm making it worse 
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person 
It's a gift and a curse 
But I cannot reverse it
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, "You loved me first" 
One thing my dad told me was, "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
"Flex on a ho every time they're insecure"
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? 
Is your love really true?
She told me put my heart in the bag 
And nobody gets hurt 
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast 
So I'm making it worse 
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past 
I'm a whole different person 
It's a gift and a curse 
But I cannot reverse it
You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you
She told me put my heart in the bag 
And nobody gets hurt 
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast

"I don't want the money, I just want the molly"
That's what she say when she lived in the Valley
Lil' boy, I'm your father, hakuna matata
I made that girl give all of that top up
Got dreads in my head, used to pray for the lock up

Not just somebody
No, no
Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody
That made promises to give you the world? Um
I really hope they held you down
I really hope it was no lying
'Cause when heart breaks it feel like the world's gone
But if the love's real, you'd feel your soul roar like a lion
And you'd finally let bygones be bygones
Don't throw in the towel, I know it feels like you're the only one trying
You just gotta learn to live and love on
I belong with the one put on this Earth for me
Everybody has their someone, just gotta look and see
I'm screaming out, "Lord, help me, I've been lonely"
That's when you accept me, then you set me free
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Uh, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love didn't click
Searchin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Yeah, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love ain't click
Lookin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Been pretty fuckin' bad, but it's better now
Through the trials and tribulations, I found my way out
Feel all of the good and bad vibrations all around
All around us, they surround us
Was a lost cause with some lost love
It ain't my fault, pain chose us
Then I found her
My whole world turned upside down, uh
But for the better
I belong with the one put on this Earth for me
Everybody has their someone, just gotta look and see
I'm screaming out, "Lord, help me, I've been lonely"
That's when you accept me, then you set me free
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Uh, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love didn't click
Searchin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Yeah, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love ain't click
Lookin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Thank God I finally found you
You put the light in my eyes when I'm around you
I'm too flawed to hold you down, but
Don't wanna be here alone
And I thank God I finally found you
I'll put the light in your eyes if I'm allowed to
I'm too flawed to hold you down, but
Don't let me be here aloneFrom the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh

Tell me that I'm strung out, wasted on the daily
Prolly 'cause there's no one around me numbin' all my pain
Prolly 'cause there's no umbrella to shield me from all the rain
Probably because you're the one playin' the mind games
You hate me because I don't let you play no mind games
They give me migraines and damage my brain
Date me, break me, easily replace me

I'ma take a trip to the past off the shrooms, off the acid
Then I'll fuck a bad bitch
Uh, ayy, call me Young Savage
But I'm ballin' like a young Maverick
This heartbreak music is such a passion
I thought I left it inside the past-tense
You gave me your heart, it was made of plastic
No father-havin', I'm a bastard
At least I'm a rich one
You need a real nigga, you should go get one
So many hoes in my face, I could pick one
Make her pop it like a zit, huh

Is a lost soul, rich and blind
I know I have a purpose, but I don't see the purpose
They tell me the death of me gon' be the Perkys
I know they laced pills, I bought them on purpose
Life's unreal when death's uncertain
It's funny how the blessed ones had the most curses
Heart falling to the floor if we lose another person
Take three more, I swear it's worth it
But it ain't no world tour if I'm laying in a hearse
I remember losing lil' bro, he laying in the dirt
Now I'm bound to drop a tear or two on every single verse
Good terms, bad terms, when they die, it's the worst

They can have a penny 'cause I don't really got a dime for it
Catch me rockin' Tom Ford and some Air Forces
With a passport and a black torch

Put an arrow through yo heart, but no, I'm not Cupid
Make you shuffle when I shoot, but no, it's not Cupid
The wordplay is so cold, my heart is so gone
Yo bitch is so sprung, yeah, I put the team on
She gon' give the whole team head, call that a crew neck
But I'm wearin' a sweater, I'ma get her wetter, uh

If you run up, you'll, you'll get cranked like Soulja did
I'ma drop bars same way I drop bombs
You ain't on shit, WW-dot-com

Eeny meeny miney moe, I always pick the choosers out
She got titties, when she come around I pick the hooters out
Run up on me, that's okay, they beefin' on computers now?
I'm not worried about these niggas, keep a .30 on my hip
I Steph Curry about these niggas
These niggas hella soft, man I worry about these niggas
I never run away, I don't flurry away from niggas
That nigga lil' pussy, he furry, ain't he, lil' nigga?
Pull up on the scene, you know I'm with it
My windows tinted, pulled up clean with a "Stop, you're finished"
You know we dig it
I'm ballin' like Dennis Rodman, I'm fuckin' awesome
I'm bombin' like atomic, my eyes are redder than demonic
I'm faster than sonic, I'm faster, withdrawals got me fastin'
My stomach movin' slow like molasses
I got it, run up on me, I'm poppin'
Feel like Drake when I'm rappin' 'cause I start from the bottom
All this shit that I'm talkin', I could probably back it up
I slide into yo bitch DM like a sled and toboggan
For your brains I may bargain, I caught you lackin' at Target
I'll turn yo ass to a target then threw yo ass in the garbage
Run up on me, it's nothing, I swear to god that I'm bussin'
Like a Proactiv commercial or somethin', haha
These niggas makin' assumption, me, I'm just makin' this money, huh
I wear Givenchy, you still in Abercrombie, you see the difference?
Broke niggas and rich niggas, showin' the distance
This is a business relationship, fuck a friendship
All these other niggas fake like, "What you got over there?
Let me get something off your plate," nah
I did this by myself so I don't need nobody help
Shit, I'm a giant, you an elf, I put yo brains up on a shelf after I collect it
Matter of fact, my mind is my weapon
Slide through yo block again and catch some sloppy seconds
That's a preference, I heard you like talkin' about heaven
Well I send yo ass to hell, right next to Jezebel, uh, huh
You can catch twenty shells, you a fat pussy, you get shot, Garfield
I got bars like jail barbells, these niggas not funny, huh, Seinfeld, aha
But my flow is so unpredictable
Fuckin' with me is like steppin' in a minefield
Man, I could never mess up, I gotta fess up, this is a confession
I pull up on the scene with my .40, it came from my plaster
That shit's a blessing, huh, I leave you in the past tense
I wrap the rap in plastics, that's just some plaster rap
But I'm still the realest rapper after the fact, huh, can you imagine that?
Man, these niggas sick to hell, Johnson couldn't magic that
Man, this rappin' shit is such a passion
Not a father when I did it so I'm callin' me a bastard
And these niggas talkin' dumb to me
But that shit doesn't matter, 'cause my pockets gettin' fatter
And I'm climbin' like a ladder, outer space, I'm up on Saturn
With some niggas that came from my hometown
They really rowdy, you run up, that's okay
I swear to God we get to growlin' and bouncin' and pouncin'
You gon' need a bouncer, we robbin' yo accountant for everything
So much money that I ain't even count yet
Life's a bitch, why is mine keep playin' farfetched
These niggas ain't locked up, haven't seen bars yet
My gun singin' like Barbra, guess, Streisand
I got a knife in my right hand, your bitch in my left hand
Her meth in my back pocket, I'll give it to her in a second
If she keep jockin', I'll rip your eyes out of your head
If you keep watchin', I am the best rapper in here
The best rapper over there, the best rapper everywhere
I can say what I want and it come out how I want it
Run up if you want, that's okay 'cause it's over
I really do not condone it, I don't fuck with opponents
It's commas, no exponents, but these bullets come in three
And they singin' like Jonas, I don't really got no smoke
But if you want it I got it, I pull it out and I pop it
I send some shots at your noggin, I remember rockin' Robins
Back at the bottom, now it's Givenchy and Gucci
All over my pair of pockets, man, maybe I should stop it
Let's keep goin' man, I'm just feelin' nauseous
Off the Henny, that's the remedy
A hundred in these clips, so if I shoot it that's a centipede
I stick it on the Lamborghini, drivin' like a century
It's 21 inside this clip, like the century, I'm schoolin' niggas
Ruler and the Glock, elementary, I'm in her mouth like a dentist
She made me replenish, I'm ballin' like I'm Dennis
Rodman, rotten, plottin', freestyle, no jottin', I got it
Man I could rap forever, if I go broke Westwood I'ma trap forever
So cold I could go to Siberia and trap the weather
I could trap in Siberia, I could trap wherever
Man, rainy weather, sunny weather, either way, it goes
My gun with me 'cause let's go, ooh
Next beat, next beat, I may come back, ahahaha
Next part, what should I kill? Cool, uh, uh-huh, yeah, uh
Catch me spittin' on this Kill beat
Hopin' that these niggas would just feel me, the real me
My weapon is concealed and
You know I'm a suspect when I walk into the building
I came to London just to make some noise
The shit I say is for grown men, these bars are not for lil' boys
I'm Andy with these toys
You run up on me, you get flexed on like Terry Crews and steroids
Listen, I been ballin' like a Piston

Yeah, that's the shit that I'm on, you ain't on shit 'cause you dumb
You run up on me, you gone, that choppa on me, it's rung
You get hung like a noose
I'm about the war, give a fuck about the truce
All about myself, I give a fuck about you
Matter of fact, I may just shoot the fuck up out you
Put an X next to your name like Malcolm
I guess you didn't weigh your options out, your outcomes
You did the wrong shit on the right day
We turn a white day into a red day

Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first
I've been through the wringer
Tryna put a diamond ring on her finger
She love drama, she be watching Jerry Springer
Next thing you know, we all on Jerry Springer
I play love games, but no, I'm not a cheater
She hate it when I sip codeine, I'm a leaner
The devil on my shoulder keep on telling me to keep her
Should I take her out or should I take her to the cleaner?
Love don't end good for me, no good for me
She's good for me, too good
These hoes love playing me, heartbreaking me
Don't pray for me, just give me drugs 
Just give me drugs
Just bring me drugs
Just give me drugs
Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first
I told her, "Run around and get away"
I think I need a getaway
I need to call a timeout, I need to set another play
I need a umbrella 'cause every day feel like a rainy day
I need something other than Xannies to take the pain away
I ran away to California, I'm tryna cut corners
Satan bossin' me around, but you know I don't take orders
Yeah, I had to move around, I was startin' to feel cornered
Startin' to feel cornered, I can't see the front door
Startin' to feel cornered, startin' to feel slaughtered
Started to not give a fuck, screamin' out, "Why bother?"
My ex-bitch too bad, my next bitch way hotter
We met in a car crash, she ride it like full throttle
Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you firstDY definitely Krazy
Abandon all ships, it's about to go down
No Titanic 
There's a lot going on in my head right now
But I manage

Both hands in the air as I scream out prayers
My demons show their face in the midnight air

Midnight air , surrounded in the midnight air
I'ma drown in here, no Titanic, TitanicEnviyon on the mix

You fightin' through a text using all caps
Fuck this, screw that, you sayin' to send you back home
Well, baby girl, I don't want to do that
It's true that you the only home I know
Without you, all it ever does is snow
My voice too deep for a average ho
Babe, welcome to my world, dark and confusin'
Get lost in it often, the same way I'm lost in you
And it's often my mind that I'm losin'
See, half of it's stuck in a pill bottle, high and confused
Don't even know what the fuck I be doin'
Pray every day that I'm far from a nuisance
Tryna figure out how to live with the blueprints

I never got why niggas hate
It's probably 'cause I'm doin' better than them, anyway
It's probably 'cause I get they bitches wetter, anyway
It's probably 'cause I'm livin' and they're in a lower place
They're walkin' in their sorrows, while I'm vibin' out in space
Crash land just to take they girl on a dinner date
When haters see me winnin' they just hyperventilate
They always try to stop me, but I never hesitate
Just follow all your dreams and when you reach them, celebrate

Road trip on me, it'll be fun, you'll see
But you don't gotta sit in the trunk, you can sit next to me
Me and Stan, we alike, but he ain't nicer than me
He was drunk drivin', me, I'm just straight Perc-ules

Not afraid to die, as you can see
Life isn't real, love's make believe

Up, up and away, hop in
Feel the walls in my brain and they're caving in
Outside those walls, there's a ocean, I can't swim
Especially with all these waves
I'm walkin' in Prada, tryna solve my problems
Through the night, finding vibes, Moonlight Sonata
I try to deny, but you see the pills in my eyes
I tell her that I'm high, but she don't seem surprised
Walkin' in Prada, tryna solve my problems
Through the night, finding vibes, Moonlight Sonata
I try to deny, but you see the pills in my eyes
I tell her that I'm high, but she don't seem surprised 
Maybe I realize that my life is a ride
Buckle up, hold tight, take a left, turn right
GPS don't work, can't see at night
So it's getting hard to drive, anxiety at a stoplight
Hard to think, easy to cry, that's how I know something's not right
Numb the pain with fun times, supermotos, Perc lines
Remember that one time everything was alright
Alright 
Up, up and away, hop in
Feel the walls in my brain and they're caving in
Outside those walls, there's a ocean, I can't swim
Especially with all these waves
I'm walkin' in Prada, tryna solve my problems
Through the night, finding vibes, Moonlight Sonata
I try to deny, but you see the pills in my eyes
I tell her that I'm high, but she don't seem surprised
Walkin' in Prada, tryna solve my problems
Through the night, finding vibes, Moonlight Sonata
I try to deny, but you see the pills in my eyes
I tell her that I'm high, but she don't seem surprised

Feel the walls in my brain and they're caving in
Outside those walls, there's a ocean, I can't swim
Especially with all these wavesNeed a drink? 
Found my home 
She make me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine...
Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it
There's love at my front door, short notice
She not like the sane girls, I noticed
Think I met my soulmate, yeah, I know it
When it gets dark outside, in you I confide
You help me face my demons, I won't hide, hide
Girls like you are hard to find
I hope you don't mind, if I give you the time of your life, life, life
Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it
Life is not the same with your pictures in my frame
Now that you're here, I want nothing to change
You pick me up when I'm down, I need you around
You seen me through my darkest times
Girl, is there something that you try to find?
You brought meaning to my life
All because of you, I do right

Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home
She made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine with it
She really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls, but we're fine with itStuck in a maze
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Stuck in a maze, mmh
Stuck in a maze
Everything's okay but it's not really okay
My life's a death race
I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain
I'm going insane
Life's not the same
Stuck in a maze
I'm not going in
My brain is going everywhere
I'm tormented every day
Mama, I'm losing my mental
The sorrows that I've been through
Story to be continued
I sip ill, pop pills, crack seals
Doing anything to numb the weight that I feel, yeah
I chase thrills, you still crashin' Hot Wheels
Ride a dirt bike down the ditch, see if I live
I'm not in my subconscious, I'm conscious
They tell me that they can help me, I got this
Watch this, I took my demons into the bank of life and I made the biggest deposit
Without drugs, I'm losing my logic
These pills and my Pro Tools still got logic
I run, I run, I run
I run, I run, I run
Stuck in a maze
Everything's okay but it's not really okay
My life's a death race
I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain
I'm going insane
Life's not the same
Stuck in a maze
I'm not going in
My brain is going everywhere
I'm tormented every day
Mama, I'm losing my mental
The sorrows that I've been through
Story to be continuedOh-oh-oh, woah, woah
It's fire
Huh, as we go on, we remember
All the times we spent together 
As our lives change , from whatever
We will still be , friends forever
First off, tell the girl in my math class I'm rich
And you broke, bitch, I had the last laugh
And to the dumb nigga in my science lab
How'd it feel when we fought and you caught a jab?
Man, fuck prom, fuck the teacher that was always talkin' on the intercom
And fuck the student that we thought was always gon' bring in a bomb
And all of the girls wild, them bitches was too foul
They all on my dick now
Huh, as we go on , we remember 
All the times we , spent together 
As our lives change , from whatever
We will still be , friends forever
Um, information leaker, had a crush on one of my teachers
Used to fantasize makin' love with her behind the bleachers
And to all the people who ain't like me, I ain't like me either
Half my class was havin' kids, guess we had that jungle fever
Uh, I was waitin' for my graduation , growin' impatient 
What I didn't know was this grown-up world 
Was just school in a blown-up world 
There's still gossip, there's still drama, there's still problems
There's a right and there's a wrong
There's still people that I think won't love me 'til I'm gone
Low-key miss the days walkin' 'round in my school halls
But now I got a bigger job, the world screamin' my songs
Huh, as we go on , we remember 
All the times we , spent together 
As our lives change , from whatever 
We will still be , friends forever 
Lauren is such a bitch 
I don't even understand why guys like her, she's not even cute
She's not even pretty
Have you seen how much makeup she wears?
And by the way she Facetunes her pictures so much 
I honestly think she bought her followers
She barely gets any likes any way 
And you wanna know the craziest part about all of it? 
She doesn't even have any idea her boyfriend's been cheatin' on her this entire time I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
I wish everyone would leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Ring, ring-ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone
I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real or where I belong
Uh, day-to-day same thoughts
This is all the devil's fault
I ain't mean to name drop
Off three, I pop, all three, I'm off, all three
Should make it four like the rings on my Audi
Xans with the Everclear got me seein' foggy
Ironic how somethin' clear got me seein' foggy
Something ain't right 'bout the pills but I bought them
Something ain't right with my mind so I lost it
Drugs turn my knob, then I run, that's a faucet
But it ain't water, it's wine
I'm tired, I'm tired of gettin' high, it's exhausting
I was told it gets better with time
Ring, ring-ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone
I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real or where I belong
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Unless a Postmates' comin' on the way
But my cellphone isn't well-known
Go the hell on
"Pretty please, get me these
Buy me this, buy me that," bitch, hit your knees
I wasn't prepared for a guest
I'm aware of the stress, I don't care to impress
Can't you see that I am high on drugs?
And low on the sleep
I just wanna go somewhere and count my sheep
I'm tired, I'm tired
Gettin' high is exhausting
But I was told it gets better with time
Ring, ring-ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone
I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real or where I belongThis is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
We don't love these hoes, our hearts got colder
It's hard out here for a lonely stoner
I know I'm doing drugs, but so what?
Just pray to God I never throw up
I pray to God my plug, I blow up
I pray to God my plug still show up
I know the last time, we tried to rob him
He lucky, bro'nem ain't fucking off him
I'm drinking, driving in the Bentley coupe, so
It's hard for me to drive, I move too slow
I told you, baby, I ain't saving no ho
I only save the money; antihero
I burned my old clothes and got some new clothes
I left my old hoes and got some new hoes
My brother got a chopper and it's kickin' like Judo
He shootin' while I'm drivin' the two-door
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road

The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
I'm smokin' dope 'til I'm in a coma
The moon rock on me, I love the aroma
I get so high that I'm in the clouds with the fallen angels
Demons with halos
She love the coke, but not Coca-Cola
But she'll still pop it like a soda for ya
Her name rings bells like a Motorola
I lay the bitch off like I'm her employer
And she gon' ride like a roller coaster
And I'm gon' hide when the love is over
But it's far from over, losing composure
In a coffin, laying stiff like a boulder
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end of her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over

I hope you think of me when you're kissing
I hope you call, I'll decline, I'm busy
I keep on balling, Kobe, I'm swishing
You must be having an off game, you're missing
You got no money, that chump change you're getting
My Rollie cost the crib that you're renting
Ayy, you got no money, that chump change you're getting
My Rollie cost the crib that you're renting
I'm too much to grasp, you know you won't get me
You want my cash, you gotta come get me
I'm with the girl of my dreams, she with me
I told my ex to die slow, don't miss me
Too much to grasp, you know you won't get me
You want my cash, you gotta come get me
I'm with the girl of my dreams, she with me
I told my ex to die slow, don't miss me
I told my ex I'll see her in hell
Matter of fact, I don't wanna go there
I told my girl I'll give her the world
Let's go to London, I got a show there
Forget the past, I left all my hoes there
We're moving fast, there's no moving slow here
Girl if we crash, at least it was worth it
I'll make it last, you make me feel perfect
I want to be held close
I feel distant
I feel all alone
I said I want to be held close
I feel distant
I feel all alone 
To be held close
I feel distant
All alone Sometimes it feels like I can't die, 'cause I never was alive
Every day it feels like someone new dies, hope the news is a lie
This is my version of watching you cry, looking you in your eyes
This is my version of watching you die, took me by surprise
Yeah
Lost too many this year
Shed too many of them tears
Now a nigga richer
But it's way too many people missing from the picture
At the door, let me in, I'm looking for answers, yeah, yeah
At the door, let me in, I'm looking for answers, yeah, yeah
Now I'm getting richer
But it's too many people missing from the picture
Open up the door, yeah, yeah , let me in 
Sometimes it feels like I can't die, 'cause I never was alive
Every day it feels like someone new dies, hope the news is a lie
This is my version of watching you cry, looking you in your eyes
This is my version of watching you die, took me by surprise
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah
Cross my heart, hope to survive
That I'ma be the last rich nigga alive
They tell me that I'm finna OD in no time
I told 'em I'll do it on my time, not your time
Got my heart in a hellhole, it's on fire
But I won't let myself get trapped in here this time, time
Time will stop , time will stop 
Sometimes it feels like I can't die, 'cause I never was alive
Every day it feels like someone new dies, hope the news is a lie
This is my version of watching you cry, looking you in your eyes
This is my version of watching you die, took me by surprise
Yeah

Boat rocking back and forth, what's the commotion?
I told her I'ma drown in her, that bitch an ocean
If I can't make her smile, I'ma be acting wild
She got a new man, I'm gon' pull up on him and shoot him down
I been goin' through emotions, bloody emotions
Pour me a cup, I'ma nod out
Started pack smokin', good dope rollin'
Maybe Mary Jane'll help me put the pills down
Dead inside, catch a look at my ghost
I pull up in a Lambo' or 'Rari or Rolls
Got my girl by my side and they callin' us goals
Numb the pain, take these Percs to the mouth and the nose
I'm not a drug addict, got it all wrong
I'm just a love addict 'til my heart gone
I'm just a love addict with the love songs
You with me is where you belong

Demon girl, how come you hold me close?
I like it, don't let go
You are my overdose
In the underworld, we roam 
-oam 
-oam 
-oam 
-oam 
I was gettin' my heart broke, now I'm the heartbreaker
She be drawin' pentagrams, she a soul-taker
When she took me to her room, all I saw was three six
I know that's what heartbreak is made of
Three 9 on my wrist, bitch, hell upside
Cupid try to kill you, I'm in the crossfire
Demons come in handy like a spare tire
They put my life on the wire
Yeah, I'm gettin' higher and higher
Pill pop shorty, I do not need a lighter
Heart stop shorty, I'ma go out flyin'
Let me stop playin', bitch, I already died
Demon girl, how come you hold me close?
I like it, don't let go
You are my overdose
In the underworld, we roam 
-oam 
-oam 
-oam 
-oam 
Here we go
It was all heaven just a week ago
Now I'm up in hell with my eyes closed
Gettin' sucked up by a devil ho
Takin' these pills on an empty stomach
It's like gettin' fucked up with the devil, ho
Fuckin' to my favorite heavy metal, ho
We know all the words so it's special
So, so special
I loved her and let her go , fuck that
Maybe I'ma hold her close, get the fuck back
I'm about to overdose, and she love that
Story of a demon seducin' a young drug head
Demon girl, how come you hold me close?
I like it, don't let go
You are my overdose
In the underworld, we roam 
-oam 
-oam 
-oam 
-oam Sometimes, sometimes, sometime
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, uh
I wanna be by my lonely
I pop these Perc by my lonely
I put in work by my lonely
.40 on me, you know that's my homie
I wanna be by my lonely
I take these Perc by my lonely
I put in work by my lonely
.40 on me, you know that’s my homie
My mind sometimes gets dark and wild
My mind sometimes, ah
I don't wan' be bothered
Inhale, exhale, breathing just got a little harder
I mean well, I mean well
All’s well, it ends well
Inhale, exhale
Losing my sanity, probably
I'll see you in hell
Yeah, I'ma meet you there
As of lately, my demons, they bother me
When I'm sleeping, they sitting on top of me
And wherever I go, they will follow me
I fell into the pit and it's bottomless
They want my soul but it isn't my property
Try to take it from me, demonic robbery
Crazy the way that the devil'll lie to me
Just leave me alone, I could do bad on my own
I get high off my ass on my own
Paranoia is strong
What if she don't love me no more?
I hope I’m wrong
Sometimes, sometimes, sometime
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, uh
I wanna be by my lonely
I pop these Percs by my lonely
I put in work by my lonely
.40 on me, you know that’s my homie
I wanna be by my lonely
I take these Percs by my lonely
I put in work by my lonely
.40 on me, you know that's my homie
Oh, there ain’t no place like home
I wanna go back home
I hate the world we know, oh, oh
There ain't no place like home
I wanna go back home
I hate the world we know
Mind fumbling, fumbling, fumbling, fumbling
I wonder if, wonder if, wonder if, wonder if
I'm gonna live, gonna live
All these threats that I get from my enemies
Wonder why I keep a .40 right next to me
Scared of niggas running in my vicinity
I'ma be the killer, ain’t no one killing me
That's a better choice like voting for Hillary
Where I'm from niggas don't give a fuck
So we loadin' up and shooting like documentary
Numb to the core
I don't wanna feel shit anymore
I don't wanna feel rich anymore
Know that they want me dead
So I'm takin' meds until I fall on the floor
I don't know who to call anymore
I don't know what to call it anymore
Tears fall like raindrops, but nah, I don't wanna bawl anymore
Pick up the rock score, I pill pop some more
Why? It numbs me inside
I know it ain't right, but its part of the ride
There ain't no place like home
I wanna go back home
I hate the world we know, oh, oh, oh
There ain't no place like home
I wanna go back home
I hate the world we knowRun away
In fear of me dying today
Yeah, I run away
In fear of me dying today, ah
And I'm not the same
Who said I was subject to change?
My demons are breakin' out of their cage
I'm praying that I see another day 
I said my demons are breakin' out of their cage
On my knees, I pray for better days
Chip, chip, cheerio, everything's all good, right?
I got rich, I got rich, I'm livin' that fast life
Couple M's in my bank account, I got cash, right?
And that's supposed to make me happy
I got a couple questions
How come that shit don't ever make me happy?
Money give me an erection
But that don't mean it's gon' be everlasting
Yeah, I know it's a blessing
But how come it always feel like the devil plottin'
And the devil watchin'?
He see me buyin' all these watches
Benjamin Franklin in my pockets
Ooh, been a year of the glitz and the glam
And the TV channels, brain's going scramble
Scrambling sometimes 'cause this shit is hard to handle
Demons in my heart , they destroy me like a vandal 
Take my hand
Don't give up
Take my hand
Don't give up
Yeah, I run away
In fear of me dying today, ah
And I'm not the same
Who said I was subject to change?
My demons are breakin' out of their cage
I'm praying that I see another day 
I said my demons are breakin' out of their cage
On my knees, I pray for better days
Karma ain't what you think it is
Super stressed, still handle all of my business
Do the best I can, yes, I can
Yes, I am, misfortune
I know in the dark, they be lurking 
Same way they lurk in your head when they get in your mind
You don't wanna know what they're tryin' to find
I'll protect your soul 
Take my hand
Don't give up
Take my hand
Don't give up
Yeah, I run away
In fear of me dying today, ah
And I'm not the same
Who said I was subject to change?
My demons are breakin' out of their cage
I'm praying that I see another day 
I said my demons are breakin' out of their cage
On my knees, I pray for better daysCardo got wings
Now we cookin' up, hey
Yeah
Leave her in the past, but I know I'll miss her
I kept all of her paraphernalia
Left her makeup and her panties on my bedroom dresser
Think about the days when I used to undress her
Long gone, long gone, long gone 
Long gone, long gone, long gone 
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone 
Sorrow and sadness next to me
Old hoes see that I'm on, so they textin' me
Ex-bitch tryna finesse me, she won't get a damn thing
Listen to my story, it's depressing
Heartbreak mixed with the drugs, not the best thing
The devil tryna test me I'm failing, inhaling
You took it all back
All that heartbreak, that was a year ago
Wanted you back, so bad, but that's...
Long gone, long gone, long gone 
Long gone, long gone, long gone 
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone
What you don't seem to understand is
You really took my love for granted
You really had me feeling helpless, that's so selfish
Haven't been in love in a long while
Wait until my next girl finds out
Then I'm scared we gon' break up and fall out
Drownin' in my thoughts, baby, looking for a lighthouse
Ain't no sleep, I've been feeling like a night owl
Music turnt up, neighbors telling me to pipe down
On the other hand, I think I found my future wife
But she not here with me, so it get lonely at night, ayy
I hope, her love doesn't go away
I hope this ain't a phase
One more heartbreak and I'll be...
Long gone, long gone, long gone 
Long gone, long gone, long gone 
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone 
Long gone, long gone, long gone 
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone

I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh
I'm off the Percs, you don't condone it
You say it makes me act atrocious
But I can't stand life when I'm sober
Take my heart, I'll hand it over
Six months in, it gets colder
I don't want us to be over
Let's make love 'til we die
And let's fuck until we slump over
Be my first aid, I know that you hate to see me bleed
I don't deserve your love, I tend to fuck up everything
It feels like I'm not enough, 'nough, 'nough, no

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name

Lost in a dark place
Lost in a dark place, trapped in the crawlspace
In my mind, I get lost, then I wake up in a coffin
They tell me they care, they're just in love with the music
So they'll never know about the pain I go through
It's like a chain of reactions, all these demon attacks
From all the drugs that I'm taking to the women distracting me
From being myself, it's like I'm losing my traction
Kiss death on the lips, I have a fatal attraction
This is my heart, watch as my problems inspire me
Tear me apart, won't let the demons take over me
They took it too far, now I need some surgery
I'm falling apart
It's like I'm lost in the motions, use this song as a rope
To wrap around the commotion, tie the knot at my throat
I look at death as a notion, I don't want it no more
But it's too late to reverse it, as I fall on the floor
Lost in a dark place, lost in a dark place
Demons inspire me

BrrLost
I lost, I lost
I lost, I lost
Lost my mind, trapped in me
I don't know what's happening
I've been space traveling
Tryna find some inner peace, inner peace
Welcome to my abyss
Filled with sins and trifiling
Fake friends, I hate them
Delete them all, erase them
I'm getting lost in my abyss
Trials, tribulations and suffering
Mayhem will break them
Words from the evil faces
Drugs will fade them 
Pop three, I lace them 
Welcome to my abyss 
Pain and suffering 
Lost my mind, trapped in me
I don't know what's happening
I've been space traveling
Tryna find some inner peace, inner peace
It's pain in those words, you can hear it when I talk
But what's a life to live if you ain't got no risk involved?
And what's a slit to make if you ain't got no wrist involved?
Mixin' pills with the liquor, fuck, I'm finna risk it all
Still a cool dude, too smooth, just like olive oil
Known to pop pills, pop niggas and pop ollies, boy
And pop wheelies, ghost ride it, my mind is enlightened
I'm highest, the highest, don't need no ghostwriter
Bitch I speak for myself, but my health ain't my wealth
'Cause I'm rich in my bank, but I'm bad with myself
Bombin' like a kamikaze, I'm the shit to these hoes
I set the play, these niggas flock, they settin' picks for me, ho
I came in killin', I'm really fuckin' the industry up
These niggas shady, they really leavin' me mentally fucked
Trapped inside the abyss with a bad bitch in the front
With a blunt in my mouth and some purple codeine in the cup
Way spazzin' on they asses in all type of ways
Pop a couple Percs to take my life away
Nah, just a lighter day, just a brighter day
She doin' all the lines, she had a whiter day
Freestylin', no writers, ayy
That mean when the songs come out I get paid
No cuts, give no fucks
I show out before I even go and show up
So what? I drink Henny till I throw up

Pull up on 'em like beep, that's a tow truck
Choppa on me like damn, nigga, don't duck
Duck, goose when I catch 'em
Niggas askin' questions, stop throwin' hatchets
Never had a father, always been a bastard
Fuck with me I'll beat your ass, your head is in a plaster
They don't make sense like spelling rich backwards, I'm madder
Run up, that's okay your head is on a platter
Outta space off the codeine, I'm on Saturn
Niggas got it backwards, dyslexic patterns
I don't believe in you niggas, a nigga atheist
Say this I spray it, say it don't spray it
I'll spray it don't say it, presidential brain from your main, S. Palin
Pull up on the scene, judge a nigga no bailiff
Flow go cold, shine like VVS, nigga fuck rose gold
It's like 50k inside my wardrobe

You a whore, ho, you know it, I don't gotta say it
Pull up on the scene, my choppa just like Alizé
Pop it like a bottle, I fuck on a model
I don't wanna fuck if that bitch don't plan to swallow
I told her boyfriend he could swallow all the hollows
Don't believe me, send your location I'll be there tomorrow
Lost my mind, trapped in me

You had me fucked up, had me thinkin' I would die here for you
Shit got me fucked up, can't believe I was so blinded by you

Fightin' for my heart and baby, I never lose

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh
I'm off the Percs, she don't condone it
You say it makes me act atrocious
But I can't stand life when I'm sober
Take my heart, I'll hand it over
Six months in, it gets colder
I don't want us to be over
Let's make love 'til we die
And let's fuck until we slump over
Be my first aid, I know that you hate to see me bleed
I don't deserve your love, I tend to fuck up everything
It feels like I'm not enough, 'nough, 'nough, no
This a conversation, not a love song
Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh
Everything that's wrong with me, is everything that's wrong with you
You threw the blade, I caught the knife
I'm right back in your room tonight
Reflections in the broken glass
No, I can't fix your broken past
Count my blessings, close my eyes
I'm right back in your room tonight 
I can't escape your shadow 
I can't forget what we don't know 
Your love is a sentence to death row
And you've got a seat in the front row 
Hold me close but you're cold as ice 
Watch me choke on every line 
And it feels like Hell tonight, it feels like Hell
Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh
We met in a Twilight Zone
I fall apart but she keep me whole
We met on the West Coast
But I still see Miami in your soul
Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?

150 be the gang, and NLMB coming strong 
She said she wanna love me, I told her to leave my heart alone 
I hate it when I start to care about these evil ass hoes 
I know that they don’t love me, they just want my fucking cash flow 
These hoes manipulate to gather money, and that’s wrong 
But who am I to judge? I used to rob and jug and hit them stains 
I can't blame another motherfucker for doing the same thing 
Especially when you broke, that’s the—worst pain 
But off me, bae, money you will not make
Oh, ain't that the truth, I'm preaching, having church, oh 
For that bag, these hoes taking they shirts—off 
Even teach they self how to squirt, oh 
I had to expose them, guess I'm a jerk, oh

Fifty shots to his head, he need back up, for real
I don't like toting guns, but I may have to shoot to kill 
Real niggas hate that I'm winning, they don't wanna see me live 
They too lazy to get it, its a lot of shit to give up 
Just stay focused on your mission, and don't ever, ever give up 
Codeine and the oxycodone really fuckin' up my liver
My family scared of me overdosin', I know that shit give 'em shivers 
But don't worry, tell 'em God got me, just to uplift 'em
But deep inside, sometimes, I wonder if God can even hear us
But I'ma keep praying 
I'ma keep hope up
I'ma keep faith 
Still gon' be a pistol-toter
Shoot him in his face 
If he get in the way of the cake 
Heat him up, I feel like a thermometer
If it's a problem, I'm pulling out, he get baked

They say, "Livin’ life is free," I'll have to deny
'Cause everyday I pay the price
I wake up feelin’ like last night was a wild car ride
Welcome to the fast life
I pop these, watch how the time flies
Outer-space, black skies lookin' like sci-fi
But that's only half of me
That's only half of me, that's one side
But don't be sad with me
And don't feel bad for me, it's alright
Addictions remind me of the summer
’Mind you, I was younger
Trying to kill my hunger, yeah
Addictions remind me of the summer
’Mind you, I was younger
Trying to kill my hunger
Percocets, nicotine, red promethazine
Good sex, fast cars, I'd crash anything
That is a smoke screen, none of those things make me happy
Sold my soul, now I can buy anything
Sad but I’m not a bitch, don't try anything
'Cause I'll kill gladly, that’s the only thing that make me happy
Turn the frown off when the racks in
Ain't no fentanyl up in my xans
If I could end all of the withdrawls
I would, but sadly, I can't
Thinkin' back, it probably started with the vyvanse
Now I'm starin' at oxycodone in my hand
Rehab'll only ruin my plans
On the bright side, I'm makin' progression
I was takin' four, now I'm takin' one less
'Til I drop the codeine in the Sunkist
Said, "Fuck it," grabbed the pint and poured the whole shit
Addictions remind me of the summer
'Mind you, I was younger
Trying to kill my hunger, yeah
Addictions remind me of the summer
'Mind you, I was younger
Trying to kill my hungerEven when I'm sleep, I feel awake when you're away
Everything with you is such a chase, cut to the chase
Almost left my side the other day, it makes me shake
Knowin' you were gon' walk away, you can't be replaced
Can't tell you how I feel, I can't explain
For you I'ma try to get these lyrics out my brain
And for you I will fly, through the hell, through the flames
Always, always, love you always
For your love, workin' all day, fuck a off day
You lookin' cute in your Bape shit baby, you could go Ape
All of these other bitches are Sheneneh, Martin like Payne
I am in love with a beautiful lady, she's in my brain
Star you set my heart on fire, 420 blaze
Yeah, no cliche, I can't explain
I got your name, tatted on my brain, tatted on my mind
Teen Titan, got the Starfire by my side
Clark Kent if she kiss me, it make me fly
Sad boy, if she leaves me it makes me cry
Flash boy, if she needs me, be there in no time
She's all right, so I gave it a go, I gave it a turn
I gave her my heart, I'm willin' to learn
And it changed my life, I'm tryna get close with the stars tonight
Even when I'm sleep, I feel awake when you're away
Everything with you is such a chase, cut to the chase
Almost left my side the other day, it makes me shake
Knowin' you were gon' walk away, you can't be replaced
Can't tell you how I feel, I can't explain

Like, talk about the talent that you see from him
You just brought him out on stage in front of all these people
I see you said he is like the best freestyler alive
He like
He like that 2009 or 2000, he probably like the 2006, maybe 2006 to 2009 Lil Wayne
He that, he that nigga
And then they seen him do the, uh
He'll do another version of the song freestyle
He did like three, three, four songs
Over one beat
All freestyle, like which one we like?
Yeah, man, just let me know, I'ma text you

Congratulations on your...
Yo, shoutout to Juice too, man

Where he rapped for an hour, like what the fuck?
And to be so young
He like mastered that so fucking quickly
Yeah
It's really sad man, that, that
Like his potential was so off the charts
Period
You know who the best freestyler I've ever seen is?
Yeah?
Juice WRLD
Juice, yeah
Have you ever seen his freestyles?
Yeah
They're, they're so, they're never-ending
He can do it for like an hour
Ju-ice, yeah
And he makes total sense the entire time
And is actually really, like good, like intricate flow patterns
He, like to me, he was the best freestyler I've ever seen
And he was like the best hitmak- he was like
I really feel like he was the most talented, eh, like songwriter in music
If, I can't imagine there just goin' in there and doin' one-
Juice did that, my friend, Benny worked with Juice
Yeah
And he would say, he would go in the booth
Go three minutes over the beat, and it be a hit
And then he said, "Okay, another one"
And then he'd go three minutes over the beat
And it be a different hit
Shit
And then he'd be like, "Just pick whatever version you want"
He would tell Benny to cut it up?
No, not even cut it up, just like pick
Like, which hit do you want?
He freestyled- the whole song is freestyled
Ugh
Hits
Ugh
Like smash hits
How, how, how?
I sit in my room for six months and write a verse
This guy goes in there and it's four minutes and it's a smash
I think, like, what
What Juice was to our generation, bro
And the impact that he had on us is what Biggie did for New York, for real
Like, I really think, um
What he had, that like, that Biggie, Pac effect
You know what I'm sayin'?

You've been providing me depression
You've been abusing your position
Using your words as a weapon
You got me paranoid of other women
I'm knowing you got a ploy
You on a mission, you wanna see me destroyed
Oh no, you play with me like I'm a toy
Oh no, and I can't take it anymore
So you gotta leave

You got somethin' to say, go 'head and point, you speak up
Tryna break me down because they can't defeat us
I'ma break her down like that girl a nina
Should've listened to my boy, he said, "Don't keep her"
Nowadays I love you so much, I can't leave you

Makin' brash decisions
That's what they tell me, but they don't get it, can't grasp the image
Cashin' it, I'm past bitches, in a love with a woman
She past drippy, the Gucci slippers, Versace linens
I'll take her out to dinner, she usually hibachi grillin'
Poppin' and raillin' the last of the Perkys before we kick 'em

Bae, I'm high off narcotics, so your name I cannot remember
Using Opiates overly, openly fuckin' up my image, yeah
One thing you need to know about me is

One thing you need to know about me is
This rockstar life turned me to a junkie
Another thing you need to know about me is
I'm full of addictions, this is just vindictive
Subject a lil' sensitive, maybe I should just shallow it
Went from talkin' depression to money-makin' prerogative
Still a smart guy, could've got a scholarship
Sayin' fuck college, I'ma tell you how I started it
It took one phone call from G-Money, that's my dawg
Turned me from a twenty dollar nigga to millions in my drawers

Blood, sweat, and tears, money parted it, Moses
Used to roll mid, now it's gas, what I'm smokin' 
Like I farted, hit the gas, I'm in motion 
Out, departed, wrist hangin' out the window, cost your apartment
This the brightest that my life ever been
I need diamonds all over for when it get dark again
I call my mama up and told her that the devil marchin' in
She sent me Bible verses, then I got distracted by some nudes from a sex worker
Who am I to not text back? That's networking
Who am I to lie about my life? I know the truth hurts
Who am I to say that this ain't one of my best verses?
Uh-oh, too bad it's over 
She ain't nothin' but a no good, diamond watchin' woman
Only love me 'cause she see Versace on my linens

Sitting here, feeling so terrified
And no one knows where the answer lies
How you gon' tell me what I gotta live without?
When you don't know half the things that I live without
I highly doubt, that you have the same things holding you down
This is me telling you, you would never understand
Things ain't what they seem from the outside, lookin' in
Unexplainable, unexplainable, unexplainable
Even if you look again
Even if you look again
Even if you look again 
Even if you look again
In the back of my head, there's something haunting
I know it wants me, to end up lonely
I'm searching for my peace, somebody help me
Feels like I'm about to die slowly
Oh, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round in my soul
It's been a couple years still don't feel whole
At least I found home, she's all I know
So I'll be damned if I let her go
This is me telling you, you would never understand
Things ain't what they seem from the outside, lookin' in
Unexplainable, unexplainable, unexplainable
Even if you look again
Even if you look again
Even if you look again 
Even if you look again
You don't know what I need, I need my life
Back to the way that it was
Nowadays, I feel alone
Said I didn't have shit, but I had my friends
Nowadays, I don't really know on what to spend
It's always so wrong in my head
Thinkin' 'bout what I should've said
Could've, would've, should've done it all
In my room with nothing but these walls
The thrill is something I can't control
These demons taking over my soul
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can
This is me telling you, you would never understand
Things ain't what they seem from the outside, lookin' in
Unexplainable, unexplainable, unexplainable
Even if you look again
Even if you look again
Even if you look again 
Even if you look againYeah
Won't you fall into my arms?
Won't you fall into my arms?
Your tears fall, it's all my fault
The tears don't fall, they crash around me
Only real rockers will get that part
She told me that I don't have appreciation for stars
If that's true, then how'd I fall in love with a star?
She told me, that I don't have appreciation for art
If that's true, then how'd I fall in love with her scars?
I told her, take her shoes off as she running inside my heart
All the dirt from the outside world will leave me scarred
It's been a couple times I almost watched you leave
When you're not with me, baby, I can't breathe, ayy
Uh, I remember I was in New York when you called me
I got some bad news, I got some bad news
I was in my hotel room when you called me
Turned to a sad dude, mentally bad dude
I don't wanna say too much and start arguing
I wanna love you, don't wanna hurt you
But I can't lie, that shit been on my mind
Since you told me, I ain't know how to tell you
"Sad face, what's wrong?"
"I'ma tell you later, bae, I'm on my way home"
That's when I get to stressin' and assuming the worst
Blowing up your phone, tryin' not to go berserk
When you called me and you said what you said, that shit hurt
Yeah, that hurt the worst
Said it was a accident, I hope it wasn't on purpose
Only been six months, but it feels like years
Remember South by, taking Xanax out your purse
We was high, love on our mind
Heavy vibes, souls intertwined
I ain't gonna lie, I damn near died
When you told me what happened that night
We was high, love on our mind
Heavy vibes, souls intertwined
I ain't gonna lie, I damn near died
When you told me what happened that night
Won't you fall into my arms?
Your tears fall, it's all my fault
The tears don't fall, they crash around me
Only real rockers will get that part
She told me that I don't have appreciation for stars
If that's true, then how I fall in love with a star?
She told me, that I don't have appreciation for art
If that's true, then how'd I fall in love with her scars?
I told her, take her shoes off as she running inside my heart
All the dirt from the outside world will leave me scarred
It's been a couple times I almost watched you leave
When you're not with me, baby, I can't breathe, ayyCHASETHEMONEY, CHASETHEMONEY

Teacher called, asked, "What's wrong?"
Slurrin' back, you say he gone
Runnin' out of downers, you look down at your dresser
You see a 8 ball of all pure Colombian pleasure
It was left by that dude you tried to fuck to forget me
You snort a line and rail a Perc to see which one is better
Walkin' 'round in your mind picking up my belongings
I got a lot of shit here, it's been taking forever
Walkin' 'round in your heart with some fuel and some fire
The same fire tatted on me heart destroyer forever, goodbye

A lot of things are different, you not being here is what I was missing
Feel like I'm in a heaven house, still pour up in a Hell's Kitchen
In Chicago makin' heartbreak songs, eatin' on some hell's chicken
Miami calling me, oh-oh, them calls I'm missin'

I see through all the glisten and glamour 
It's amazing what niggas would do for the fame, they be on camera 
Never thought like that, never will
I guess I'm too damn real, to care about what the people feel
So, I carry on, changing the world from dusk to dawn
Yeah, I know I do wrong, but I can't help it so I move along
Just keepin' it pushin', and I know that they lookin'

"Thank you, bro."
"That, I was struggling to come up with words. I didn't even know I could do that, I couldn't even think of words. You were comin' up with whole songs, and I was strugglin', I'm like what could I say, aho. We'll do one more?"
"Mhm."
"Yeah?"
"Let's do it."
"How's that taste? That taste good?"
"Mango."
"Mango?"
"I'll be asleep bro. I'll be, wargh."
"No no. This is-This is nicotine."
"Oh, is it?"
"Yeah."
"Alright, lemme try that."
"It's nicotine. Hits good, doesn't it?"
"Yeah, that's good, man."
"It's like a cigarette, a little bit."
"You wanna-Try my one."
"It was you that had that big ass rig?"
"Yeah, yes yes."
"But they don't sell Juul pods in-in-in London that have 5% nicotine, though."
"Right."
"This has 5, y'all have, what was it? Maximum 1?"
"That's 3."
"1.7."
"It's 3? I think all y'alls have 3 though, right?"
"3 maximum. Them shits was trash."
"Shit. It's cloudy."
"Yeah. I f- I-I couldn't even do this- I remember when I couldn't even do this. I used to try and blow clouds, and I would be-"
"I-I hope I don't get fired for doing this in the studio, 'cause m-my bosses are outside."
"It's not no weed."
"I- yeah, I mean, I don't wanna get fired, I just started."
"Well, you're in America, dude."
"What-What... Was that caramel?"
"Uh?"
"That's caramel?"
"Yeah, it's nice, huh?"
"If crème brûlée Juul tasted like that, I-I would smoke crème brûlée, but crème brûlée tastes horrible."

The highest, the fliest
Flyer than a pilot, my gun a library and it got a silence
But I still want Santa-ty in a piece, so
So I'll do anything to kill all the violence
But back in Chicago is bustin'
Niggas really shooting guns like the shit is nothing
Killing mom's kids and children, but this shit is disgusting
We gon' need more than a talk, more than a discussion
All I know is get the cash, yeah, get the cash
Catch up, tell them niggas, "Catch up"
They gon' need some backup
Remember hittin' stains like mustard and ketchup
Now I'm 200 MPH, they won't catch us
If you can, but you can't
I'm the motherfucking champ
You ain't Triple 9, then fuck you, get the fuck out my camp
Niggas thinking that they in it
They always come and doubt until I ball like a warrior
Switch up like I'm Durant
I'm a shoot from the three, niggas can't fuck with me
Not with the fuckery
Hotter than the summer be
Niggas really think they spell it out
But I'ma spell it clearly
Like a nigga gettin' an "A" and doing a fucking spelling bee
"Ay! Juice WRLD in the building!"
"Uh huh."
"Man, you just made my day, bro."
"You just made my day, bro."
"And that in the rest of my life."
"Man, love love."
"Just to- Just to re-in-store the faith."
"Love, sir."
"Lyrics is still there, pull neck."

No matter what it isGotta pack my bags and hit the road
I don't wanna be here anymore
I can’t hold on, I gotta let go
But first there's a couple things you should know
The day your heart became my home
Mine wasn't cold, now I’m froze
I don't wanna drop another tear
Roll up face blunts to face the fear
I wanna drown in your love, I'm scared of the deep end
You met my mom and my friends, so I guess I'm too deep in
And I won't give up no no, but its takes two, it takes two, to Tango
What am I to do, it seems I fell in love with you
Instincts telling me to move a little closer but I'm scared so
Gotta pack my bags and hit the road
I don't wanna be here anymore
I can't hold on, I gotta let go
But first there’s a couple things you should know
The day your heart became my home
Mine wasn’t cold, now I'm froze
Gotta pack my bags and hit the road
I don’t wanna be here anymore

I hope the memories we make last all life long, yeah
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up 
Daytrip took it to ten, hey
Last night was a blur, so girl, I wasn't sure
If we made love or if we made something more
Last thing I remember is me walking out the door
Next thing you know woke up on the floor 
I don't know whose house this is but I know I'm in Hollywood
Scrambled for my keys, then I stumbled to the car
I look in the backseat, what do I see?
Bro passed out, layin' next to a bad broad
Looks like they had a good time, I must've too
'Cause for some reason I can't remember my night
Reach in my pockets, what do I find?
Half a Percocet, two hundred dollars and a weed pipe
That's when somebody hit my phone line
Sayin', "Yesterday was wild," asking if I'm alright
I don't know what happened, but I wanna know
I guess we gotta do it all over again tonight
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up
Ridin' 'round town with my niggas
We gon' make a movie, smoke this doobie
Yeah, let's chill a while
Every single night I'm lookin' for a chick to pickup
Now I'm on my mission, diamonds glisten, so bye
Give a fuck 'bout what they say about me
Since I was a youngin' I been 'bout my dreams
And I gotta thank the Lord for lookin' out, the Hell I've seen
And I can't forget my family and my niggas know I got it
Feelin' like I'm fallin' back, no, no
Yeah, the forty-two overflow the cup though
Who else feelin' low? I know you know just how the song go
Praying for some angels, and I'm hopin' I'll be alright
3AM, at war
Wish I fuckin' knew, man, wish I could have done more
Thinkin' 'bout you kid, this shit is killin' my heart
But this gonna save the world, you did it homie, my God
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up

My hobbies are catchin’ bodies, riding bikes and skateboards
Instagram, like, "Look at Juice new girl"
Some of y'all is really fuckin’ with his new girl
But some of y'all are like, "Fuck her, that's his new girl"
Like who the hell invited her to live in Juice WRLD?
I think Juice WRLD invited her to live in Juice WRLD
That's Juice girl, nigga that’s not your girl
Uh, so with that being said, I'm holding her close and taking off clothes
And taking her soul, letting her know that she really make me whole
She told me that we perfect
So if we break up I'm gon' turn into a serpent
She got a new nigga, well I'll be in they bushes lurkin'
With what? With a .40
What I'm gon' do? I'ma murk 'em
She told me that we perfect
So if we break up I'm gon' turn into a serpent

Dirty money cleaned by tears, new bankroll
Smokin' 'til my eyes drop tears, then they shut closed
I don't know what's goin' on with me, I don't got time for it though
'Cause I'm too busy roamin' the globe
Fly to London for a show
Had a luncheon in the castle dungeon, all the dragons calling me bro
You're in my abyss
There's no escaping
There's no hiding
This is it, this is all
This is the end

Tryna put negativity up in the air
Pray to God that my enemies come to an end
It was way more simple when I was a kid
High tide
I sit back and watch the time fly
Then I pretend that I'm alright
Use my hellfire as some sunshine 
High tide
I sit back and watch the time fly
Then I pretend that I'm alright

I was doin' Percocets everyday, wasn't fucking with them Xans 
Here I go, here I go again 
Here I go, here I go again 
I'm in Los Angeles I just came back from Japan 
Everyday I was doin' Percocets, wasn't fucking with them Xans 
Turned studio to a trap house, like I was whipping with the pans
I spent 3,000 on some pants 
She a horny dog, she just fucked me and my mans 
Yeah, a groupie ain't a fan 
Still ain't trust her, so I fucked her with an Uzi in my hand 
Woah, rocking that Rick, dawg 
Feel like a beat , dog, I got the drip sauce 
Pocket watching got you pissed off 
Just wait until you start staring at my wrist, dawg, ah 
Let me not get superficial 
I'm a sad boy when it come to heartbreak, it's in my lyrics 
Y'all know that I got millions , y'all know that I got a mansion 
On top of mansion, that's a big building 
Popping like wheelies, I put the "Milli'" in "Million"
Wrist so cold like the AC on 
All I care 'bout is hunnids, I tear these twenties like an ACL 
Whatchu know about money, uh
I got my throwback Gucci on 
Finna get in that oochie coochie
Fuck a hoochie to this song 
Bootleg movies in my house, can't go to the movies, dog 
I'm too important, they ask me if I have competition I say, "Nah" 
They disappointed 
I think I need a doctors appointment, he tell me that nothing wrong 
I still think that nigga wrong 
Here I go, here I go again 
I'm in Los Angeles I just came back from Japan 
Everyday I was doin' Percocets, wasn't fucking with them Xans 
Turned studio to a trap house, like I was whipping with the pans
I spent 3,000 on some pants 
She a horny dog, she just fucked me and my mans 
Yeah, a groupie ain't a fan 
Still ain't trust her, so I fucked her with an Uzi in my hand 
I see them haters watching me on the internet 
Like, here he go, talkin' bout his new watch again 
That's a two-tone skeleton AP on his hand 
We get it, yeah, I know you get it 
But you couldn't afford it if you worked for your life, nigga
That's your forever girl?
I just may go rent her 
And drive that bitch around like a Mercedes Sprinter 
So much money they think I got a money printer 
So much drama sometimes I think I'm on Jerry Springer 
I know some of these racist motherfuckers hate to pay up
Like why the hell did we just have to book this dirty nigga? 
Times change , but I still got that mask on my face like I'm in the KKK 
Bought a brand new guitar and a piano and a brand new AK 
Yeah, just in case, a fuck, nigga get in my way 
Two 33 shots to a nigga in his face
Take two off his top like he gettin' a fade
Send 'em rock bott' niggas around your way
Bought a new watch, cost over 100k 
So bright, can't see the time today 
Yeah, but it's my time today , I'm gon' shine today 
Yesterday, tomorrow, ayy, that mean I'm in my prime, okay

Man of the year, still got problems
Lookin' in the mirror, you look awful
Talkin' to myself, do it too often
JK, Juice WRLD, you're so awesome
Um, running up funds
Bottle full of pills, let's have fun
No cheap thrills, only rich ones
Fire drills, hotter than the sun
They say life's a puzzle, well I'ma piece it together
But from the way I'm movin', I'll probably be piecing forever
I date a bad bitch, she'll be over decent forever
Even with fake tits, these other hoes just decent forever
My lady said she saw a baddie in the hotel lobby
Well love, let's fuck her together
We got the world to our backs, give a fuck, never have
Middle fingers up, we're screaming fuck 'em forever
Let's raise our hands, let's sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know my lyrics saved you
Let's raise our hands, let's sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know I helped you break through

Big headed, in my mind, I'm always thinking of songs
Big dick too, probably won't fit in your mom
I met my shorty thick, that's the type of shit that I'm on
I got to admit it, she helped me found where I belong
Stay down with me through all of my rights and my wrongs
Now it's me and her together a lifelong
Lock her heart up like the key, she ain't finna make one
My ups and downs, I'll drive them down
In London town, cheers to the golden years
My ups and downs, I'll drive them down
In London town, cheers to the golden years

With money, you can make a smash
There is nothing quite as wonderful as money, money, money, money
There is nothing like a newly minted pound
Everyone must hanker for the butchness of a banker
It's accountancy that makes the world go 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
You can keep your Marxist ways, for it's only just a phase
Money, money, money makes the world go 'round 
Monte Carlo, big sharks on my ankles

Tropicana diamonds, rock 'em by the 10s 
I'm just drinkin' Act, Kurt Cobain 
Money on your dawg and go bust his brains 
Leave him on the sidewalk like he gettin' a tan 
I grow micro-soft drinkin' oxygen

Hop out on the block with a AK, make him do the cha-cha-cha 
I rode the Dropbox with your bae and I got my rocks off, woo
She sucked the socks off of me and they was Gucci 
I bent her over in the Bentley Spur and I didn't eat her coochie
I'm livin' life as a pimp 
I'll put a bitch on your shrimp 
I'm high in the sky like a blimp

Bought a mansion in LA today, I'm under 25
But where I come from niggas usually don't make it out alive
I'm thanking God for everything, so many blessings in my life
Yeah, still keep a pipe 'cause niggas love to die 
Let it sing like Mariah, everywhere I go keep the fire
A lot of old niggas hate on the young niggas, it's time for them to retire
We ain't wanna come to your party, no way, no reason to invite us
Parties are so last year, everybody end up fighting us

On the road, wit my boo and my crew, yeah, my team

Huh, now I'm swimmin', ooh
Now I'm drownin', now I'm floatin' with the fishes, ooh
Take a look inside my life and see how I'm livin', ooh
I remember when I couldn't afford a Honda Civic
Now I could take the money from my tour and buy a Bugatti with it
Huh, Exhibit A, I may go pimp my ride
Huh, Exhibit B, fat pockets, Benjamins inside
Highway of life, no traffic, enjoy the ride

You don't know me like you think you know me
Say you love me, baby girl, then show me
Arguments, all you do is blow me
But when you leave I'm so fuckin' lonely
I walk, walk away, away from all my problems
I look, look at you, look at you to solve 'em
Now I see, now I see, that is the problem
Co-dependence, not independent
Now I see, now I see, I see through the darkness
Climbing out of the hole which I fall in
Finding peace in a world full of sorrow
I'll try, I'll try
Love, live let her go
Fuck that, hold her close
Do I get high off her love
Or just perky overdose?
All of those options are tempting
Still, wish we were never-ending
You don't know me like you think you know me
Say you love me, baby girl, then show me
Arguments all you do is blow me
But when you leave I'm so fuckin' lonely
You don't know me like you think you know me
Say you love me, baby girl, then show me
Arguments all you do is blow me
But when you leave, when you leave
Oh oh oh, oh oh
This ain't heaven, this hell with a smile
Oh oh, oh oh

Hold my hand, yeah yeah yeah, and don't give up on us
Got a fire a desire I got love fever
Let us dance, yeah yeah yeah, I'm the devil in a tux

Mello made it right
We don't get along
We don't get along
We don't get along
We don't get along
Looking in the mirror with these words on my tongue
I've come to this conclusion
We don't get along
Saving myself from myself is a job, but someone's got to do it
So let's just move along
I'm all fucked up, but it's all my fault
But I ain't wanna do it
But temptation is strong
Now I'm left in the cold, let my story be told
Let my story be told 
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Pain in my cardiac, matches the pain in my brain
Living in the shadows, you know where to find me at
The place where they don't dare speak good things
Make out session, oh am I late?
Had another make out session with codeine
I kiss her, she kiss me to sleep
Having Hollywood dreams since 2016
We don't get along
Looking in the mirror with these words on my tongue
I've come to this conclusion
We don't get along
Saving myself from myself is a job, but someone's got to do it
So let's just move along
I'm all fucked up, but it's all my fault
But I ain't wanna do it
But temptation is strong
Now I'm left in the cold, let my story be toldSay she know my name

Never have you waiting, baby, I'll be on time
Crazy how you the one on top of these mountains I climb
Lately, I been over anxious, you make it all right
I've never felt a love like this, first time in my life
Whenever I'm in a crisis, you stand by my side
And ride, you're so righteous
You hate it when I get high, so high I look lifeless
Yeah, it is what it is, but whatever it is, it's all the way 'til the end
You're so good at readin' my mind
Oh, how I love spending time, time, time
I, I hit the ground sometimes
But it's alright 'cause we all have a downside
All I had was a glimpse
Lost in a maze in my mind at the time
So many demons inside of me, shit don't make sense
When you wake up in hell while you laying in your bed
Wonder how the fuck did I get here or when? 
I'm questioning everything again
Hold her tight, won't let go of her hand
Never have you waiting, baby, I'll be on time
Crazy how you the one on top of these mountains I climb
Lately, I been over anxious, you make it all right
I've never felt a love like this, first time in my life
Whenever I'm in a crisis, you stand by my side
And ride, you're so righteous
You hate it when I get high, so high I look lifeless
Yeah, it is what it is, but whatever it is, it's all the way 'til the end
Got an angel with me while I'm running through these hell pits
Me and her can share the world and end up being selfish, uh
Pretty as hell, feel her like braille, Cupid nailed it
She my umbrella when the rain storms hit
Some days high tides, some black skies
Demons leave my crib with bloody nose and black eyes
My lady choking out the Devil on my left side
She reviving me with TLC, wink with my left eye
Let's make plans, draw outlines
Take this chance of a life time
Replacements, there ain't no one
I go through the most, but you help me stay afloat
Never have you waiting, baby, I'll be on time
Crazy how you the one on top of these mountains I climb
Lately, I been over anxious, you make it all right
I've never felt a love like this, first time in my life
Whenever I'm in a crisis, you stand by my side
And ride, you're so righteous
You hate it when I get high, so high I look lifeless
Yeah, it is what it is, but whatever it is, it's all the way 'til the endTell me what's it like to fall in love
I’ve been shopping at the Drugs-R-Us
No outlet, but the plugs are us
Too busy getting too fucked up
Tell me what's it like to fall in love
I've been shopping at the Drugs-R-Us
No outlet, but the plugs are us
Too busy getting too fucked up
Too much Oxy in my body, I don’t know if I can take it
Everything is in slow motion, like I'm stuck inside the matrix
I treat my demons like they blunts, I just roll them up and face 'em
Underground railroad drugs got me like a slaver
Run away from my insecurities, I feel evasive
Sometimes I look at my past, and wish that I could just erase it
I don't fuck with that nigga in the mirror, I feel like I'm racist
It's a drill off the pills, major pain, when the pain hit
Relapse, now I'm in a daze, this shit feel amazing
Been high for a couple days, this shit really brazy
Take the pills a couple ways, snort it, don't be basic
And that’s bad advice, but I know that you gonna take it
Bad conscience taking over on the daily
I blame it on myself, and the decisions that I’m making
From taking too much to dating an evil lady
I put myself in Hell
Tell me what's it like to fall in love
I’ve been shopping at the Drugs-R-Us
No outlet, but the plugs are us
Too busy getting too fucked up
Tell me what's it like to fall in love

Contemplating what I should've said
Contemplating what I should’ve did
Been like this since I was a little kid
Molly popping feel like Little Bill
Chase thrills 'till my face go numb, numb
Uh, life's a bitch, I'ma gonna make mine cum
Like, sit on my face with it, uh-huh
Time is precious, can't afford to waste it uh-uh

Take 'em too far

StynYeah, we're laying in bed
You see the— I lock eyes,  our eyes lock 
Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh
I'm off the Percs, you don't condone it
You say it makes me act atrocious
But I can't stand life when I'm sober
Take my heart, I'll hand it over
Six months in, it gets colder
I don't want us to be over
Let's make love 'til we die
And let's fuck until we slump over
Be my first aid, I know that you hate to see me bleed
I don't deserve your love, I tend to fuck up everything
It feels like I'm not enough, 'nough, 'nough, no
This a conversation, not a love song
Woah, we met in a Twilight Zone
I fall apart but she keep me whole
We met on the West Coast
But I still see Miami in your soul
Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh
I wanna know, is it gon' be forever, or temporary?
If you leave, it'll hurt, keep the tissue ready
Got the drugs on the table, I'm ready
I put Rick on your slippers, no Cinderella
Remember when you went to the fortune teller
She told you, we "need each other"
Ha, what if she trippin? I'm just kiddin'
I'm here to serve a purpose
Girl, I know I ain't picture perfect
One more thing I know for certain
If you leave, I'll close the curtains
Back to the sad shit
Guess that's that "emo rap" shit
In the studio, workin' my ass off
After that, go back just to work your clit
That's as real as it gets, I'm f'real
It look like somebody spill, you so wet
On the pills, 24 hours later, still hittin' that, yeah
Bill Clinton checks
I used that to pay my mama rent
I know that's irrelevant, but
Back to the main focus, I think that you're gorgeous
You love the way that I stroke it, signin' my name on your neck
You used to make potions, playin' 'round with witchcraft
I wonder if you'll put that in my lean and I'd drink that
Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, ohI can't keep it together 
Forget it you can keep it forever 
I can't keep it together 
I'm fallin' apart no I can't keep it together 
If I gave you my heart then you can keep it forever 
Baby if I take this pill then I'll be sleeping forever 
Damn I love my narcotics lovin' you is hypnotic 
I'm fallin' apart no I can't keep it together 
If I gave you my heart then you can keep it forever

Junkie baby 
Mixin' pills with the liquor got a nigga faded 
Off the shrooms, so my room look like different places 
Lookin' in the mirror ayy I see different faces 
Wake up then I see you but you not there 
Maybe you're a ghost ho, but I'm not scared 
Love is not fair, love is not clear 
But it still shines like a chandelier 
If you're still mine by the end of the year then I'll be fine, 
But when you're not here, I go out my mind 
I guess pussy's power right word to feline 
I'm fallin' apart no I can't keep it together 
If I gave you my heart then you can keep it forever 
Baby if I take this pill then I'll be sleeping forever 
Damn I love my narcotics lovin' you is hypnotic

Look over to her, she doin' her make up
I'm her blessin' and her curse
I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand
I wake up 
Still could see the Perc in my eyes, fucked up
I know satan's here but he's in disguise
I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand
I see her face every day
Sometimes, I'm lost in her maze
Sometimes, I'm lost in her space
Sometimes, I don't know what to say
Plus the drugs that she takes, so happened to be my favorite
The Percocets make me late
Every day, happy belated
I was younger than young, when I wanted drug love
Now it's not what I want, I care too much about her
But I can't front, I still pop, sip, roll my blunts
Three drugs at once, wonderin' if I'll make the risin' sun
I'm worried about you
You ask me if I'm high, I say "Yeah, I took about two" 
Plus two, bet I still fuck you
Prayin' I make it 'til the mornin' by the end of the night
When I wake up, look over at him
He's still so fucked up, I'm always afraid of what I'll find
I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand
I give up
I just wanna get out alive, it's fucked up
At least I can say that I tried
I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand
Did I say thousand? I meant million
Shorty tryna have my kids, gettin' her Billie Jean on

Thinkin' back when I was xanned out on a futon
Coulda OD right there, when a bitch had a couple nosebleeds right there
Juice WRLD, Billy Idol, midnight hour, I'm gon' yell, yell, yell
Too many drugs in my system, I need help, help, help
I only keep people around if they gon' wish me well
'Cause negative energy literally could bring you Hell
I'm worried about you
You ask me if I'm high, I say "Yeah, I took about two" 
Plus two, bet I still fuck you
Prayin' I make it 'til the mornin' by the end of the night
When I wake up, look over at him
He's still so fucked up, I'm always afraid of what I'll find
I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand
I give up
I just wanna get out alive, it's fucked up
At least I can say that I tried
I've been through this a thousand times
I've been through this a thousand

This is my life in a nutshell
This is my life in a nutshell
Heaven's so far away, I'm startin' to love Hell
They know me for my talent, my talent
But don't know how my pain feels
These prescriptions that I fill-ill
Never make the pain heal
Fuck
Back in the lost and found I go
But I'm more lost than found, I know
I feel so cold in L.A. like I'm sittin' back at home, Chicago
They say living's harder than dying, I'm willing to gamble that
Find me unresponsive in a hotel room, girl can you handle that?
Worst case scenario
You still hear my songs on the stereo
You still hear my name on the radio
So I'll live forever, forever
This is my life in a nutshell
Heaven's so far away, I'm startin' to love Hell
They know me for my talent, my talent
But don't know how my pain feels
These prescriptions that I fill-ill
Never make the pain heal
Ho-oh-oh
Death melodies I sing
Cardiac arrest notes
I hate to bring the negative vibes in the room
But that's the ugly truth
So much of my life and time the worlds consumed
I throw the deuce and grab the noose
Onto the next chapter
None of this matters
I've been feelin' helpless
This is my life in a nutshell
Heavens so far away I'm startin' to love Hell
They know me for my talent, my talent
But don't know how my pain feels
These prescriptions that I fill-ill
Never make the pain healI'm too smooth for my own fucking good

Run up then you gettin' tagged Lyrics from Snippets
...'Cause everybody wants me dead
Bitch, I'm already dead
I've been dead for years
You can see the pain in my laugh
Demons coming back from the past...
...All my suffering
It's really getting under my skin
Maybe I should try to pray again
Tryna wash away my sins
I know that they not my friends
But I'm friends with the drugs again
Lost my heart, lost it all
So much drama, hold the applause
Shit's like a soap opera, straight downfalls
Nightmares on the cellphone, late-night calls...It's funny, the shit I put on this song ain’t gon' sound nothin' like the shit we was just doin’
Oh, yeah
I just want bad bitches
Baddest, them bitches is the baddest, uh, uh
When I take the molly, I'm a savage
Uh, I say, uh
I don't need no molly to be savage, uh
When I'm on that molly, I feel savage, uh, uh

Pour the codeine up and put some molly in the cup with it
I know she a freak, uh-huh, she gon’ fuck with it
She my velcro, uh-huh, guess I'm stuck with her
I dive in it like a sailor, I love to nail her
Addicted to her paraphernalia, I had to tell her
I see it like a fortune teller
Your ex-nigga did good, I could do better
Bad bitch from the woods, I think she a hunter
She a killer and an eater, she a Jeffrey Dahmer
She gon' whip it with the beater, she a Betty Crocker
All she care about is money, R.I.P. to Speaker Knockerz
Thinkin 'bout it so much, I forgot to put the hook
I can tell when she in her feelings, I can read her like a book
This is chess, no checkers, I'ma play her like a rook
No TEC, no Beretta, FN on me, am I understood?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't need no molly to be savage, uh
When I'm on that molly, I feel savage, uh, uh

Ayy, my girl the definition of a bad bitch
Stole her heart, I'm the definition of a bandit

I've been drinking, smoking all damn night
Baby, I ain't gonna chase you down

Sippin' Hennessy, I don't needa' chase
Hit the strip club, first hit Chase
Fifty hundred dollar bills from the bank
Rollin' up gas, smokin' on dank
In the club, and I saw your face
Jaw dropped, like my first mix-tape
What's your name?
Asking for that was my first mistake
In my hotel room, my heart you'll break
Lay me on the bed and my soul you'll take
Shake that ass, earth that quake
Finish it all, leave it on your face
Let me take your number down

Lyrics from Leak
Fuck the blunt up, then fuck your momma 
My VVS cold like an arctic tundra
A .40 on me, woah, you don't want no problems
And you best proceed with some caution, yeah
This song for the girl with the blonde hair
Suck me up good, give me becky, like, yeah
She ride it, like, yeah, in a Versace chair
Her boyfriend heated like a grill, no hibachi, yeah
I'm high as hell
Mind everywhere, still mind over matter
Pockets getting fatter, elevate like a ladder
.30 and a .40 make you percolate like a dancer
I'm colder than the North Pole, Blitzen, and Prancer
She say she from the strip pole, she a dirty dancer
Her ex-nigga too low, she don't got no standards
He ain't right, me? I live a better life
Ran it up like Jerry Rice, I don't gotta say it twice
This is real life, your nigga is Fisher-Price
I can read minds, you was thinkin' 'bout her main nigga, right?
Fuck the blunt up then fuck your momma 
My VVS cold like an arctic tundra
.40 on me, woah, you don't want no problems
And you best proceed with some caution, yeah
This song's for the girl with the blonde hair
Suck me up good, give me Becky, like, yeah
She ride it, like, yeah, in a Versace chair
Her boyfriend heated like a grill, no hibachi, yeah
Time, time will tell, I'm sad as hell
Being broke made me sadder
Ran all them bands up, uh, still frownin'
When my world upside down, I'm smilin'
Turn my frown upside down? I doubt it
Like yeah, these are my tales
Sing away my fears, Buzz Lightyears away from here, ayy
Catch me somewhere fuckin' a blunt up
And fuckin' on your momma
Fuck the blunt up then fuck your momma 
My VVS cold like an arctic tundra
.40 on me, woah, you don't want no problems
And you best proceed with some caution, yeah

That lil' bitch a no good woman
I don't want to go there, with her
That lil' bitch a no good woman
I'm calling it quits, I guess I'm a quitter
That lil' bitch a no good woman
I don't want to go there, with her
That lil' bitch a no good woman
I'm calling it quits, I guess I'm a quitter
I guess I'm a quitter
Had to lose you so I could become a winner
Never been God, so no, I'm not a forgiver
I'm a grown lil' man, could fuck on a baby sitter
Life's not fair like Malcolm in the Middle
Oh these bitches really tweakin', skeet and I delete em'
I drink lean by the liter, codeine fever
I got stripes like a tiger but I'm still a cheetah
She don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with me either
Bitch stop, put my heart on the rocks

Ain’t no Batman, bitch, I feel like Bane
Evil running all through my veins
All girls the same
The only thing different is the name
Bitches giving me the same pains
The same headaches
The same na-It's the same old things
I say all the same things
In my mind, they're haunting
The darkness distracts me
'Cause my heart is hurting
Heal it with the money
That don't mean a damn thing, that don't mean a damn thing
I'm fine, I lied
I'm doing all the best things, havin' the worst time
She'll leave soon, almost her time
And I was feelin' real love for the first time
Hate it when she gets like this
Ain't no gettin' to her, ain't no gettin' through her
Lovin' her is a slit to the wrist
Sadness cutting through her, ain't no gettin' to her
I'm fine, I lied
I'm doing all the best things, having the worst time
She'll leave soon, almost her time
And I was feeling real love for the first timeOne hit

She top me up, ain't wanna fuck, she had a fish odor 
Diamonds so big on my wrists, bitch like a wrist boulder 
She gon' fuck me first, why? Because my wrist colder 
Ring around the rosie, pocket full of dead pres'

Get so high, I don't hear what she sayin'
Somethin' 'bout a moon sign, somethin' 'bout a Leo
I'm thinkin' of an orgy, I'm thinkin' of a trio
She'll only cheat on me if you speak creole
Lost in Miami, gotta find her like Nemo
Old dude probably put woo on her, not surprised
Hope she ain't try to put woo on me, I'm not the guy
She don't know what I do with my dark R, it's why I'm higher

I get in a sad mood without my Perky candy

Looked her dead in her soul and I was like
Okay, it's four AM 
I might fall in 
But she not by my side, her I stay calling 
Pussy good, got me hooked, I'm her drug addict 
Fell in love with her like my new Patek 
Tell me what is love, I ain't good at it
But she the type to make a nigga take a crack at it 
Girl, give me my fix, crack addict
I said, "Bitch, give me my fix, I'm a crack addict" 
Okay bae, excuse my French 
You not no bitch, but you my bitch, just how it is 
A bad bitch at that

Pussy is power and , you're powerful as shit, love 
I fuck her with my eyes closed, then I feel her
I open up my eyes, woah, overwhelmingly close
Don't keep them legs closed, let me in, love
You are my drug, and I'm tryna catch a overdose
Can you feel it? 'Cause I know damn well I can feel it 
You can ride me, pop you a wheelie 
I mean you did say you was from Philly, right? 
You do got me in my feelings, right 
You always have me feeling right 
You mixing my dick with liquor, right? 
You love it when I lick it, right?

Fell in love with her like my new Patek 
Tell me what is love, I ain't good at it
But she the type to make a nigga take a crack at it 
Girl, give me my fix, crack addict
I said, "Bitch, give me my fix, I'm a crack addict" 
A fear of falling in love, but you make it easy for me
A spear right through your heart, signed by Cupid and yours truly
We want no smoke, I'ma pill pop, fuck a doobie
Phone out when we make love, makin' movies
I go back and watch 'em every time you're not near me
Record us on a new iPhone so I can see it clearly
You having a twin is the only way that I'm cheating
L-O-L, I'm joking, let me stop playin' before you kill me
No syrup, no pills, no smoke, that's the real me
Off two percs, look like I'm shooting dope up, you feel me?
I say that to say that you give me the same feeling
Momma said you good for me, get a thumbs up from my family
I pray that, I pray that we have a happy ending
Holy matrimony, even though we always sinning 
Okay, it's four AM 
I might fall in 
But she not by my side, her I stay calling 
Pussy good, got me hooked, I'm her drug addict 
Fell in love with her like my new Patek

No more drugs, I caught a fever
She don't know me, I don't either
It's been a while since I been this gone
It's been a while since she turned me on
Old hoes, comin' back in the present
Open up like a present
It's been a while since I sang this song
It's been a while since I hit your phone
Past hoes comin' back in the present
She don't love me, she say I'm a loser
How can I lose, when I fucked on my tutor
I told her to hold my Ruger
Cause when twelve comes, she'll be the loser
It's been a while since I've seen your face
It's been a while since I've been this wasted, Hennessy the remedy
Lookin' in the mirror and I'm startin' to see my enemy
It's been a while since I've been this wrong
It's been a while since you've turned me on
Liquor bringin' memories
Tryna fight the devil for some inner peace
She wears short skirts, she's a keeper
She don't love me, I don't either
No more drugs, I caught a fever
She don't know me, I don't either
It's been a while since I been this gone
It's been a while since she turned me on

Don’t go, don't go
Take my hand, I will never be alone
Don't go, don't go, oh
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

Sew your mouth shut, you don't got shit to fucking say
Get all that hypocrisy the fuck out my face
Breakdowns every fucking day 
Energy getting taken away
Drug use got me in a daze 
Praying it helping it go away
Like what the fuck
Why the fuck? When the fuck?
How the fuck did I get so fucked up?

Pushin' the states back, lookin' at the city
This shit look brazy, nigga, uh
Alright, haha
Double cup when I—
Double cup when I wake up, Actavis a life-taker
Probably meetin' my maker, smokin' exotic flavors
If I tote the shotty, I'ma blow the shotty
Then I walk around like I don't know nobody
Upstairs, groupies waitin' in the lobby
Got a girlfriend, sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't come to kick it with any of these bitches
See money I been gettin'
I fuck up a check, let it blown in the wind
Bitch, check my quarter, I been gettin' bolder and better than all of these niggas that's bussin'
If it's a problem, my niggas will clutch it
Pretty niggas still shoot up the function
Top of the line, I got my hand on my nine
Bitch, I'ma die about mine
I was told life was about elevations, just pick you a ladder, and start-up the climb
Can't be afraid to take risk after risk, gamble chip after chip, tryna stay on the grind
Was in the kitchen, cook grits, but they weren't really grits, they were bricks, mom, I'm sorry, I lied
I can make it up to you this time
Bought my mom a car, she listen to my shit while she drive
I owe her the world, send disrespect her way, you gotta die
Same way 'bout my girl, them diamonds make 'em twinkle like her eyes
Oh, it's one thing to talk about it, another thing to do it
Oh, it's one thing to talk about it, another thing to do it
It's one thing to talk about it, another thing to do it
It's one thing to talk about it, another thing to do it
Breakin' pills down, I can't help it, it's a habit now
Pipe the fuck up, turnt the fuck up, promise ain't no comin' down
You get burnt the fuck up, choppers on us if you came to fuck around
Look for your mom, she in town, givin' head for some brown
I'm a dog off the leash, bitch, I bite, I don't growl
I don't bark, I'm in silence, I'ma shoot up the crowd
If he want smoke, give him cancer, I'm gon' blow him down
He ain't know it was a problem, then I bet he know it's a problem now
I came from the trenches, was plottin' on riches, I made it, I did it

My mama know I suffer from addiction
She like my father, she hopin' I was different
But I ain't trippin', I know my sins ain't forgiven
I ain't Kodak, baby, I got more than tunnel vision
Broke up with the drugs but I think I need them right now
Secrets that I can't keep right now
Confessions, it's a curse and a blessing
They say your word is your weapon
My grandma probably think that I'm demonic, huh
Shit, I am, let's be honest
Eyes red when I walk into the crib, ayy, ayy
Die later, what am I on?
Mixing pills with the potions
Like a present on Christmas, let me open, ayy, ayy
Caught me in the open
Demons like gangsters, they catch me, they gon' smoke on me
I'm in hell, I inhale
How am I? Bitch, I ain't feelin' well
Can you tell? This is not a sad face
I'm having a good day, sarcastic
Pops called my phone, I was flabbergasted
'Cause I don't have no pops, I'm a bastard
And I don't have no friends
They only come around for a good time not when it matters
My mama know I suffer from addiction
She like my father, she hopin' I was different
But I ain't trippin', I know my sins ain't forgiven
I ain't Kodak, baby, I got more than tunnel vision

Pull up like Paul Walker, R.I.P. for life, fast forward, uh

Then again, I got that crack, Lamar OD, uh, ayy
Niggas think they know me, know me
Courtside with a bride, she still catching nose bleeds
But that's none of my business, I'm a rap murderer

Smokin the O.Z., feel like I'm a wizard, uh
You don't know me, but I'm that nigga, uh

Like bitch what are you on
Hit me on my trap phone, uh
Grew up robbing, had to take a bad phone
What you on?
You don't want no problem, I'm on that bullshit
I dye my hair like Dennis Rodman
I got a full clip, it works, not afraid to pop it
Feel like Drake “Headlines,“ started from the bottom
Magnum in my pocket, that's a gun or a condom
Gotta protect myself and I gotta wrap up that anaconda
Pull up, that's okay, I swear to God you want no problem
Like a milli' or something, I'm a goon
What's a goon to a fucking goblin
What's a goblin to a god
And what's a god without a goddess
I'm talking about my girl, ain't being humble, fuck the modest
But then again, at the end of the day
I'm thankful for all my shit, bitch
Life is but a journey
And I'm writing out my wish list
Uh, uh, uh-uhI'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long 
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song 
Ain't no telling where we'll end up 
Last night was a blur, so, girl, I wasn't sure
If we made love or if we made something more
Last thing I remember is me walking out the door
Next thing you know woke up on the floor 
I don't know whose house this is, but I know I'm in Hollywood
Scrambled for my keys, then I stumbled to the car
I look in the backseat, what do I see?
Bro passed out, layin' next to a bad bra
Looks like they had a good time
I must've too, 'cause for some reason I can't remember my night
Reach in my pockets, what do I find?
Half a Percocet, two hundred dollars, and a weed pipe
That's when somebody hit my phone line
Sayin', "Yesterday was wild,“ askin' if I'm alright
I don't know what happened, but I wanna know
I guess we gotta do it all over again tonight
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up
Here we go again, woke up in a bed
But it wasn't my bed, whose is this?
Vision kinda blurry, I can't see shit
Wrapped around my body, I see two tattooed hands
Last night more blank than the night before
At least I made it to a bed, last time I woke up on the floor
All I could remember is a bitch screaming, "More, more, more, more"
Videos on my phone, we were in a high-speed chase in a white Rolls
Looks like we threw them hands too
Here's a clue: knuckles bruised, and somebody else's blood on my elbow
Lately I've been blacking out, drugs getting too strong
Buying all the pills from the plug, money too long
I get high to let go and find out where I belong
Probably by my VLONE, party with my demons
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end upMurda on the beat so it's not nice!
I ain't have love in a minute 
I've been on drugs for a minute 
I ain't hit my plug in a minute 
Lately, I've been drownin' in my feelings 
I ain't have love in a minute 
I've been on drugs for a minute 
I ain't hit my plug in a minute 
Lately, I've been drownin' in my feelings 
Takeoff 
When I'm in my feelings 
I bought me some codeine, just so I can't feel it 
No doc or nurse, a pharmacy, needed the way I'm prescriptin' 
Pray I don't get cursed, rebukin' the demons with the Holy Spirit 
And I was makin' it work, before I had fame, I had to go get it 
I'm down to run up some M&M's, my niggas you wit' it 
The cash, the racks, the bags, if you sendin' M's, my nigga you get it 
You tryna fuck with the rocket, what's in your pocket better come wit' it 
Run around, tellin' somebody, behind me, first to be murdered had did it 
Don't know what you heard but they lyin'
If I ain't the greatest, then who is you kiddin'? 
I go and put on a piece of my jewelry, my definition of chillin' 
Ain't been in love in a minute so baby, I'm sorry if I lose the feeling 
They want us to stop taking drugs but ain't nobody stoppin' the killing 
I ain't have love in a minute 
I've been on drugs for a minute 
I ain't hit my plug in a minute 
Lately, I've been drownin' in my feelings 
I ain't have love in a minute 
I've been on drugs for a minute 
I ain't hit my plug in a minute 
Lately, I've been drownin' in my feelings 
Lately, I've been drownin' in my feelings
She don't give me problems when she swallowin' my children
Talk behind my back, then you go try and play the victim
Like you couldn't talk to me all the times we was chillin'
I don't want to feel this pain, guess some people never change
I got my head in the rain, double cups and Mary Jane
We don't look at life the same, deep depression in my brain
I would give my life for you, just so you see better days
I wake up sad, I can't wait to go to bed
I got demons in my head, tryna leave me left for dead
I battle with myself about the things I never said
She told me that she love me and I left her ass on read
She be tryna ball hard in the scrimmage
Then I tell you I don't care about practice
Run a full court press on a mattress
In the strip club, throwin' dubs, she hit back flips
I ain't have love in a minute 
I've been on drugs for a minute 
I ain't hit my plug in a minute 
Lately, I've been drownin' in my feelings 
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ohSo many drugs in my body, I'm exhausted
I got thugs in the lobby, in the club, fuck your posse
Fuck with me, I leave you sitting in a coffin
Bullets eating up your body, one to the head, now you silent
I remember window shopping, now I cop shit
So much Gucci in my closet, banded up fuck a wallet
All my fans telling me that I should drop shit
What you want? I got options, fifty albums in my pocket
Artist of the motherfucking year
People scream my name from London to Japan
Codeine sip, I don’t want no fucking beer
Everywhere I go, they know I'm the fucking man
I get so high I won't ever land
LA in the summertime, get a fucking tan
But I don’t go outside at all
That shit be having my girl pissed off
Sorry, I'm antique, but for her love I'm antsy
Everyday wanna get in her panties
Every night in the stu' making Grammies
Just gave fifty bands to my mommy
Just gave ten bands to my auntie
You couldn't do that if you worked your whole life
I know why you're worried 'bout me, nigga, you don't got your own life
Hollering at my bitch like you ain’t got your own wife
They tell me if I take too many of these Percs, then I’m gon' die
Fuck it, I’ma pray to god for a long life
Still gon' live a wrong life
So many drugs in my body, I'm exhausted
I got thugs in the lobby, in the club, fuck your posse
Fuck with me, I leave you sitting in a coffin
Bullets eating up your body, one to the head, now you silent
I remember window shopping, now I cop shit
So much Gucci in my closet, banded up fuck a wallet
All my fans telling me that I should drop shit
What you want? I got options, fifty albums in my pocket
Artist of the motherfucking year
People scream my name from London to Japan
Codeine sip, I don't want no fucking beer
Everywhere I go, they know I’m the fucking man
I get so high I won't ever land
LA in the summertime, get a fucking tan
But I don't go outside at allNine, nine, nine
Sometimes I feel different 
Ayy, he don't want no problems unless he got bitches 
Okay, uh 
Really feel myself but sometimes I feel different 
I'm feelin' myself but sometimes I feel different 
Always been myself but sometimes I feel different 
Uh, uh, ooh woah
I always been myself but sometimes I feel different 
I got it all but it feel like it's something missing 
I came a long way from skipping school and smoking Swishers  
Used to keep a .40 that'll clean a nigga dirty dishes 
Now I got a gun that'll beam 'em up like Scotty did it 
Banana clip’ll go and eat 'em up, over the monkey business 
She tell me that she'll do whatever I want, she just wanna be with me 
I told her I don't want none of the fake love she try to give me
I don't want it, I don't want it
But I never run and my heart tougher than bricks
Okay it's not tougher than bricks
Actually it's brittle as shit
But me admitting that to you, was about as tough as it gets
She told me that she love me
She think I'm gon' fuck her for it
Every girl tell me she love me
I ain't finna fuck 'em for it
But since we on the topic of discussion, go ahead and fuck my boys
And you ain't fucking 'em right, if you ain't in the room makin' noise
I met this ho today on a boat and frankly I'm still annoyed
I'm tryna enjoy the water and this bitch was makin' me feel annoyed
She almost fought my girl
Almost got beat up like my girl a boy
That's the end of my daily story, I'm gon' make you pay me for it
Oh-oh-oh
Time is such a great thing
It gives you the chance to wipe the slate clean
Percs have my brain weak
I cried hard this evening
Keep the feelings
We may die this evening
I always been myself but sometimes I feel different 
I got it all but it feel like it's something missing 
I came a long way from skipping school and smoking Swishers  
Used to keep a .40 that'll clean a nigga dirty dishes 
Now I got a gun that'll beam 'em up like Scotty did it 
Banana clip’ll go and eat 'em up, over the monkey business 
She tell me that she'll do whatever I want, she just wanna be with me 
I told her I don't want none of the fake love she try to give me
I see it, all like I'm omniscient
Sometimes I can't see it all, I ain't omniscient
Time to leave, "Bon voyage", nigga, good riddance
I wrap cement around his leg, it's time to go fishing
Get high as fuck, no comin' down 
I really need to calm down 
These Percocet get me signed out 
They may knock my lights out 
They pipe me up and pipe down 
To the plane, need a time out 
They say you fuck my mans 
Baby don't let me find out 
This ain't a rental, I hop in the Lambo and drive like a criminal
I'm gettin' more bread than a basket of dinner rolls
Dead rose, I ball out like Derrick Rose
I just spent 20K on Melrose
Came a long way from wearing shell toes
Diamonds on me and they wetter than water
Speakin' of water I'm fresh off a sailboat
I've been up in my matrix
I've been gettin' high, faded
Blue pills take me to different places
Rearrangin', screwin' my brain in
I always been myself but sometimes I feel different 
I got it all but it feel like it's something missing 
I came a long way from skipping school and smoking Swishers  
Used to keep a .40 that'll clean a nigga dirty dishes 
Now I got a gun that'll beam 'em up like Scotty did it 
Banana clip’ll go and eat 'em up, over the monkey business 
She tell me that she'll do whatever I want, she just wanna be with me 
I told her I don't want none of the fake love she try to give meI don't wanna rush

I know that it’s love

I don't wanna rush
But I already rushed it, so fuck it
I know that it’s love

We too busy focused on depression
Damn, I can't really focus under pressure
Damn, I ain't know that you were such a druggie
It's ironic cause you're the one that’s addicting
It’s ironic cause you're the piece that I’m missing
And you say that I'm the piece that make ends meet
Damn, still get' no peace, still get no sleep
Every time you work for me, promise you won't play with me
They told me to stay away, I told you to stay with me
Pack your bags, pretty ass, come live in LA with me
I don’t wanna rush
But I already rushed it, so fuck it
I know that it's love
But I'm also lust, and I love it 
I don't wanna rush

Niggas always gon' be mad 
Yeah, you know? 
I feel like Terry Crews 
How I flex on a nigga, he should be embarrassed 
Walk in a party, the jeans is Amiri 
Off of the Perkys, I'm feeling delirious 
Almost threw up on the Burberry 
Itching and scratching, the tweak is heavy 
That don't stop me from counting fetty 
Bullet hit him in his eye, he Fetty 
Shouldn’t have said that, fuck it, I'm petty 
He got jumped in the club, they thought we was barbarians 
After that, he ain't want beef, he went vegetarian 
Call the bouncer Mariah 'cause he had to carry him 
Call me undertaker 'cause I had to bury him 
Call his bitch a sucker 'cause she had to marry him 
Went to HF but I fucked the bitches from Marian 
I can't bool with a pussy, you bool with a rat 
But these lil' niggas keep Tommy & Jerry-ing 
I was up in Japan and before that in Paris 
With bitches we fuck without having to marry 'em 
Fuck a Asian bitch, she screaming in Mandarin 
I’m calling my side ho, I'm feeling scandalous 
It's funny 'cause like all them niggas that be talking shit
When I see them they just be like
Sitting ducks, sitting ducks 
Sitting ducks, sitting ducks 
Pullin' up, all I see is sitting ducks
Pull it out, let it go, they sitting ducks
Sitting ducks, sitting ducks 
Sitting ducks, sitting ducks

Lil' brody got the .40, he'll smoke you like a dutch
Smoke you like a Backwood
I don't roll doja, I do barewoods
Chasin' the purp I'm in love with the muddy 
I'm diggin' her but I'm in love with her buddy 
Don't need no molly, they already ready 
Don't need no Bill Cosby, they already ready 
Niggas be jealous, that's over the fetty 
They try me I'm turnin' their brain spaghetti 
I'ma skate on this block like Wayne Gretzky 
My bank account like Lil Wayne, a milli' 
My momma told me, this fame, it'll kill me 
Find me Perc'd out in an abandoned building 
I'm running this shit like a mile a minute 
Uh huh, run on a road to riches 
You say you real, that's a fairy-tale 
Like a make-out session with toads and bitches 
Black excellence at its finest , it feel like Martin Luther and Ruby Bridges 
I caught your mans ridin' round with his bitch , tool on me like, ooh he slippin' 
Terry will shoot it like, ooh, we killed him 
Let the clip off like a movie film 
I'm an older soul so I fuck on a MILF 
Banana clip on me, I aim it at chimp 
.40 got me walking just like a pimp 
You didn't get that, that means that I limp 
I'm in love with a JUUL and her flavor is mint 
They didn't think I was gonna say that shit, but I did 
That bitch think I tricked her, but "Trix are for kids" 
I thought it was only grown women in here 
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Back to the fuck nigga portion of the song

I can't breathe , I can't breathe, 999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh, well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Ring-ring, phone call from depression
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line, I talk to addiction, huh
Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them
This can't be real, is it fiction?
Somethin' feels broke, need to fix it
I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh, well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

Let's be for real
If it wasn't for the pills, I wouldn't be here
But if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah
I just told y'all my secret, yeah
It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me
They took the wheel and then they drove me crazy
Got me reminiscing, hyperventilating
Prescriptions like a doctor, never been a patient
Never had the patience for all of this crazy shit
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh, well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill

Fell in love with you I ain't mean to
Jaw dropped to the floor first time I seen you
Said you were coming to L.A. couldn't wait to meet you
I'm obsessed for real, no pretend, ooh
Let's hit the bedroom, we got shit to tend to
I can feel my heart jump every time I see you
Got me feelin' cerebral, damn girl I need you
I'm so glad we ain't meet back in high school
Don't need to see what I've been through
Let me drown in your love, leave me consumed
Just don't walk me to my doom
I don't ever let nobody walk in my room
You're up in my room
You're somebody that I could always confide to
When there ain't nowhere to turn
You got my back when my back is against the wall
I love that, I don't like that at all
I love that, I don't like that at all
Yeah, you got my back when my back is against the wall
I love that, I don't like that at all

No matter the weather
She call me whenever
I told her she could call me whenever
I told her she could call me whenever no matter the weather
I'm falling apart, I need to get it together
You lie, you lie, when you say it’s forever
Can't lie, I'm high, it ain’t getting no better
I give her all of my effort, she say it's whatever
I should've put effort in finding somebody better
Now I'm hung like a hook, sing this song forever
No pun intended but these words are a little too clever
I'm in the bushes while she walk home
I'm her secret admirer, stalking is such a strong term
I'm in your bedroom when you're not home
Love is obsession, when the hell will I learn
You never meant to hurt me, right?
I hope that that’s what you’re thinking
You say you got a new man, right?
I have to make him go missing
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking
Narcotic nonsense, I’m tweaking
There's a hole in my heart, that shit leaking
Just hold me close and kill the pain
I told her she could call me whenever no matter the weather
I'm falling apart, I need to get it together
You lie, you lie, when you say it's forever
Can’t lie, I'm high, it ain't getting no better
I give her all of my effort, she say it's whatever
I should've put effort in finding somebody better
Now I'm hung like a hook, sing this song forever
No pun intended but these words are a little too clever
I'm hung, I'm hung, I'm young, I'm dumb
In love, I'm sprung, can't hold my tongue
Wanna shout out to my fans, I know you worry
In my Instagram comments asking who hurt me
I'm in my feelings over bitches that are doing me dirty
I can still see your shadows in my room, baby
You just hit me the other day, a little too flirty
I know you don't want me, you want my money, honey
You can't put a price on love
You can't put a price on us
I told her she could call me whenever no matter the weather
I'm falling apart, I need to get it together
You lie, you lie, when you say it's forever
Can't lie, I'm high, it ain't getting no better
I give her all of my effort, she say it's whatever
I should've put effort in finding somebody better
Now I'm hung like a hook, sing this song forever
No pun intended but these words are a little too cleverI know the secrets to you, baby
You say the drugs, they drive me crazy
I don't believe a word you say
You're the one that's drivin' me insane
No more getting in my way
No more ruining my day
No more getting in my way
No more ruining my day
I fly high, on planes
Crash down, but I am not afraid
Lost in life, like a maze
I'm so high, I'm amazed
That you were still walkin' through my brain
Killing me and driving me insane
I don't know why you won't go away
You're just another problem that I face
Speakin' of face, I can't feel my
You've been away for such a long time
Keep tellin' myself that it's alright
Keep tellin' myself, but it's all lies
Keep tellin' myself that it's alright
Speakin' of face, I can't feel my
Speakin' of face, I can't feel my
I know the secrets to you, baby
You save the drugs, to drive me crazy
I don't believe a word you say
You're the one that's drivin' me insane
No more getting in my way
No more ruining my day
No more getting in my way
No more ruining my day

When it's dark outside, you're always the light 
This heart of mine was once cold as the ice 
The more I try, the more I open my mind, for you
To find, the demons hidin' deep inside
Fuck, I owe fines, the devil say I owe him for life
But I could feel it, I got God on my side
Remember when He sent you to me that night
Had to cuff you up, like a cop on a heist
Cupid is the judge, so I must testify
I won't move or budge, I'll stand by you for life
All my life, when you die is when I die
I sometimes wonder why
We argue and fight
And quickly make things right
It's probably 'cause we gotta grow more over time
Wouldn't be real love without rough nights
Can't feel these drugs, but I feel your eyes
When you look at mine, things feel alright
When it's dark outside, you're always the light 
This heart of mine was once cold as the ice 
The more I try, the more I open my mind, for you
To find, the demons hidin' deep inside
Been through it, I don't really wanna get into it
Throwin' out your heart to break mine, so I won't do it
Also baby, you're my lifeline, you're an influence
All the times you was mad, I was over under the influence
I feel sorry for the people that don't get it
It's really rare that you feel the real love feelin'
Some people get hurt and never love again
Some people get hurt and give the drugs a binge
Some people get dressed and go and hit the club to mend
There's no love in one-night stands, but you can play pretend
And me, I'ma admit it
All of these hoes one thing, that's pretentious
And if I know one thing, then I know this
It's us forever, worse or better, no discussion
That's how I'm comin'
When it's dark outside, you're always the light 
This heart of mine was once cold as the ice 
The more I try, the more I open my mind, for you
To find, the demons hidin' deep insideCodeine guzzler, on another level

She knows that I love her , I hope she knows that my love is real 
I want this forever, fosho', sho'
And I love her for real, not for show, show
Only time will tell on her if her heart's wrong
Only time, but I know she's mine
Okay, listen again

Tattooed in ink, every time that I see, it reminds me

Now I'm drowning in your love like ten feet
To the planets align when you kiss me
Show your freaky lil' side and lick me up
When I'm down you are my pick me up
You know this codeine gon' tear me up
I'm pouring the whole thing, my mind is eroding
You pissed and I know it
You tell me that I gotta make better choices
Oh 
I'm taking my time, cause this is the time

I ain't wanna be the one to say it's over, but bitch, it's over
It's over, bitch, it's over
It's o-over, bitch, it's over
Ain't no lullabies, just nightmares, just nightmares

It's over
It's over, bitch, it's over
It's o-over, bitch, it's over
Bitch, it's over, heyAll through the midnight hours
Running from my fears, shit I feel like a coward
Kryptonite killed all of my superpowers
My anxiety builds, I jump off the stress tower
Reaching for the pills, I take Opiate showers
Growing from my sins that I'm planting in flowers
Devil got me snorting lines of enchantment powder
Life is a bitch and her lips taste sour
I find it fascinating that I'm high off my own supply
Buckle up it's gon' be a long ride
Knuckle up, these demons came to fight 
Run 'em up, up, up, cause a ruckus 
Had enough, 'nough, 'nough, screaming fuck this 
Yeah, fuck this all
Life gets dirty, time for the Lysol
Making crucial mistakes, yeah I know it's my fault
You hate to look at my face, yeah I know it's my fault
You don't gotta tell me, I know I'm the cause
Surgery is needed put away the gauze
All through the midnight hours
Running from my fears, shit I feel like a coward
Kryptonite killed all of my superpowers
My anxiety builds, I jump off the stress tower
Reaching for the pills, I take Opiate showers
Growing from my sins that I'm planting in flowers
Devil got me snorting lines of enchantment powder
Life is a bitch and her lips taste sour
Sometimes life flies over my head, yeah
It's out of my hands, yeah, hard to comprehend that
I thought of money, you still got on calling it quits
Went out the misery business, cause I can't take it
Things ain't what they seem, they think it's easy to be me
I never let them see me bleed, I only let them see peace
Things ain't what they seem, they think it's easy to be me
I never let them see me bleed, nor see me in pieces
I'm getting used to opening up to people around me
I know that they're my family, they would do anything to help me
But they still don't know everything that is going on inside of me
Even I don't know all the places my demons are hiding
All through the midnight hours
Running from my fears, shit I feel like a coward
Kryptonite killed all of my superpowers
My anxiety builds, I jump off the stress tower
Reaching for the pills, I take Opiate showers
Growing from my sins that I'm planting in flowers
Devil got me snorting lines of enchantment powder
Life is a bitch and her lips taste sourMachete

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
But it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed

Thoughts of a wedding ring

I wonder all the time if I will live to see tomorrow
I can't escape demise, the lies the guilt, they always follow
And almost all the time, nobody's here, I walk with shadows
I deal with a lot at a young age
These drugs startin' to rot out my brain
See, let me tell you somethin' about pain
Walking in sadness, living in madness
I know a lot a people ain't okay
Locked up in their emotions, no cage
The end of the world could just be a bad day
Life is a drag race when you're in last place
Everyone has those times
Everyone has those days
Just make it up in your mind
That you'll be okay
I always been the type to be alone and drown in sorrows
I wonder all the time if I will live to see tomorrow
I can't escape demise, the lies the guilt, they always follow
And almost all the time, nobody's here, I walk with shadows
Everyone has those times
Everyone has those days
Just make it up in your mind
That you'll be okay
Always been the type to be alone and drown in sorrows
I wonder all the time if I will live to see tomorrow

She told me put my heart in the bag 
And nobody gets hurt 
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast 
So I'm making it worse 
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person 
It's a gift and a curse 
But I cannot reverse it
You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
She told me put my heart in the bag 
And nobody gets hurt 
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast 
So I'm making it worse 
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person 
It's a gift and a curse 
But I cannot reverse it
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, "You loved me first" 
One thing my dad told me was, "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
"Flex on a ho every time they're insecure"
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? 
Is your love really true?
She told me put my heart in the bag 
And nobody gets hurt 
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast 
So I'm making it worse 
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person 
It's a gift and a curse 
But I cannot reverse itOn God, you hear him?

Let's goEdsclusive
IBeatz
Girl where did you go?
I am so alone
Thinkin' 'bout the day when you woke up in my arms
Now that you're away, feel like I'm falling apart
Cross hearts take my soul
Coax me, hold me close
Eye contact, mind control, oh-oh-oh-oh
Hypnotized, I am
I don't give a damn
Antisocial, yeah
Here we go again
Listening to Blink-182 while I fuck her
Like a Roman Trojan on a rubber
Niggas think they funny, no Chris Tucker
Try'na break bread, no last supper
But back to the point, shorty got me on point
Light me up like a joint, while we smokin' a joint
And take the walk through the forest, you know the view super gorgeous
Enough about us, back to the chorus
Girl where did you go?
I am so alone
Thinkin' 'bout the day when you woke up in my arms
Now that you're away, feel like I'm falling apart
Cross hearts take my soul
Coax me, hold me close
Eye contact, mind control, oh-oh-oh-oh
You are my overdose
Too many drugs, overload
I keep on letting go, go, go, go, go
She know what makes me feel like she take my breath away
Can't breathe, breathe
Why you leave me to cry?
Why you leave me to die, die?
Girl where did you go?
I am so alone
Thinkin' 'bout the day when you woke up in my arms
Now that you're away, feel like I'm falling apart
Cross hearts take my soul
Coax me, hold me close
Eye contact, mind control, oh-oh-oh-ohWorkin' everyday, it's non-stop
Gotta stop 
Fuck nigga, stop 
Workin' everyday, it's non-stop, gotta get it
If a nigga look close, see the Glock in my fitted
If I ever go broke, I'ma rob me a nigga
But I'll never go broke, I'ma die with bank rolls
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la 
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
Money is the motive, but it's not everything to me
Ten million quota and my prices still rising
Fightin' off depression, I need money for my army
Percs cost, lean cost, weed cost, army
I'ma numb the pain, you can't see it on me 
It's in my veins, always been lonely 
But to the world, I'm a different story 
They payin' me just to tell my story 
Been talkin' to god, and I'm battle ready 
I wonder what the devil finna try to tell me 
I already inhaled, when I was in hell 
Flames in my lungs, fire in my belly 
Workin' everyday, it's non-stop, gotta get it
If a nigga look close, see the Glock in my fitted
If I ever go broke, I'ma rob me a nigga
But I'll never go broke, I'ma die with bank rolls
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la 
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
Bury me alive, in these blue faces
When I can't feel my face, it's my favorite
Don't like psychedelics no more, but I'll take a trip
Catchin' vibes off the percs, tell the world catch my drift
Gettin' lit like a candle, Hanukkah
Feel like the president, where's Monica?
Feels like my demons have a grip on my poor soul
They hold me close, it makes me cold
Now there's ice inside my home
I can't survive in there alone
Gotta lot of money in my bank account
Still don't keep me warm from the cold
Workin' everyday, it's non-stop, gotta get it
If a nigga look close, see the Glock in my fitted
If I ever go broke, I'ma rob me a nigga
But I'll never go broke, I'ma die with bank rolls
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la 
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-laI hope, I

I could feel it in my brain 
I could feel it in my veins 
Perfect feelings all the way 
Perc ceilings, purple rain 
It's a dark road that I pave 
Taking narcos to the grave 
Feelin' real good, but not ashamed 
But I still can't feel my face 
Pills, cigarette thrills, nicotine kills
So does being stuck in my feels
I know drugs are wrong but still
I take them just so I can shake those
Demons off me, as I lay in a coffin
If I don't pop these then I won't be talkin'
The elephant in the room every time that I walk in
It gets annoying, without drugs I can't breathe
Its hard for me to leave
They tell me that its easy to quit-it, funny coming from someone that's not dealing with it-it
Wait, I'm getting a call from my dealer again
He tell me these are the strong ones
They tell me that its easy to quit-it, funny coming from someone that's not dealing with it-it
Wait, I'm getting a call from my dealer again
I could feel it in my brain 
I could feel it in my veins 
Perfect feelings all the way 
Perc ceilings, purple rain 
It's a dark road that I pave 
Taking narcos to the grave 
Feelin' real good, but not ashamed 
But I still can't feel my face Lyrics from Snippets

I hope the memories we make last all life long, yeah
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up
Daytrip took it to ten, hey
Last night was a blur, so girl, I wasn't sure
If we made love or if we made something more
Last thing I remember is me walking out the door
Next thing you know woke up on the floor 
I don't know whose house this is but I know I'm in Hollywood
Scrambled for my keys, then I stumbled to the car
I look in the backseat, what do I see?
Bro passed out, layin' next to a bad broad
Looks like they had a good time, I must've too
'Cause for some reason I can't remember my night
Reach in my pockets, what do I find?
Half a Percocet, two hundred dollars and a weed pipe
That's when somebody hit my phone line
Sayin', "Yesterday was wild," asking if I'm alright
I don't know what happened, but I wanna know
I guess we gotta do it all over again tonight
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up
Here we go again
Woke up in a bed
But it wasn't my bed, whose is this?
Vision kinda blurry, I can't see shit
Wrapped around my body, I see two tattooed hands
Last night more blank than the night before
At least I made it to a bed, last time I woke up on the floor
Only could remember is a bitch screaming, "More, more, more, more"
Videos on my phone we were in a high speed chase in a white Rolls
Looks like we threw them hands too
Here's a clue, knuckles bruised and somebody elses blood on my elbow
Lately I been blacking out, drugs getting too strong
Buying all the pills from the plug, money too long
I get high to let go and find out where I belong
Probably by my Vlone
Party with my demons
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end upHuh, huh
I don't even know that nigga
Uh, ya dig?

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck, uh
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh
I'm off the Percs, you don't condone it
You say it makes me act atrocious
But I can't stand life when I'm sober
Take my heart, I'll hand it over
Six months in, it gets colder
I don't want us to be over
Let's make love 'til we die
And let's fuck until we slump over
Be my first, I know that you hate to see me bleed
I don't deserve your love, I tend to fuck up everything
It feels like I'm not enough, no, no, no
This a conversation, not a love song
Woah, we met in a Twilight Zone
I fall apart but she keep me whole
We met on the West Coast
But I still see Miami in your soul
Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name

Drop dead to the floor, you're gorgeous
Pedal to the floor, I floor it
As I run over all the clothes you left at my place
We met on MySpace, I loved your face
Invited you to my place, it went down in my place
That's where it all went wrong, now I'm trying to write my wrongs
You had to go and break my heart, now I gotta make this song
Bitch, fuck you, hate you for life
I made a mistake tryna make you my wife
Slit from a blade full of pain, full of hate
Take 21 cuts, like bitch it's a knife
Now you say I'm tripping, right?
Things should've ended up different, right?
Really should've kept my distance
Now I gotta set fire to your house, watch it burn in the distance
Yeah, dumb bitch, I don't care
I hope that you die scared, knowing I'm not there
Got no interest in ya
I don't wanna talk no more, uh
Think I'll just ignore ya

Toxic kisses off the Xans
Bad Romance...

...Back of the car with the blunt to her lips
Never ever thought that I'd be getting high off a kiss
Grown man, heart-broke I thought Trix were for kids
Now I’m really thinking I won't find a lover again
You lied when you told me that you want it forever
I ball no matter the weather, it's forever
Another toxic love like, not again
Wash it down with klonopins
Give me one chance, let me...Earl on the beatLousy

I really hope it was no lying 'cause my heart breaks
It feels like the world's gone
But if the love's real, you'd feel your soul roar like a lion
And you'd finally let bygones be bygones
Don't throw in the towel, I know it feels like you're the only one trying
You just gotta learn to live and love on
Uh, sometimes life's a mess 
I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love didn't click
Searching for somethin' real, then I found it
Uh-uh, sometimes life's a mess
Yeah, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love ain't click
Looking for somethin' real, then I found it
Been pretty fuckin' bad, well it's better now
Through the trials and tribulations, I found my way out
Feel all of the good and bad vibrations all around
All around us, they surround us
Was a lost cause, with some lost love
It ain't my fault, pain chose us, then I found her
My whole world turned upside down, uh
But for the better
I belong with the one put on this earth for me
Everybody has their someone, just gotta look and see
I'm screaming out, "Lord, help me, I've been lonely"
That's when you accept me
Then you set me free

Put away money and burn all the rest
Up for days, I ain't get no rest
It's just me and this Kel-Tec
Back in the day, Trueys and J's
Criminal ways, droppin' them setsYeah
This one for all the people that believe in me
We gon' make it there
Juice
Juice
You still at the bottom
I’m still at the bottom, I'm not goin' anywhere
I’m chasin' the stardom, might happen tomorrow
Just hold on, I know we gon' make it there
We could look in the past and just drop it
But if you gon' keep it, I guess we could take it there
They say life is a game, well if that is the case
Then I guess I'm just not gone' be playing fair
You still at the bottom
I'm still at the bottom, I'm not goin’ anywhere
I’m chasin' the stardom, might happen tomorrow

They say life is a game, well if that is the case
Then I guess I'm just not gone' be playing fair
Fuck everybody, they hate me
Hold hands and jump off of that fucking cliff
I’ma start off by answering unanswered questions
The answer is no, you can't fuck with this
 But you don't have to
Let's cut to the chase, I'ma God of a rapper 
And when I say "cut to the chase"
I mean runoff and hope I don't stab you
Hope I don't have to fuckin' attack you
Spittin' more ink than a motherfuckin' tattoo
Bitch, I'm not bashful
Bitch, I will bash you
You just a sack to my tackle
I'm just a rapper with wrappin's
Wrappin' this rap up in raps
So I guess I'm just wrappin' it up
Life is a drug, so I trip like a Klutz
To the point where I'm really not giving a fuck
I think that I'm crazy
Fuck it, I know that I lost it
Ain't using my brain, so I might as well toss it
If you don't like me, then jump in a coffin, I bet you're exhausted
Poke out your eyes, so you can't see me flossin'
And cut off your tongue, so I can't hear you talkin'
Cut off your ears, so you can't hear me yappin'
I ain't mean to wake yo ass up with my rappin'
You still at the bottom
I'm still at the bottom, I'm not goin' anywhere
I'm chasin' the stardom, might happen tomorrow
Just hold on, I know we gon' make it there
We could look in the past and just drop it
But if you gon' keep it, I guess we could take it there
They say life is a game, well if that is the case
Then I guess I'm just not gone' be playing fair

But if you gon' keep it, I guess we could take it there
They say life is a game, well if that is the case
Then I guess I'm just not gone' be playing fair
I'm up with the rockets
I'm so outta pocket
I take off, I'm out of this atmosphere
I'm so out of this world
I'm so out of my mind
I'm so out of my place
I'm so out of here
Please get out of my way before I go insane
And then put yo ass out of your misery
All these niggas say that I'm so out of it
Well, I guess I don't know what's gotten into me
I'm just cruisin' and coolin', I vibe to survive and I hope you pick up on my energy
Catch his ass while he snoozin', that's straight homicide if you ever try takin' some shit to me
Swear the girl is the love of my life, is it cheating if I say that life is a bitch to me?
Am I mean if I tell you to go straight to hell, and that you niggas do not mean shit to me?
You still at the bottom
I'm still at the bottom, I'm not goin' anywhere

Not gon' be playing fair
Not gon' be playing fair
Yeah
I'm just not gon' be playing fair
They say life is a game
Well, if that is the case, then I guess I'm just not gone be playing fairYou gotta admit yourself
You need some help
I gotta admit myself
I'm on these drugs
Feel like I can't save myself
Sometimes I wanna take myself
And break myself
So I could reshape myself 
Nobody ever felt the pain I felt
So I share it
Put it out to the whole world, I ain't embarrassedShe's in my head like a melody, melody
I fell in love, it was heavenly, heavenly
We're in the groove, like the '70s, '70s
Love conversations, irrelevant, irrelevant
I don't wanna waste your time
Baby don't waste mine
Heard you were single for the night
Heard it through the grapevine
I was hoping I can stop time
And make things alright
Makin' out at the stop sign
Tonight's gon' be a long night
Why you lookin' at me like that, yeah?
Do you wanna go back to the crib?
'member we was up in L.A., yeah
I was tryna show you how I live
Hopefully, we don't get in this predicament
A-a-a-again
Hopefully, we don't get in any arguments
A-a-a-again
She's in my head like a melody, melody
I fell in love, it was heavenly, heavenly
We're in the groove, like the '70s, '70s
Love conversations, irrelevant, irrelevant
Where the hell is my promethazine?
What does my sorrow bring?
What will tomorrow bring, 'morrow bring?
Where in the fuck is my baby, she's missing
She's driving me crazy, she's driving me crazy, she's
Why you lookin' at me like that, yeah?
Do you wanna go back to the crib?
'member we was up in L.A., yeah
I was tryna show you how I live
Hopefully, we don't get in this predicament
A-a-a-again
Hopefully, we don't get in any arguments

Machete, mm
Comin' with pistols, I'm pissed

You think you're a bitch, uh huh

God damn, I love my straps
But, no, I don't fuck with these people
Bitch, I'ma  off the lean, yeah
Got your ho gassed up, still fucked her on E 
New Bentley truck, red seats 
Ain't even keep the receipt 
 
All this  clean 
Walk in the room, look like a hundred G's, uh
Fuck nigga sayin'? He ain't takin' my watch, nigga, please, uh
Folks on the Internet show his Glock, uh, nigga, please, uh
All my guns got a cold, I'm gon' make 'em sneeze
I say my wrist is enchantin'
...Float over my demons
I stay scheming
Tryna find a meaning
I've been dreaming
Purple got me leanin'
Woah, woah
Okay, huh
Float over my demons 
I've been scheming 
Tryna find a meaning, the purple got me leanin' 
The devil's tryna take my peace, I ain't going 
Say you tryna baptise me and I know it 
Still I gotta remain focused 
Life is a ocean, yeah, that's why I'm floating 
Sometimes, sometimes we can't help but sink in 
I've been tryna live my life, everyday's the weekend
Diving in the deep end, prescriptions my best friend
And this girl named Lotti is my girlfriend
Getting fucked up, drugs got me in a whirlwind
They say life is a bitch, mine just started twerking
Yeah, go through hell, I'm gon' buy new Chanel
Just to numb all the pain, get designer on my face
Okay yeah, go through hell
Throwin' quarters in wishing wells
Wish me well, I've been frank for about a day
I can't help but go astray
They say life is a maze
Mine is a death race
But I ain't dyin' today
Float over my demons
I've been scheming
Tryna find a meaning, the purple got me leanin'
The devil's tryna take my peace, I ain't going
Say you tryna baptise me and I know it
Still I gotta remain focused
Life is a ocean, yeah, that's why I'm floating
Sometimes, sometimes we can't help but sink in
I've been tryna live my life, everyday's the weekend, through your hood
Wish you would
Who do you think you are, Young Suge
Eating good
These niggas on the front porch like  
Roll up woods, pour up mud, let's get stuck 
Where my real ones go, we the only real ones
We don't play, get in our way, we gon' kill som' 
I miss my dog, in the slums, make him feel us
Won't stop 'till we see blood, make him feel the real us 
Pain in their veins, bullets tear leave a stain
From the pain in our brains when they took when I gained
Nowadays ain't the same
They wanna scream out they name 
No reply, so we gettin' high
Fire from the other side
Fuck your Glock, I need a gun with bigger tits 
Pop that thirty, not that ten, I need a bigger itch 
I got a job for you hoes, finding a bigger bitch 
Tryna move that cocaine by the zip, hide it by your tits 
Young rich niggas, we rare
All the hoes stop and stare 
Louis V underwear 
VVS solar flare 
Eskimo polar bear

Sorry mama I ain't mean to do it, accidental

Pull shit like Rodman I'm ballin' like Dennis
Feel like Serena Williams, I serve shit like tennis
She call me a menace, hold on let me finish
I'm a no good money maker, yeah with it
I told her that I don't care, ooh
I know you standing over there
With that other guy
But I don't care, huh

Back of the car with the blunts in our lyft
Never ever thought that I’d be getting high off a kiss
Grown man, heartbroke I thought Trix were for kids
Now I’m really thinking I won’t find a lover again
You lied when you told me that you want it forever
I Ball no matter the weather it’s forever
Another toxic love like, not again
Wash it down with klonopin
Give me one chance let me h-Time is going by slow and
Yeah
Time is going by slow and
I'm caught up in the moment
She knows me 
It ain't nothing for her to leave
It ain't nothing for her to leave
A wise man told me
Mhm
You better leave her while you got the chance
Don't even stay for another dance
She got a couple other mans
It was all part of her plan
I won't leave
It ain't up to me
This can't be happening to me
This can't be
This can't be

Raf Simons got me feelin' my soul
Percocet, it got me killin' my soul
But I still feel like the man
Yeah, I still feel like the man with the bands
Yeah, I still feel like the man with the plan
She knows I'll leave her someday
She knows that it's not Sunday

My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck, uh

When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh

Take my heart, I'll hand it over
Six months in, it gets colder
I don't want us to be over
Let's make love 'til we die
And let's fuck until we slump over
Be my first aid, I know you hate to see me bleed
I don't deserve your love, I tend to fuck up everything
It feels like I'm not enough, no, no, no
This a conversation, not a love song
Whoa, we met in a Twilight Zone
I fall apart but she keep me whole
We met on the West Coast
But I still see Miami in your soul
Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck, uh
You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?

Had a show up in Alaska, it was super cold
Bought a Moncler for it, I ain't even put it on
Had a show up in Chicago, I'm back home
Got the same old thots tryna blow up my phone
Like, "Can I get some tickets?" Bitch, no
"Come and get your dick licked," bitch, no
"Juice WRLD, you trippin'," I know
Where was y'all when I had my back to the wall?
I done glowed up, pourin' fours up
In the 'Rari doin' doughnuts, yeah
80K a show, 100K, I'll put a verse on there
Got my polе tucked, niggas slow up
Keep playin', you gon' die in herе
Amiri low-cut, cost four bucks
Young, rich nigga, I'm fly in here
Cookin' with the pots all on the stove
Wockhardt in my soda, take me home
Twelve be tryna tap in on my phone
That's why me and my niggas speak in codes
Had a show up in Alaska, it was super cold
Bought a Moncler for it, I ain't even put it on 
Had a show up in Chicago, I'm back home
Got the same old thots tryna blow up my phone
Them the same old thots from my old block
Choppa get to singing, shit like O' Block
Three hundred in that round, just like O' Block
But I be with No Limit, we got them poles tucked
Swervo in a Bentley truck, goin' brazy
Me, I'm in a Lamborghini on the daily
Hollywood with a bunch of savages from Chi-town
Livin' lavish, couldn't do this shit in my town
Had to take off, had to go with my heart, its a pray or pay off
40 take your face off, if you get in the way of the dreams I'm chasin'
Before I'm end this song, I'm sayin' RIP to my bro
Those who  had the AR, he used to let that bitch off
Cookin' with the pots all on the stove
Wockhardt in my soda, take me home
Twelve be tryna tap in on my phone 
That's why me and my niggas speak in codes
Had a show up in Alaska, it was super cold 
Bought a Moncler for it, I ain't even put it on 
Had a show up in Chicago, I'm back home 
Got the same old thots tryna blow up my phone Shit
Uh, it's been a long time comin'
But I'm still here
Everybody talking 'bout they numb or something 
Can you feel hell
All this fake shit around me is this some real hell?
All this sober shit around me is there some pills hell?
For real, I need to know
I need to know
My mama tell me that I need to let 'em go
She say the syrup in these pills finna kill me
But sometimes I think it brings out the real me
Sometimes I think it brings out the concealed me
Sometimes I think it exposes and reveals me
So what happens when the real meets the real
What happens when Juice meets the pills
Uh-uh-uh, yeah
Westwood shit
I'm up in London
Gettin' it bussin'
Ain't no disscusion, run up on me then I'm drummin'
My choppa sick or something
Like it was drunk I up it it'd start to vomit 
That's a bar
Lookin' at my watch like that's a star 
Lookin' at my spaceship like that's a car 
Lookin' at my pills, them Xanny bars, nah
In 2016 I was poppin' them Xannies
Now I'm in Percies
Lastin' forever in

Sit down muhfucker 'cause I know you can't stand it
Outlandish, I'm gorilla in the mesh
You just a Kung Fu Panda

Yeah, I did it
Mom, I made it
From goin' to physics class, to
Tourin' the world, shittin' on everybody, the world is my potty
I'm shitting on every possy
And I don't even got a team like that
I aim with my eye, I don't need a beam like that
Run up on me, choppa make you sing like that
Make you march like Martin Luther King, in fact
I'm blacked, and excellent
I'm shittin' on these niggas, this is a excrement
I rapped on another beat that's some extra shit
You niggas gon' have to deal with the mess of it
I thought I told yo' ass not to mess wit' it
I see this shit before I say it, telepathy
It's like I talk to my conscious, I say what it's tellin' me
Anything besides money, eh, it's kinda irrelevant
I can't focus without codeine, my medicine
I sip it until I'm slurrin' and spittin' impediments
I'm ballin' to the point where I think I need a Letterman
Westwood at the gates of London, he just had to let 'em in
I'm here, spazzin' on every single track he pass
You run up, I leave you leakin' on a maxipad
I'm ballin', hard, these other niggas on the bench
I swear, they need to stay where they at
Nigga, I'm takin' over the world, a map for a map
I'm off of a ecstasy pill, that's a flat for a flat
I'm up to bat, throw a fastball, it's a hit
I hit a lick, then I hit a hit on yo' bitch I don't miss
Listen, I heard yo' bitch on my hitlist
I hit that bitch, then I'm dippin'
You run up on me, I'm shootin'
That choppa on me is spittin'
My wordplay is amazing
My flow is so brazy 
I'm shakin' shit up like I said, no Haiti
This is freestyle shit, it's authentic
My flow, it burns niggas
Careers is arsenic 
My flow badder than bad women
I rock shows like Kravitz and John Lennon
Yo' sins ain't forgivin'
I'm the rap god, call me Juice Allah
Did I take it too far?
Did I take two bars, to get on Mars?
To more like  
I got a little tongue twisted, but I'm still gifted
Still spittin', still rippin' writtens
This premonition is really killin' it
And these niggas ain't shit
But Civics, me I'm Bentley
Get it, bitch
Don't you forget it
The shit that you talking, I really lived it 
I sold my soul then bought it back, I finessed 'em 
You run up on me, choppa holy it'll bless 'em 
He talking stupid 'till they shoot him, that's my weapon 
I got a couple of bars I could spit
Maybe I'll just use 'em in this shit
Or maybe I'll just use 'em in a skit
My first guess, they wanted shit
My next project, it's gon' be harder
My arm in the rim, really, I feel like Vince Carter
I'm at yo' head nigga, I feel like a barber
You on the bench nigga, and I am a starter
I die for my shit nigga, feel like I'm a martyr
My shit's off the charts
You run up, that's okay you catch a hole to your heart
I put that on my life, and that shit come from the heart
I'm freestyling on live, that's how it is
Yo' bitch swallow the kids
She up in my crib, I'm tellin' you how it is
Man, this rap shit serious like XM 
I ex them 
I fuck the bitch that he's next to 
She hangin' out, fuck her curfew 
You my son, lil' nigga I birthed you
But I shine, like the pair of them church shoes
I ain't been to church in a long time, 'cause they all lies
All the legends, where they at? They all die
Well, I don't wanna be a legend up in my prime
But, I know it's still prime time
Stars, how I shine
When they align with the planet, you know some shit is goin' on
I transform like Omegatron, when my favourite song is on
Fuckin' that bitch like the Ramadan
Man, I spit shit
So cool
I breakdance shit like the old school
I'm never runnin' out of energy, I'm a suspect grippin' this  vicinity
Try me if you want, 'cause I swear it's not gon' end cool
I'ma prolly pull up to your cruel like, "Where the fuck is you"
Cock it back and then I shoot
W-W-W, I can't lose
Ayy, I flew from London to Chicago
Money in my pockets, I may get a Murciélago
That's all that I know
Shout out to my kinfolk, they know I'm totin' ammo
In the streets they call me Rambo, ain't no peace where I'm from
But these pieces, we tote 'em, you run up on me it's over
Like a cig, we gon' smoke 'em
I put yo' ass in a coma
Smokin' kush, this aroma, leave yo' ass in a coma
Ballin' out like I'm Odom before the crack, don't you get it?
Spittin' crack on these niggas, define niggas like physics
Shut the fuck up and listen, I'm ballin' hard like a Piston
Nigga this shit's enlisted just like a army lil' nigga
I swear to god I'm invincible you can't harm me lil' nigga, yeah

        Lyrics from Snippets
Girl, I know you can't do it with no hands
Travel through my mind, and we can spend these bands
We can spend some time, London and France
And maybe Japan, I'm the Karate Kid
That mean I been gettin' money like I'm Jaden Smith
I'm a real one, all these other niggas counterfeit
I'ma pop some, I'm gettin' too old to throw a fist 
Brodie unloadin' the clip , took all my enemies away
Knock-knock, let me in, perc, no Klonopin
I'm ballin' super hard like James Harden
In the fourth quarter, that's me, catch him like a taxi
Runnin' like I'm Usain, bullet better track meet
Bape on my cape, I'm an animal, a monkey
Life is such a jungle so I come through like Jumanji
Hadouken, I'm Ryu with the combo
Runnin' through this shit the six with Drake in TorontoIt's been a long time comin'
I been road runnin', rockin' shows stuntin'
Smokin' on Runtz'n, codeine for lunch'n
Yeah, poured a 4 and a red in my lunch'n
I got bored, let the dragons out my dungeon, yeah
Mixin' pills watch 'em stir up in my stomach, yeah
Give her pipe, pipe, pipe I'm a plumber, yeah
Pockets Jim Carrey going dumber and dumber in here
I'm goin' crazy for your love
I ain't talkin' bout a girl, no I'm talkin' bout the drugs
I'm goin' crazy for your love
Not about a girl, it's about the drugs
Uh, plug on my phone I love to pick up
I nicknamed my plug day makeup
I nicknamed these drugs like take us
A dream take us, I'm a dream chaser
Wake up, grippin styrofoam
Lost inside my mind, I'm looking for a home
Off these Percocets, in the underworld I roam
I don't know where to go, I must get high that's fasho
It's been a long time comin'
I been road runnin', rockin' shows stuntin'
Smokin' on Runtz'n, codeine for lunch'n
Yeah, poured a 4 and a red in my lunch'n
I got bored, let the dragons out my dungeon, yeah
Mixin' pills watch 'em stir up in my stomach, yeah
Give her pipe, pipe, pipe I'm a plumber, yeah
Pockets Jim Carrey going dumber and dumber in here
Pockets on Jim Carrey goin dumber and dumber 
I feel like I'm Nick Cannon the way that I'm drummin' 
I feel like I got an extra finger or somethin' 
All these hunneds I'm thumbin', all these hunneds I'm thumbin' through
Hit her from the back till she scream, ooh-woah
RIP to Nipsey, he was leavin' blue clues
Red bottoms, super bloody, Piro shoes
Step on his head in the night, yeah
Got the metal like a knight, yeah
Left right, we could fight
Codeine, with the Sprite, yeah
Boldin' with the spray, yeah
I pull up to yo block but you would never realize
No LeBron in the fuckin ballin' Cavaliers
I'm a vampire, Buffy isn't welcome here
The end is near, ayy
I'm buried alive, my right is left, my left is right
I fucked yo bitch and left her right
Back at the motel had a hell of a night
I'm in the sky like an eagle, eagle
Even though a nigga pelican fly
I remember they was doubtin'
They ain't know I had my eyes on the prize
In the studio sippin' codeine all night
How a fuck nigga slippin' on put 'em on ice
Shoot the brain out his head then I leave him to die
I just gave his mama a reason to cry
I'm a real ass nigga don't believe in the lies
Please don't look me in my eyes
'Cause you could see the pain inside
Leave a nigga terrified
It's been a long time comin'
I been road runnin', rockin' shows stuntin'
Smokin' on Runtz'n, codeine for lunch'n
Yeah, poured a 4 wit a red in my lunch'n, yeah

This shit could kill, like sick as hell 
Go to sleep, wake up, bricks sell

Park that bitch up in a garage 
Park that bitch up in a garage My life is unreal and I just go ghost
They say my life deserve a camera, I'm a GoPro
I grew up west of Indiana where it's cold cold, yeah baby, too cold
I'm jumping like Jordan with my money 
Niggas helped me find the wave just so I could buy a new boat
Nigga use that wave, I'ma surf we don't do boats
Still in Dior clothes, I'm on the block, ho
Shots hit your spine, leave you lying in your chanclas
Let's take it to the basics 
Five gram wood, roll it up, face it 
Feeling damn good, legend in the making
Percocet chasing
Feeling wasted, wastеd, on daily basis
999, different world we facing
Shoutout to that boy, Kid LAROI
Killеr in the making
 Illinois, noise we'll be making
Young nigga's up and got the old niggas hating
Peek-a-boo from my label
Old Niggas picking raising
I'll get back to them later, I'm busy achieving greatness
Rich boy, with my laser for Glizzy is aim amazing
Hope you don't get in the way, we get busy, leave you on the pavement
Soon we gonna get over it, ay
My mind full of torment, ay
Demons run dormant, ay
I want peace, no peace
My life is unreal and I just go ghost
They say my life deserve a camera, I'm a GoPro
I grew up west of Indiana where it's cold cold, yeah baby, too cold
I'm jumping like Jordan with my money 
Niggas helped me find the wave just so I could buy a new boat
Nigga use that wave, I'ma surf we don't do boats
Still in Dior clothes, I'm on the block, ho
Shots hit your spine, leave you lying in your chanclas
Pills all the time got me down, cutthroat
Pain in my mind and my heart, mental
Saying by the time, from the start, should be harder
Everything is going all fine, couldn't be finer
Substance abuse, could've help me harder
Popping out with my tool  harder
I've been played as a fool, then I got smarter
Finally met my boo, she stitch my heart up
Living in the groove
So why we on the moon?
Yeah, we fuck on the moon
We'll be playing me and you
You ignite my light, set off my fuse
Got a fight with the devil, you won't let me lose 
My life is unreal and I just go ghost
They say my life deserve a camera, I'm a GoPro
I grew up west of Indiana where it's cold cold, yeah baby, too cold
I'm jumping like Jordan with my money 
Niggas helped me find the wave just so I could buy a new boat
Nigga use that wave, I'ma surf we don't do boats
Still in Dior clothes, I'm on the block, ho
Shots hit your spine, leave you lying in your chanclasOh, oh, mmm

Daytrip took it to 10
Fly in a plane
And me and you can go to mars on the weekend
You got a rockstar boy as a boyfriend
Livin' in the moment
He faking, he phony
The hell make no sense, Uh
Uh, number one, first place
Bound to make the beat shake, earthquake
Pull up on 'em semi-auto, let it spray
Hit his face, he won't see tomorrow, okay
Man down, man down, mayday
That’s what you get for tryna holla at my lay day
Niggas think it's sweet, boy it look like a play day
Mask on me trick-or-treat, happy a belated Halloween
Working round' my side of town, in the back of the Bentley busy
You know I was , my head tryna get dizzy
I don't walk too much, but I gotta sеnse he didn’t wanna see me
Lil fuck nigga talk too tough, I'll bouta' fuck nigga with a sеmi
She gave me her all her love, good body 
Addicted to all these drugs
Roll it up, pull it up, pop it up, face it
Unreleased songs about her on her playlist
If you try to take her from me, grrr I'ma spray itOoh
It woulda been a right and not another wrong, hey
She told me that it's all my fault
It woulda have been perfect all along
It woulda been a right and not another wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song, oh
'Cause it's all my fault, she would've been perfect alone
I would have been a right not another wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song
She like a mouse in a mouse trap, stuck up
She got me rolling weed now, I'm fucked up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You heated too much and I’m the summer
I'll let you cool down
And I brought you 'round momma
But you let me down, yeah, you let me drown in drama
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
You talking too much, so shut the fuck up
I'll let you cool down
And I brought you 'round momma
But you let me down, yeah, you let me drown in drama
It woulda have been perfect along
It woulda been a right and not another wrong
And it would be a happy not a sad song, oh
'Cause it's all my fault, she would've been perfect all along
I should have took a right but I took a wrong
Happy not a sad song
It’s a happy not a sad song, happy not a sad song
I should have took a right but I took a wrong
Happy not a sad song
All my fault
I swear it’s all my fault
I was takin' Xanax, fucked up
I almost had a OD, lucked up
I'm rappin' too much, 'cause I'm a singer
I'm married to money, that’s my ringer
And I can't cool down
I need percs now, I need percs now
To put me out my drama
It was all my fault
It woulda been perfect all along
All my fault, it was all my fault
Took a right shoulda took a wrong
Everything is goin' wrongHave you ever fallen head over heels for somebody?
Not just somebody
No, no
Have you fallen head over heels for somebody
That made promises to give you the world? 
I really hope they held you down
I really hope it was no lying 'cause my heart breaks
It feels like the world's gone
But if the love's real, you'd feel your soul roar like a lion
And you'd finally let bygones be bygones
Don't throw in the towel, I know it feels like you're the only one trying
You just gotta learn to live and love on
Uh, sometimes life's a mess 
I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love didn't click
Searching for somethin' real, then I found it
Uh-uh, sometimes life's a mess
Yeah, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love ain't click
Looking for somethin' real, then I found it
Got pretty fucking bad, well it's better now
Through the trials and tribulations, I found my way out
Feel all of the good and bad vibrations all around
All around us, they surround us
Was a lost cause, with some lost love
It ain't my fault, pain chose us, then I found her
My whole world turned upside down, uh
But for the better
I belong with the one put on this earth for me
Everybody has their someone, just gotta look and see
I'm screaming out, "Lord, help me, I've been lonely"
That's when you accept me
Then you set me free
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love didn't click
Searching for somethin' real, then I found it
Uh-uh, sometimes life's a mess
Yeah, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love ain't click
Looking for somethin' real, then I found itLyrics from Snippet
...When I hold your hand it feels like I'm in Bel-Air
Does it hurt to say I actually live in Bel-Air?
But it don't feel like Bel-Air when you're not there
Guess I'm going back to the slums, gunshots in the air
Grrah, grrah, grrah
This year, this year
Who would've thought I found my true ride-or-die this year?
Who would've thought I'd fall in love and catch a vibe this year?
I remember when I thought I was gon' die this year, yeah
All my pain on my face, all my hate, all my tears
Every time you come here, you just make 'em go away
On my knees, shedding tears, pray to God, hope he hears
Every time you come here, you make it all go away
Oh, boy I'm blessin', you teachin' me lessons
Me, you, let 'em view, we be flexin'
You beautiful, you be leaving me breathless
I can't breathe, ayy
Same time, girl, you're like a breath of fresh air
Fresh air, I can breathe, but baby when you're not here
Bank is-

Yeah, I'm fighting insanity
I don't have no vanity
The shadows my family
The demons they dance with me
I've been fighting insanity
I don't have no vanity
These shadows my family
Demons they dance with me
These niggas make belief but me I'm high as can be
Yeah, me I am fly as can be
Still fighting insanity
I know my wrongs are right
I know my rights are wrong
I know I had it all along till I made this song
I'm going insaneUh, uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh, uh
Swallow all these pills with my pride 
Married to my highs, you may kiss the bride
Trouble in my brain, see it in my eyes
I got voices in my head, they keep me up at night
Said I was okay, but I'm lying, feel like that I'm dying
Soul screaming and crying, feel my brain frying
Try to numb the pain, all the drugs I've been buying
This oxy gettin' pricey, pour the codeine in the Hi-C
Blood red blend in the Hi-C
I've been doing so much wrong, even though ma told me to do the right thing
Poppin' pills all night long, in the studio pourin' out my feelings
Can't explain this feeling
Kinda feels like I'm losing even though I'm winning
Drain out bad energy 
Forget the bad memories 
Multi-million dollars
All mine from the start
Codeine kills the drama
And the trauma in my heart
Just got a call from the dark side
Stab wounds in my chest, but I'm alright
I miss my friends, I hate this spotlight
I love my girl, I hate the thot life
Yellow diamonds, shiny pearls
I'm tryna give her the world
I'm tryna show her the world
She ain't no ordinary girl
I know she know, I know she know I'm down and out
Life is a ocean, demons I've been drownin' out
I watch the crowd and crack a smile
I have a job to lead them out
Drain out bad energy 
Forget the bad memories 
Drain out bad energy 
Forget the bad memories Lyrics from Snippets

I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song 
Ain't no tellin' where we'll end up
Daytrip took it to 10 
Last night was a blur
So good I wasn't sure if we made love, or if we made something more
Last thing I remember is me walking out the door
Next thing you know, woke up on the floor
I don't know whose house this is, but I know I'm in Hollywood
Scramble for my keys then I stumble to the car
I look in the back seat, what do I see?
Bro passed out, laying next to a bad bra
Looks like they had a good time
I must have took us for some reason, I can't remember my night
Reach in my pockets, what do I find?
Half a percocet, two hundred dollars, and a weed pipe
That's when somebody hit my phone line
Saying, "Yesterday was wild,“ askin' if I'm alright
I don't know what happened, but I wanna know
I guess we gotta do it all over again tonight
I'll hop in my car with my friends and play my song
I hope the memories we make last all life long
I'll hop in the car with my friends and play my song, song
Ain't no telling where we'll end up
Here we go again, woke up in a bed
But it wasn't my bed, whose is this?
Vision kinda blurry, I can't see shit
Wrapped around my body, I see two tattooed hands
Last night more blank than the night before
At least I made it to a bed, last time I woke up on the floor
All I could remember is a bitch screaming, "More! More! More! More!"
Videos in my phone, we were in a high speed chase in a white Rolls
Looks like we threw them hands too
Here's a clue, knuckles bruised, and somebody else's blood on my elbows
Lately I've been buggin' out, drugs gettin' too strong
Buying all the pills from the plug, money too long
I get high to let go and find out where I belong
Probably by my V-lone, party with my demonsUh
Yeah, I bet that
Uh, he'll die
Get chopped up, big Glocks tucked
Send shit up, give no fucks

Won't let you suck my cock if you just run
She going in that porsche

Got so many questions
Spend more money when I'm off the percocets
I hit that bitch with the Juice Wrld swerve
But I ain't like fucking bitches crazy
Party last night was a blacked out blur, 
Gettin' the pussy, gettin' the kidney
Hit it too good that lil bitch purr
I told that man I fucked his bitch
He looked at her and she concurred
Why'd you do that? Are you sure?
She was sober when she did it
I ain't even let her drink no beer
'Cause I wanted her to remember that she fucked on juicethekidd
That's that juicethekidd
That was way before all the riddance

Love don't grow on trees
Ain't nothing but much as vacancy
You won't make love, you just make believe
Babygirl love don't grow on trees
So keep that love shit away from me
Love don't grow on trees
I don't got no heart its a vacancy, ayy
You could die in the flames of ur heart that you buried
I do drugs everyday but the shit doesn't carry me
Swallow them in the face, he's scared of me, cupid in the face
He scared of me, drugs to the face, brain erase
I'm in the cut, razorblade
I'm throwing shade never shave
But sometimes I need to shave for a rainy day
Slow down, down
We don't gotta rush things
It wouldn't be the first time
Slow her down
We don't gotta rush things no more
Prowl my heart
Take my heart I don't need it anymore
You can keep the change
Cupid had an AK-47 my heart is a gun range
I feel like a rap goat  'cause I run this shit like Usain
Love don't grow on trees
Keep that love shit away from me
Ain't nothing but much as vacancy
You won't make love, you just make believe
Babygirl love don't grow on trees
So keep that love shit away from me
Love don't grow on trees
I don't got no heart it's a vacancy, ayyOh, oh
I was off the drugs, I know
Time, oh
You know it's Mitch Mula, drop that bumboclaat
Time after time
You been on mind, I been feelin’ blind
Feel like a hell of a guy
Xanax and Percocets, hell of a high
I'm in a coffin, I'm buried alive
She told me that she was ready to die
I go to sleep ’til the funeral cries
They say they see all the drugs in my eyes
Right or wrong 
Another one that told you I'ma love you forever
Right or wrong 
I don't think no other nigga is treating you better, yeah
Right or wrong 
I understand that we don't have an understanding
Right or wrong 
Do you understand that I don't really like attachmеnts?
But you do what you do, I do what I do
Love is suicide, call me suicidal
Xanax and Pеrcocets and alcohol in my vitals
I feel like I'm goin' to hell, Satan disciple, no
I'm too positive check, my prerogative high
Man, prerogative Xanax, words stumbling guy
My momma told me that it wouldn’t hurt to try
I told her, "Yeah, but it would hurt to die"
So I’m not gonna try

They say they see all the drugs in my eyesOh, oh, oh

Brodie unloadin' the clip , took all my enemies away

Buy me a whip, take out the brain
Money a crip, Blueface
Send me a pic and I'ma do the rest, like LeBron James
Rockin' Ricks with a Kel-Tec and I got good aim
I can't die today, tomorrow I promised my girl we'd go on a date
Girl, I know you can't do it with no hands

They don't want no smoke
Nah, they don't want no cancer
Praying that they find the cure to cancer we need answers
Shittin' on my ex so much that I don't got no manners
Up in school I used to skip
And roll that doja in my planner, uh

Go insane boy, this is off the brain boy
But not PS not no Xbox
Not no BS nigga I won't stopI got God on my side
Remember when He sent you to me that night
Had to cuff you up, like a cop on a heist
Cupid is the judge, so I must testify
I won't move or budge, I'll stand by you for life
All my life, when you die is when I die
I sometimes wonder why
We argue and fight
And quickly make things right
It's probably 'cause we gotta grow more over time Wouldn't be real love without rough nights Can't feel these drugs, but I feel your eyes When you look at mine, things feel alright
When it's dark outsidе, you're always the light 
This heart of minе was once cold as the ice 
The more I try, the more I open my mind, for you
To find, the demons hidin' deep inside
Been through it, I don't really wanna get into it
Throwin' out your heart to break mine, so I won't do it
Also baby, you're my lifeline, you're an influence
All the times you was mad, I was over under the influence
I feel sorry for the people that don't get it
It's really rare that you feel the real love feelin'
Some people get hurt and never love again
Some people get hurt and give the drugs a binge
Some people get dressed and go and hit the club to mend
There's no love in one-night stands, but you can play pretend
And me, I'ma admit it
All of these hoes one thing, that's pretentious
And if I know one thing, then I know this
It's us forever, worse or better, no discussion
That's how I'm comin'
When it's dark outside, you're always the light 
This heart of mine was once cold as the ice 
The more I try, the more I open my mind, for you
To find, the demons hidin' deep insideLyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been releasedI got just an idea

Pull up in a drop-top and she top me off
I may pick her up but I won't drop her off
I sip Codeine whenever I get a cough
Rock designer while standin' over a loft
It costs to be the boss, when they die, I pay the costs

You told me you were finna go and recruit more
Maybe that means he'll drop the price on you

Two of you just need too much
Not two of you is not enough

We're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it
There's love at my front door, short notice
She not like the sane girls, I noticed
Think I met my soulmate, yeah, I know it
When it gets dark outside, in you I confide
You help me face my demons, I won't hide, hide
Girls like you are hard to find
I hope you don't mind, if I give you the time of your life, life, life
Really think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home

She really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold
We're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it
I love the streets too much and I be slingin' and bangin'
She heard all about me she know 'bout my reputation
Scared to love me back, she know I'm dangerous and crazy
I just want your heart so I can take it and break it
I just want for you to hold it down for me, baby
I just want for you to stay around when I'm faded
You don't hold me down, who gon' be down?

Stay strapped up like I'm finna join ISIS
All that talking, just do it like Nike

Up that choppa if he talkin', bet it's gettin' him gone
And these niggas gon' be mad, this is off of the dome
I ain't even take time to write this down, 'cause this shit easy

Illusions be optical
Recently had a relationship I think her love was optional
Ain't no way to fix the shit she did, suffer the damage ho
We used to go by Lake Michigan to go shopping, oh

And I could easily replace you
When you should be thankful
This is real love, I am not a prankster
My fault, it was real love, that's in the past tense
That's where I'ma leave it
That's when I'ma leave-I'm a percaholic

With the pills up in that bottle
I’m in love with a Hellgirl
Red hair, goddess
Athena is her mom
But Hades is her father
She has control over my brain

Hiding it is probably the best thing

Common sense
Drugging me is what you did it
You didn't even know you did it
That type of love is the realest
Walk through the night we can look at the stars
I saw the same constellations in your eyes
You don't need a flashlight trying walking through my heart
You'll need a bigger flashlight for my mind
Pray to God everyday that we don't fall apart
That's my biggest fear I can't deny
I love you, I love you, I love you
I can't stand you

Ups and downs off the percs, that's a seesaw
I told her howdy come around and she said yee-haw
Benjamin Franklin go 
When I throw money on the ho 
Everyday I give to the dough 
What makes the world go around?

Devil in my cribLyrics from Snippet
I just left a bad bitch for another one
Off a perky, but I think I need another one

Oh well, I got another oneLyrics From Snippet

She so mean
She don't love me, no
She'd still fuck me
That time I was 
I got money so-
I love love and love don't love me
She don't love me, she'd still fuck meI'ma spaz, breathing fire like a dragon
Nigga off a Xan, on the track I'm probably draggin'
I don't get time for these ticks and these maggots
Automatic flows, load my verbs up, let 'em have it
Ballin' like a Maverick
Make 'em disappear, magic
Niggas get in a accident, fuck with me, it's tragic
They don't want no smoke, nah, they don't want no cancer
Prayin' that they find a cure to cancer, we need answers
Shitting on my ex so much that I don't got no manners
Up in school, I used to skip, and wrote that dogie in my planner, uh
I go nuts like Planters, uh, all of this God's plan, uh, man
Hope you understand I shoot like a child from Afghanistan, uh, yеah
Look, switch my flow up, mix the liquor with the percs
Hopе I don't throw up, lean I pour up
Need some mo' until I got red guts, 'til I got purp' guts
Niggas can't fuck with us, huh
Mayweather with the uppercut, uh
Hit him in the stomach like five or six times 'til he had enough, uh
Freestyle I kick it, off of the dome like a frog, I ribbit
Hop on the beat, you know I rip it
Rip it to riddance, rip it to smithereens
They don't wanna fuck with me, I'm with the fuckery
Rushin' hours, I would kick high like Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker be, damn 
Bitch I'm confident, this flow to me it's common sense
Uh huh, I'm gonna bomb, no offense on that Osama shit, uh huh
That's your mama shit, put my dick up in your mama shit, uh huh
WWW, ain't on shit dot com and shit, uh huh
Look at my flow though, I'm outta space, bitch, I'm on Pluto
Like the Oz, I'm a wizard but I'm a dog, call me Toto
Pose for the photo, that lil' bitch dance like Gogo, oh
No-no, she get low-low like a limbo
Fuck her then I pass her to my kinfolk, ugh
007 with the ammo, uh
Pull up on the scene like Rambo, uh
Money older than your grandfolks' grandfolks
Nigga you cannot handle, oh, huh
Yo bitch up in my hand like a Game Boy
Then again I turn that power off, this not no game, boy
Huh, Barack Obama always wanted to change, boy
Pennies, dimes, quarters, all tonight, I want the change, boy
My niggas from over East, you know they got that range, boy
I'm sad to say this not no XBOX, not no game, boy
Huh, not no game, boy, this not no game, boy
Ain't no PS, ain't no XBOX, not no game, boy
Go insane boy, this is off the brain, boy
But not no PS, not no XBOX, not no BS
Nigga, I won't stopI can't tell, if this is a dream
Am I awake or am I asleep
I don't have answers, philosophies
Mean nothing to me right now
And I can't tell, if you were with me or against me
All my friends say you're icky vicky
I feel like Timmy, I keep on wishing
For better days, better days
Need some stronger pills for better days
I been risking my life since you been away
Tryna' get your attention from far away
I've been having lucid dreams, stupid dreams
Thinkin' bout you and me, fluently
I've been experimenting to take the pain away
Wake up thinking I heard your name
I've been waiting, I'm contemplating
Say you love me girl you were playing
None of this don't matter when we die
I won't wipe your tears not when you cry
This ain't love girl, this more like hatred
I've been down this road too many times before
Hoes in my phone, they are replacements
But they feel nothing like you, you made me whole
This is the part where I confess that
Most of my relations were toxic
Happiness will come when its ready
Hold out your hands and embrace it with open arms
This is the part where I confess that
Toxic humans come off attractive
I made this song for anyone thats going through it
I’ll clean up the mess
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Na, nah, nahhhhh, na-na
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Na, nah, nahhhhh, na-na
What's the matter?
Questions are unanswered
If you need some help, Ima tweet away
Hit me today, heyyy
I’ve been waitin’, I'm contemplatin’
Say you love me, girl you were playin’
None of this gone matter when we die
I won’t wipe your tears, not when you cry
This ain't love girl, it's more like hatred
I’ve been down this road, too many times before
Hoes in my phone, they your replacement
But they feel nothing like you, you made me wholeLyrics From Snippet
Um
In my heart is your bed 
I'm getting lost in my head 
Me being high brings you dread 
I'ma break up with the drugs, then I'll be a lonely manUh, I lowkey should've wrote this when I first met you, but yeah
Hope you like it, listen, here you go, cheers
Uh, I'm in the studio early with it today man, It's worth it
Yeah, uh nuh nu nu, turn me up in my headphones
Look, listen listen
I wanna set aside time, but I can't describe the way that I feel
This ain't a love song but a  I wanna keep this shit real
Lowkey, these words are so overdue, and you, yeah you
You're so overcute, so beautiful to my cute beaucoup
When you around, this a marvelous view
Me, you, should just take a drive, uh-huh
See the fuck shit in the rear view, It appears that it's clear too
Just a  half way there, gotta' keep it real for you
Just hope that you listen 
Can't see much, but like Stevie I'm a wonder with the Vision
Looks like it's an interest, take a chance hell yeah we can risk It
Girl, we can risk it, damn
My thoughts are all over the place
And I see yo' blessing all over your face
You outta' this world, but I met you in space
I'm screaming out wait, before I continue
I just really wanna get one thing straight
You make the sun look like a freeze pop
Somebody pass me the goddamn sunscreen
And now it's just one, made it
Ayy bae can you hangout on the weekend?
Or a weekday, like a Monday or a Wednesday
Maybe we can Tee up on a Tuesday
Maybe one day, maybe two days, just a few days
Just a few more, I don't play games, but with this wordplay, shit ayy
Nigga still got the high school up, that's a lot more
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, uh, uh, ayy
This my favorite part right here 
It's some old school shit you feel me? Yeah
No need to run, I can't run
There ain't no hiding, I'm done
I'm gonna' say how I feel, then I may roll me a blunt
You tell me quit all the smoking, it's too much weed in my lungs
I say I quit, I don't need it, cause this the weed in my lungs
But I could promise you this, you get me higher than that
You see that airplane in the sky? Well girl you're flyer than that
And when I get this record deal, I may just buy you a jet
Cause I just think you the bet, person that I've ever met
Perfect but better than that, worth it, I think that's a fact
I hope you listen to this, think about it, give it a chance
I know I feelin' you lady, I hope you feeling again
But I'm not kidding with you no-no, this is what you are meant
I write this for you again, fuck it again and again
I do it over and over and over 'til you give in
I hope I cause a commotion emotion you to commit
I wanna tell you more about it, but this song finna end
Nah, nah, ayy, haha, I hope you like itMario!
Took the long way home
No shortcuts, short, take the long way home
No shortcuts, short, take the long

Shut the fuck up, please don't talk now
Presidential Rollie lookin' like the White House
She call me a dog, yeah, bitch, I bite down
You don't want it, dawg, got it on me right now
I'm too fucked up, took the long way home
Shoes cost 3K like it's Andre, oh

Think about me when I'm gone, Post Malone
I get too drunk, I'ma blackout
I took two pills, I'ma pass out
They tell me I should settle down
But I feel like a rebel now, now, now, now
I got too drunk, I'ma blackout

'Member when I had a one and only
Then she hurt me, talking to the Perkys
She could call my phone but it ain't workin'
I'm on top, I get top
In the drop, fuck that shit, I swerve a lot
Swerve a lot, on that bitch, I swerve a lot, yeah
I'ma talk the talk, it's the talk of a boss
I don't talk it, I walk it
Run up on me, I'm poppin'
Keep the gun in my pocket, yeah
Double G on me, that's when I'm shoppin', yeah
Run up a sack, don't run out of options
Smoke so much I think I need another lung
Ayy, fuck my liver up, I need another one
Fell in love with Perkys, yeah, I love the blues
Mix it with the Henny, ain't got shit to lose
Now I'm seein' double, seein' two, seein' two
I feel like a ghost when I look at you, peek-a-boo
I get so damn high, I don't know what to do, up to you
You could be my lover and my drug too
Mega, you played that boyMy bros catching body bags
Yeah, yeah, um, ah
Let's go, where the fuck the molly at?
Woah, time to catch a body bag
My bros down to catch a body bag
My bros down to catch a body bag
Woah, where the fuck the molly at?
Oh, time to catch a body bag
My bros down to catch a body bag
My bros down to catch a body bag
Uh, keep it in the stash box
My bros known to make them Glocks pop
My bros known to keep the blocks hot
My bros known to ring the gun shots, grrah
Man down, hospital bed, he done, ah
Repeat, did the same shit, huh, next week, huh
Turn the party to a track meet, yeah
Who the tough guy now? It's me
Who the tough guy now? It's me
You ain't know I had my thing with me
You ain't know I was known to let it bang on the scene
Now you bleed, bleed, bleed 
Now it's rest in peace, peace, peace

        PendingShe told me put my heart in the bag and I'll never get hurt
I'm not running from her love, I'm not fast, it's getting better, not worse
Now I'm covering the grave from my past, I'm a whole different person
You're a gift not a curse, oh my god, you are so worth itLyrics From Snippet
Yeah, huh
Yeah, what
Her nigga say I got a Gucci purse 
But what I got in here prolly get him merked 
Load it up, let it go, he in a hearse 
Ballin' out super hard, Kyrie Irv' 
And her nigga say I got the Louis...
... 
Off a perc, yeah, I'm a whole different person 
On my IG, shit, she be lurkin' 
On some high-key shit, my heart hurtin' 
I...Lyrics from Snippet
...
I give her all of my effort, she say it's whatever 
I should've put effort in finding somebody better 
Now I'm hung like a hook, sing this song forever 
No pun intended but these words are a little too clever 
I'm in the bushes while she walk home
I'm her secret admirer...Lyrics from Snippets
I want to own you, control you
Never seen a soul like yours before
Girl, I adore you, would die for you
Your ex won't though, with me, I'll show you
She my queen, instead have a dark king
Devil gets there first, waiting for me
Devil does his worst, he can't harm me
Sittin' there alone, I'm like, "You and what army?"
Baby, I can't help the way I feel
Got me havin' love dreams but this shit is real, real, real
Got me poppin' whole Percs, I don't know how to deal
Got me goin' on and on and I can't feel
Oh-oh, you belong, with me
Or no one at all
I want to own you, control you
Never seen a soul like yours before
Girl, I adore you, would die for you
Your ex won't though, with me, I'll show you
 sick, but I can never get sick of your love
 reachin' for...
...
...that you on
Oh-oh, you belong, with me
Or no one at all
I want to own you, control you
Never seen a soul like yours before
Girl, I adore you, would die for you
Your ex won't though, with me, I'll show you

I’m not in love but I love it 
I feel the rush and I love it 
Yeah, I could break your heart like it's nothing 
Yeah, 'cause I'm not in love and I love it 
I'm in that fast car swervin', yeah 
Bitch, the scenery is perfect, yeah 
Like, oh my God, I love it, yeah 
She know I'm fly and she loves it, yeah 
Your boy cool but he not me, ah 
All this ice feel like hockey, yeah 
I'm knockin’ ’em out like Rocky 
I get to that green, that broccoli 
I'm in that foreign, ain’t no pullin' over 
I broke your heart, no, we can't do it over 
You funny girl, you tried to screw me over 
You dummy girl, no, you can’t screw me over 
Tricks are for kids, not me

Yeah, 'cause I'm not in love and I love it 
I'ma put a Rollie on my left wrist 
I'ma put some diamonds on my necklace 
I'ma run through a check like a checklist 
We some young wild niggas, yeah, we reckless 
She keep calling me a rock-star 
'Cause I dance on top of cop cars 
And I'm causing all this heartbreak 
But baby tell me how that pain taste 
You won't live to tell the story later 
Two guns like I'm Tomb Raider 
Raf Simons be my new shoes, yeah 
Bitch, I'm still boolin' in my blue shoes 
Still boolin' in my ex crib
I be stuntin' on my ex bitch 
I be stuntin' 'til I can't stunt, yeah 
You know I'ma act like I don't know none

To uh, uh uh
See you smile
Do anything
In my power
To see)
I’d do anything, in my power
To see you just smile
I want you to prosper
And come proper
Even if that means I ain’t by your side
I’d do anything in my power
To see you just smile
I want you to prosper
And come proper
Even if that means I ain’t by your side
Devil on my shoulder tellin' me I'll die soon
I don't really want that to impact you
But I don't know, maybe I'm just paranoid
I just want the best for you, I just want what's left of you
Oh, you tell me that you're sad inside
I'm sad that I can't satisfy
Yeah, I pray that I get it right this time
Maybe we'll be alright
Oh, you tell me that you're sad inside
I'm sad that I can't satisfy
Yеah, I pray that I get it right this time
Maybe wе'll be alright
I’d do anything, in my power
To see you just smile
I want you to prosper
And come proper
Even if that means I ain’t by your side
I’d do anything in my power
To see you just smile
I want you to prosper
And come proper
Even if that means I ain’t by your side
Between you and me I think that I’m gon’ die
Soon, it’s cool
I got what’s coming to me it’s cool
Ain’t no point runnin’ from me, it’s cool
Ain’t no escaping, I tried to escape it
But I hate it
Am I complex, am I basic
Interviews with complex, very basic
Shit I hate it
The worst thing I ever did was become famous
The doctor told me I’d be dead by next June
Unless I stop all these pills I’m in to
I haven’t had enough
I want to die below
I’d do anything, in my power
To see you just smile
I want you to prosper
And come proper
Even if that means I ain’t by your side
I’d do anything in my power
To see you just smile
I want you to prosper
And come proper
Even if that means I ain’t by your side
