Back with the remix
These boys all my sons like Phoenix 
My city and state never ever seen this
Jimmy Neutron, I'm a young boy genius 
On the futon, I'ma give her that penis
When this shit's done, I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, like Gilbert Arenas
Shoot my shot, I'm still with the demons, ooh
I keep it thorough
I got five chicks in New York, that means one in each borough
I'm in the pocket like Burrow
When I'm back home, though, they treat me like Robert De Niro
Took her to Taco Bell, bought her a churro
Took her home, gave her a cinnamon swirl
I left it in, now I got a one-year-old
Zeros on zeros on zeros 
That's what my bank account balance say 
I got a check from the shoe company
Now I do anything that New Balance say
I bought her a plane ticket, out of state

Brain real good, she a scholar

I'm real creative and stylish, F&N in my denim

And I just flew back from L.A. on the jet yesterday 
I go back and forth like I play tennis

Whoop a nigga like I'm Batman, nigga 
I just pulled up in the Batmobile 
The reason I ain't fuckin' with these rap-ass niggas
'Cause they cap-ass niggas , and they raps ain't real 
Believe me, you wanna keep your life, then take it easy
I'm rockin' water diamonds, need a Squeegee
These niggas watered down, they drinkin' Fiji
My whip is orange and brown like I'm in Cleveland

Hop out that Scat and I caught her
I'm out here with somebody daughter
She callin' me daddy, I'm somebody father

Or put my lips on it like somebody water
The diamond, the glacier, the card in the wallet
She pulled up to fuck me but nobody caught her
She told me that she wasn't feelin' my music
I fucked her, she told me, "It's nobody harder"
And I'm with the G-ski, I need that shit for the freeski

She use to lie on my bed and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski, nigga, you knows me
You ain't believe it, you wanted to toast me
I had extendi as long as a ruler
In case you was coolin' and wanna approach me
Dropped the Bentayga, came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again, I want that tongue again
Stuck it so deep that she cough up her lung again
Five-star bitches, they on the run again, run again
Runnin' in diamonds, they illuminatin' the way that I come again

Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego 
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego 
She heard of my deep stroke

Certified freak ho

Back then, wasn't worried 'bout me though
In the gym tryna work on my free throw
Goddamn
Spending money at the club like Sam's 
Yes, ma'am
She a lil' freak on cam
But she don't put this on the 'Gram 
Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram 
I can't switch on the fam 
Shit's hot, hit the switch on the fan 
This where my head is 
I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings 
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections 
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section 
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession 
I like to call it a passion, I can't be sitting relaxin' 
PG, we getting some traction, I'm at the venue, it's packed in 
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me and she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction, that's my type and she Latin 
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand new sheets for the bed, they satin

You tell me what that means
Make a slick comment and see what that brings
I seen it go down, we can reenact things
Extreme like BMXing
These boys pussy and they PMSing
People in the city see the movement occurring
And say, "My God, I wanna be in that scene"
Damn right, you wanna be in this scene
She at the video tryna be in this scene
Used to fantasize 'bout bein' this seen 
Bluegrass girl, but she got big dreams
Can't touch me, I got instincts
Locked in the house, but I'm plottin' things
I brought a gang to the party with me
Five white boys, but they not NSYNC 
Fuck what y'all think
Fuck everything that you say about me
My dawgs like to play Madden and 2K
But one thing they don't do is play about me
My homeboy Tyler, he play in South Beach
He told me this summer he gon' fix my jumper
I told Boi-1da that we might got a thumper
I been tryna pop, now I'm on like Shumpert 
Now they on my bumper
Green room chock-full of all my comforts
Hotel room like heaven on earth
Got angels in my bed with some all-white covers
Ace Pro, Nemo, Lucci and Quiiso, Shloob, Clay, 2for
And I got a few more I call my brothers
I got a lot of flows and they all like butter, ooh 
You know what that means
I came home nice, but I'm goin' back mean
I'm 'bout to globe-trot when they know a vaccine
Mothafuckers act lost, but they know exactly what's goin' on
Made a mil' and I don't know what to blow it on
I tell the critics, "Shut up," like my show is on
Gave a T-shirt to her, said, "Throw it on"
She one of many high school classmates I'm growin' on 
My peers ain't poppin', they don't know what's goin' wrong
Y'all well dressed, but you ain't got soul and you just can't sew it on
I'm tryna tell y'all boys, I got a few songs I could sell y'all boys
I tried it back then, it was, "Hell nah, boy" 
Now I'm in a box like a Kellogg's toy 
The ones that hate me the most look just like me

I'm sorry, I don't want no drama, nah

In the club smokin' Jack Harlow's gas
But I'm about to do the drugs that Carlos has
Old Miami Vice, 'bout to AT4 it
But I don't show up if they don't pay me for it
New York, party on the eighteenth floor
But her ass so fat that I can't ignore it

But to ride the rides, you gotta be eighteen for it
No games, just some foreplay before it
And the sex so good, she wanna pay me for it, no

I got a Dallas and an H-Town boo
Got a baddie out in Cape Town, too 
Whole gang eatin' steak house food
Get the check, I ain't checkin' what it came out to 
I tell promoters, "I don't talk about the money
You know who to hand the envelope to" 
Big John got the cash and he been thе go-to
Heard the beat, told Nickiе, "Put it in the Pro Tools"
Got a fountain on the chain and it's indigo blue 
Might fuck around and get a gold tooth
I'm a restaurant-goer, never been to Whole Foods
She gon' listen to the song, say, "This shit a whole mood"
I'm in the mountains out West on a tour bus
Textin' this chick I used to mess with 
Got her in the bath, doin' video shoots
Tried to send one to me, but it didn't go through 
And she gon' let me hit it any day now, ooh

I'm in her eardrums talkin' 'bout assets 
“Do you wanna—?” “Yes," hol' up, I ain't even ask yet 
She got her hair done, she finna need it redone 
Boy, that pussy so good 
Stuck it in, damn near almost made me pre-cum 
I let her give me some advice like I need some 
Booked up, tell a dumb bitch, "Read some" 
I'm anointed, I'm the boss
I done came out of pocket so much 
You thought that I was disjointed 
They pointed me towards ya diss
Um, I'm disappointed 
My ex treat me like I ain't there 
What happened to the feelings and love that we still share? 
Just like the girls who got my name tatted and covered up

Shit, she so fineThrough the night
She just want the tip, no advice
On the side of the road, what's the risk? Roll the dice
If they catch us, I don't care 'cause we all gon' die 
Yeah, we all gon' die
I was worried, to be honest, but it's all goin' right
When I first laid eyes, I was awful enticed
And I might be off something, but I'm all in now
She gotta call in now
I don't think that you should work tomorrow
She said, "First of all
I'm still goin' in," like Rich Homie Quan
But with you and me, God, man, it feels so intense
I already seen that movie but I will go again with you
I got a few I been tending to
But tonight, I forgot all about 'em
Through the night
I would try to get it tonight
Yeah, the phone on my head like, "You better do right"
I'm alone in the bed, yeah, I know what you said
Better cope with it
Don't take me for a joke and I won't get a friend that's tryna be more than that
I'm convinced that it's sorta that
When I seen you in the pics, I could tell you was forcin' that
I got time for this
Minus the bullshit, I'm cool now, look at my common sense
And I'm just realizing this
Know my soul isn't trapped
But what's holding me back is the old me, in fact
I'ma get intact, I'ma get it back
Mama, hold me to that
Just, just, just hold me to that
On stack, me and Jack got the city on smack
That's word, huh, that's words
Used to catch 18 all the way to Newburg
It was only me and her, I don't care what you heard
Only me and her, I don't care what you heard

Only thing I'm trying to do is keep this shit jumping
So I turned this motherfucker to a pole vault
Chicken finger plate for the road, dog
Heard that you was working on a mixtape
Really you can keep it like the coleslaw
Bring the beat back like the overalls
Your boyfriend a tool, that's a Kobalt
When I'm in the booth, make the snow fall
Ain't nobody in my class, check the role call
One name on it, bring the beat to me I'ma come skate on it
Something like Timmy, I'ma Wuntayk on it
Boy, I know this shit's hot, no one takes on it
Pre-Med shorty, turn me on like she hit the reset on me

Pair of shoes that got the NB on 'em, make you stare and see 'em
We ain't paying for 'em, nah, you oughta know I'm wearing free ones 
When you ghosting me, I gotta know, is there a reason?
It was so abrupt, I kind of had to think that there would be one 
Conversations out of state, they asking, "Where are we from?"

She want me to serenade her, but you know I'm bashful 
I got all the whipper-snappers and the lil' rascals

Old friends inquiring about the cash flow 
Okay, this kush here in the gaseous state

Pair of shoes that got the NB on 'em, make you stare and see 'em
We ain't paying for 'em, nah, you oughta know I'm wearing free ones 
When you ghosting me, I gotta know, is there a reason?

Moving through the night just like an old coy-
-Yote, low profile, sippin' something, got my piss lookin' like the Oh-hi
Push it 'til it's broke down
Somethin' like my momma when I take the bag home to her
Con artists talkin' like some connoisseurs
If you want the beef we can put them bitches on skewers
She the one I wrote this song for
And she put it on while she puttin' on the contour
Phone calls from the concourse
Long way from home and that pussy what I long for
But, for now I'm on the clock, uh
Give myself off to you right before I knock
Once I'm back home, then you know it's Yung Joc
We gon' set the camcorder up and make a Hitchcock
I'm a uhh, big shot, uh
I can't eat it cold, so I hope this shit's hot
I can't eat the leftovers out the Ziploc
It's a mental thing for me, I can't really explain it
I know we're friends, but it feel like we datin' sometimes
I feel the tension in all the conversations we have
I know the beat ain't really hot 'til I'm pacin' around
And I'm pacin' right now
Yeah, this shit knockin'
And she, and she, she tryin' give noggin 
Tryin' show the youngin' what the tip top is
But see me, I'm just tryin' see what the drip drop is, uh
Hit it once, she say that we been talkin', uh
I don't mind, I'm enjoyin' the company
And it's validatin' for me, fill the void I been strugglin' with
I rock a soldier out of Troy when I'm bussin' this shit
It's an infection I avoid, I been wantin' to kick
But, I been flip floppin', huh
Indecisive how I'm tryin' get poppin' 
Plain cheeseburger, I don't get toppin'

Spokin' word over bass, I be grid lockin'
She was bad so I had to take the bitch shoppin'
Hit the Rollie store to kill time, now we tick tockin', huh
Hurry up before my dick soften
She put the panties on backwards, got her criss crossin', huh

Honey gold diggin' hoe be tryin' to pick pocket

I'm just tryin' to see what the drip drop is, huhI wanna see some ass
I wanna—
Jetson made another one, baby
I wanna see some ass
I wanna see some ass
Baby, can you do it like that?
From the front to the back
She said, "I don't wanna move too fast"
'Til she hit that gas
Ciroc and the puff puff pass
Now the whole squad getting fucked up fast
She said, "Jack, where you been at?"
On the road, but I just got back
And I'm still flyer than a bitch
And ya boyfriend, well he just not that
And I, I don't know how to behave
I'ma tell her be safe
I don't need the pussy, I'ma tell her be safe
I got God with me and he's telling me things
I wanna see some ass
I wanna see some ass
Baby, can you do it like that?
From the front to the back
She said, "I don't wanna move too fast"
'Til she hit that gas
Ciroc and the puff puff pass
Now the whole squad getting fucked up fast
Ooh, I'm just tryna' see something
I ain't gotta say it 'cause they know where we from
I got some money out the ATM, but I'm gonna keep some
Strip club, pre-cum off of the liquor, fell in love with a stripper
Now I'm asking her where she from
As if we gon' be something
I wanna be something
Take my number down, you can hit me if you need some'
Said she got three sons
Do you want four? 'Cause I need one
Do you got whores? 'Cause I'll be one
Going all night like the reruns
I wanna see some ass
I wanna see some ass
Baby, can you do it like that?
From the front to the back
She said, "I don't wanna move too fast"
'Til she hit that gas
Ciroc and the puff puff pass
Now the whole squad getting fucked up fastI don't think we can be friends
I don't think that I can even pretend
We used to be such a hit
Now it just feels like a swing and a miss
You used to think I'm the shit
Sometimes I wish you could meet me again
I know you always believed in the kid
And my music and that I'd succeed and go big
And subsequently I'll be bringing you with
We would get married, and we would be rich
Everything changed, I wasn't the same
Now you think that you believed in a myth
I cannot tell you the reason for this
Summer is coming I'm facing temptations
Maybe I'm selfish and I think with my dick
Remember we spent all of those nights in my basement
I know that I'm really all that you want
Wish you could say "this is all that I need"
I know you see right through all of my fronts
I don't know who I've been trying to be
I do not think that's a problem with us
I just think that is a problem with me, me, me
I don't know when she can stand anymore
I don't know when she can stand anymore
She doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no
She doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no no
No no, no no
No no
No no, no no
I'm sorry we're not what you thought we could be
But it's not what you think
This is way worse than I thought it would be
I know that I'm not what I promised to be
I promised myself I'd be honest with you and I wanted to do this shit honorably
I know that you've always been honest with me
Can't help but think that I took you for granted
Cause if there's a problem then it's gotta be me
I guess I was never prepared for the truth
Telling myself the decision was right
And to have no regrets cause I'm scared that I do
Ohhhhhhhh
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
Ohhhhhhhh
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
You got me thinking like
Yeah, and now we just stuck in the grayest of areas
Thinking back to when I'd say I would marry you
Thinking back to all of them days I would stare at you
Thinking back when you would be drunk at a party
And I was right there I be taking good care of you
I still remember the first time I saw you
And I do not think there was a way of preparing us
For the inevitable, that's how it seems
When you go to college and I chase a dream
Eventually you'll find a man of integrity
Someone that's better you think I could never be, uh
Prolly a guy with some muscles
The type that be smoking and drinking that liquor
Prolly a guy with a beard, prolly a fella who's penis is bigger
I gotta get myself focused again
Sometimes it feels like you're all that I know
I know you think we should only be friends
Cause it might just help us to soften the blow
But I don't think that I can even pretend
I do not think that I'll have that control
I don't know when she can stand anymore
I don't know when she can stand anymore
She doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no
She doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no no
No no, no no
No no
No no, no no
I'm sorry we're not what you thought we could be
But it's not what you think
This is way worse than I thought it would be
I know that I'm not what I promised to be
I promised myself I'd be honest with you and I wanted to do this shit honorably
I know that you've always been honest with me
Can't help but think that I took you for granted
Cause if there's a problem then it's gotta be me
I guess I was never prepared for the truth

And to have no regrets cause I'm scared that I do

Her friend replied, "I don't go to school"
"Okay, what you do?"
"I'm a dancer, and quick question, are you a cancer?"
I said, "Hell nah, where you dance at?"
She said, "Blue Flame, that shit be jam-packed"
I said, "Damn facts, so where y'all mans at?"
They said, "What's that?"
Smiled at each other and they both laughed
"I don't need a man, she my other half

Then they had another laugh

We gon' push more Hank than a King of the Hill 
Tryna finesse the game, on point, shaving grams 
I'ma snake 'em one more time and shed this dead skin

Grey Silverado truck outside my man crib

Same nutsack and the same dick head 
Seen that bitch and we ain't impressed 
Thick brunette and she came from Lex
Phone got bugs and they ain't insects
Feds tuned in when I send my texts
Ain't nobody worried 'bout if I'm next
'Cause they know I'm next
I thank God, I know I'm blessed
I recall when you threw shade
I can let that shit go, I guess
I'm locked in, had to go out less
Everybody act like they know best 
Her boyfriend ain't fresh
Look like someone I'm gon' outdress
She’s so wet, had to hold my breath
Ain't hit since, she know I'm pressed 
Show my chest, let me flex, bitch 
In the flesh, got connects down in Texas 
Pussy juice, side of eggs, that's my breakfast
Sugar mama, 56, off of Craigslist 
Can we have a threesome with your fuckin' best friend?
I ain't talking Florida when I say I'm destined
She ain't know my money taller than a Westin
Hotel, got your bitches checked in
Ex-chick salty just like Chex Mix 
Cop a plane ticket for my new chick once the check hits
I come from a city that is very much eclectic
But it's got another side to it that gets hectic
Shorty that I mess with got a friend that's a detective
She gon' run surveillance just to find out who I've slept with
All my jewelry gifted just like me, ain't bought a necklace
I'm not young and reckless, bitch, I'm cool, calm, and collected

I set trends, next up, no question Ayy, you got me fucked up if you think I'ma fuck up this time, alright
It's the kid, come on, ayy
I rock the tan cargos with the velcro seams
I can't feel the vibration when my cell phone ring
I like to watch them split the swisher, make the 'rillo bleed
I know that Sunny keep a pound inside the L.L. Bean
And this that wasted youth, killing time
Say the truth, feel the vibe
Baby let me bring you 'round my friends, yeah, they the purest
I might act a little different that's just 'cause they give me courage
When I need it
I mean I'm joking but I'm not
Yeah the story of my life, said I play too fucking much
And I say that way too much, guess that still don't justify it
But I been that way forever, I don't feel like even trying to change
She the one I'm tryna' be real with
But this that tick-tock, she ain't got no time for my feelings
I need a pit stop every time I ride with my villains
They up in Big Rock blowing smoke inside the pavilion, you know
Wasted youth, killing time
Say the truth, feel the vibe
Wasted youth
Wasted youth
Wasted youth
Wasted youth
Wasted youth, wasted time
Wish that I could press rewind
Don't fuck with sunshine, stuck in my confines
Yeah, I'm worried 'bout real shit, you worried 'bout punchlines
And I was coolin' with my niggas
Talking 'bout stacking them figures
Wasting my time with them bitches
Chilling, kicking, she gon' stuff them swishers
And I don't even smoke for real but I'ma puff it with her
And we gon' fuck and I ain't gon' see her for a couple weekends
'Cause I been drinking, I been smoking, going off the deep end
She said that she gon' be my baby well I guess it depends
Catch me faded maybe we can see then, maybe we can be friends
If we don't hit it off, I'm sorry
Lately, I been distant, you can cut this shit off
I just been lost in my thoughts
Wasted money, chasing truth
Wasted time, wasted youth
Wasted youth, killing time
Say the truth, feel the vibe
Wasted youth

Three years in with your ex-boyfriend
Y'all tied that knot but it's back undone, oh yeah

You ain't gotta ask where that come from 
I ain't never rocked no Pacsun
I was off the pack at the mall St. Matt

I'm team cap', you was always last
She got good hands and a Allstate ass
I got good kids and they all came fast 
I ain't gotta say it, you can come to the 'Ville
Just ask who's hot, they gon' all say "Jack" 
Tell me stay down but I always have
When I come around, man, they always ask
"How does it feel?" 
Ain't shit to me, it's a walk in the park 
Y'all too smart, can't talk from the heart
I got sauce and it's off of the charts 
Started my night with the light
When I got to the club, I was off of the dark
And I'm on the wave like a dolphin or shark 
Y'all two shots, they was off of the mark 
Keep it raw from the start
That's what she want from me, okay, cool 
My chick love me and she don't make rules
She ain't gotta ask if I'm gon' stay true 
One-take-Jack, I ain't gon' take two 
Urban got tabs and I'm gon' take two
I was in the KY doin' eight-five on the six-five
Dash when I saw a state troop' 
Y'all can't do what we do 
Everybody tryna come do it, reboot
Y'all ain't have faith from the shit back then
But I ain't even trip 'cause I knew it'd be cool, like "Woo"
Ain't shit to me, it's a walk in the park 
Y'all too smart, can't talk from the heart
I got sauce and it's off of the charts 
I've been tryna catch myself off guard
I fuck with you if you get that part
Worser-than-me's never hit that hard
Worser-than-me's never got too far 
I can tell y'all boys not too smart

Oof, had to wait for the dark
Now you tryna pull up, get on two bars
Uh, you can stay to the side, uh
You don't really want no part to this
Fifteen deep and we hard to miss
Name somebody comin' hard as this 
My nuts hang like ornaments
I'm not ready to be in love yet
I just want somebody I can argue with 
Want somebody that's hard to get
That's just life, that's part of it
That's part of it 
That's just life, that's part of it
I said, "Pardon me" 
I got ice all in my arteries, like D'Lo

She from California, said she don't know where the 'Ville is
Shout out to the hometown, I know that they gon' feel this
When I hit the club, I walk in with a small village, and
Nothing's off limits
When you got the sauce, you know they running off with it
Now she actin' freaky, she was coming off timid at first
But I guess it really wasn't authentic, yes, sir
Now she got me, ooh, doin' somersaults in it
Know these fellas always talking but they weren't involved with it
I like me some women, not a bunch of sausages
I put in the work, I know that some of y'all didn't, yes, sir
And they come in all sizes, uh
We got new horizons
I guess I might as well dive in
No, it's not surprisin' the way you switched up
I used to kick it with the kids that rocked that Osiris
Used to rock a patch like a pirate
The garden still private
Drama got a Bentley, let me drive it
I'm a heavy hitter, Darryl Isaacs
And we rocking from side to side
Tell me now if you're trying to ride with me
You know I can find some time just to get
In tune with you, ayy, ayy, ayy
Used to be the one that I idolized
Now I can't see you the same as I used to
I guess I need me a ride or die
Know you get sick of the games 'cause I do too
Late nights, head hurtin'
Open up the red curtains
You don't love me, you just networkin'
I'm still trying to be the best version of me
I got a whip plus room in the front seat
And it's so up-scene
She make me look like 2010 Kris Humphries
Y'all been getting too comfy
I been spending my time going off
Just in case you're wondering, never just one drink
Eighty proof all up in my bloodstream
Used to talk shit, now I wonder what they must think
Blame it on the crushed dreams that we used to all have
All I know is that we can't fall back now
And we rocking from side to side
Tell me now if you're trying to ride with me
You know I can find some time just to get
In tune with you, ayy, ayy, ayy
Used to be the one that I idolized
Now I can't see you the same as I used to
I guess I need me a ride or die

Blamed it on my youth, but I know I've had time 
Now when it comes to you and I, all that I ever did was tell lies
Am I gon' keep this up 'til I die? 
Does it add up when you do the bad stuff? Mm-mm
Time keeps movin' past us
If they gon' shoot, then I pray they end up shootin' past us
Temptations that I knew to pass up, but I didn't
When I said I loved you, know I really thought I meant it
Can I go to Heaven? Is it time to put my bid in?
I'm no longer a kid, I should probably quit the kiddin'
And the playin'
I wanna do the right thing, man, that's all I'm sayin'
I can't keep blamin' entertainment
And the money and thе fame that I been attainin' 
There's a rеason for these girls that I'm entertainin'
I can't keep lettin' shit slide 
Thought that I would change, but I'm the same guy
Blamed it on my youth, but I know I've had time 
Now when it comes to you and I , all that I ever did was tell lies
Am I gon' keep this up 'til I die? 
These are my confessions, couldn't say it to you

I was pillow talking with my ex, she said you not how I remember you
Lost inside the sexting, I forgot who I was ventin' to
My homie's favorite rapper Kanye West since we was little, so I knew that boy a motherfuckin' dropout 'fore he went to school
My shit too clean, turned this to a routine
Yeah I turned this to a routine
Boy, my shit too clean, turned this to a routine
Yeah I turned this to a routine
Take me out of this coma
Tell me now who this person is
Take back my diploma
Lord knows I ain't earn that shit
In the field with them cobras
In the field like it's first and ten
Momma catch my aroma, know my company on that herbal shit
Ain't been home in two weeks
Turn this beat to looseleaf
Going through the mood swings when you care more
She don't make time when she got time we just facetime
But she beautiful, like real talk though
She come right after that 8-9 so I'm stuck on her
I'm so gone off her
Might lay in bed with some other girl and talk about her after I bust on her
Like, what you think I should do?
I was pillow talking with my ex, she said you not how I remember you
Lost inside the sexting, I forgot who I was ventin' to
My homie's favorite rapper Kanye West since we was little, so I knew that boy a motherfuckin' dropout 'for he went to school
My shit too clean, turned this to a routine
Yeah I turned this to a routine
Boy, my shit too clean, turned this to a routine
Yeah I turned this to a routine
Might hit your girl on my daily schedule
Hit the gas, I'm gon' break the pedal
Don't hit my phone 'cause I'm changing levels
Just because we talk and I ain't made a move to get up in your pants don't make you special
I got the pistol though, shit can fit ya throat, just in case you wanna taste the metal
You ain't have to say all that
Damn it, I been on my shit
Since about 11 years old I been setting these goals and I handle them like it ain't shit
My mom introduced me to Outkast and I done examined Aquemini since
I'm in the pocket, they sending the blitz
Know I'm gon' scramble and head for the fence
I done ran through about every option
Don't ask about me, I'm very modest
When I'm in that thing, know I'm cherry poppin'
When I'm in my bag, that's Marry Poppins
Blue and black 1600s, need the blue stacks that's gon' keep coming
I put that on my damn city 'fore I move back and then refund it
I was pillow talking with my ex, she said you not how I remember you
Lost inside the sexting, I forgot who I was ventin' to
My homie's favorite rapper Kanye West since we was little, so I knew that boy a motherfuckin' dropout 'for he went to school
My shit too clean, turned this to a routine
Yeah I turned this to a routine
Boy, my shit too clean, turned this to a routine
Yeah I turned this to a routine
Yeah I turned this to a routine
Yeah I turned this to a routineHol' up
My dad built houses, my mom painted pictures
They both gave it up once I came into the picture
Me, I'm like them, just a fifty-fifty mixture
My mom rode horses, she wish I had a sister
I prefer the pen to a hammer or a brush
But I build things up and my imagery is lush
I used to play soccer but I never had to touch
Basketball, too, but I ain't love it that much
Much of my time's spent lookin' for a rush
Tryna find something to afford me that feeling
I fall in love with girls 'cause they physically appealing
A couple weeks pass and the convos hit a ceiling
I've smoked a fеw blunts, cookies, and runtz
Gotten high enough to know it isn't what I want
Mеt the celebrities, seen through the fronts
Dated one girl and I've seen two at once
I ain't upset to be inside for some months
And get back in touch with the person that I was
Know I've given too much of my time to the chase
Tryna get in touch with a person that I lust
So this the perfect time to hang it up
Used to sleep until noon now at nine, I'm waking up
More time that I'm inside then the less I want to talk
I don't wanna FaceTime, I ain't tryna say, "What's up?"
Careful with the ways that my time is taken up
Bunch of geeks tryna take the shine away from us
Reaching for critiques and they tryna say I suck
Got me reminiscin' back to a time I gave a—
But my skin's gotten thick since then
And my high school crush has done the same thing
So when this blows over and I'm back home
I'ma tell her that I'm really done playin' games
Seven figures in my bank statements
Seven fellas that I'm that stayin' on the same page with
We been shootin' for the stars and our aim's dangerous
Hasn't been a single thing that the gang can't get
My main thing shall remain nameless
Know they ask about her often but I ain't sayin' shit
There's a level of discretion that I'm maintaining
She don't understand it, but she ain't famous
We gon' see who's still around once the game changes
She's a businesswoman, but I got her playing favorites
You ain't rooting for me then I gotta make changes
Ex girls watchin' with a lot of fake pages 
My OG showed me what a Plain Jane is and a bust down is
Now I got a hankering to spend a few thousand
KY used to take me up to Icebox when he'd get his jewelry cleaned
They would ask if they could help me and I say, "I'm just browsing"
Woyne worked at Enterprise Rentals discounted
Ville to the A and back, we was putting miles in
Always wondered to myself if I could really be the leader
Of a group of brown-skinned boys when I'm not brown-skinned
Certain things they grew up on that they get but I don't get
Differences in how we raised make me feel like I don't fit
Not to mention the distance between our parents' houses
Shared some money with 'em so they know I care about 'em
I'm tryna do it right and figure what a fair amount is
But I fantasize 'bout a day that we all swimming in it
No contracts and we independent
Stay close, never start a convo' with "It's been a minute"
'Cause it never will be end of sentence
Nemo, that's my right hand, guides me through my indecisions
Vodka in my left hand takes away my inhibitions
Way too gone, but I'm waking up in mint condition
Ready for whatever, got the troops with me in positionI'm on Eastern Parkway, flyin' on a carpet
Through the yellow lights, I'm gliding on the way to her apartment
And I'm ridin', takin' in the smell of the street
It's night time by the way, but you can tell by the beat
That bass knockin' in my whip, just like some elephant feet
Catch a wave when I'm driving past my elementary
Grew up round the kids that made a belt with a string
And made me feel like I belonged 'cause they could tell I was me
Since then, whew feelin' like I might've lost track
I been thinking too much but I can't help what I think
That shit that's s'posed to make me happy only melts in the heat
If I could freeze it, maybe I could turn myself into steam
Bendin' corners through Cherokee Park
Way I'm driving you would think I was scared of the dark
Another ticket and my momma gon' tear me apart
Well… shit
Young and poppin', I been soakin’ up my adolescence
I took some time to find the balance, now we back in session
Ain't goin' to college, I decided that's a bad investment
But I'm still takin' notes and siftin' through my past and present
I been having trouble socializing
Go out to these parties to make people like me, nah I really don't feel like it
Can't relate to no one, I should stay home they'll miss me
I told this shit to Copelan on the way home from Cincy
He agreed with me, felt the same
Damn, that shit's relieving
Maybe time to reassess my standards for an evening
Shit ain't perfect, we just searching for a plan or just a reason to
Fall in love with life and be a fan of fuckin' breathing
I ain't suicidal, but lately nothin' seems to interest me
And I ain't got the time if it don't gratify me instantly
Thought that I’d be smooth if I ain't smoke or drink
Still I got some vices that be stopping me from focusing
Like wassup with my dopamine, searching for a doper me
I don't want that Adderall, bitch, I ain't got no broken wings
I grew up with the poetry, at 12 I wrote a hot verse
Relying on a pill to do it only means I got worseFirst name, last name, date of birth 
Make a bad bitch sign paperwork 
Once the ink dries, can't say a word
Just another day at work 
Even though I love you, you should say it first 
She in med school, I wanna date a nurse 
I know you been hurt, I don't wanna make it worse
But I know that I'm liable to make it worse, yup 
Oh my, she's so fly 
Nine to five but she wanna be somebody 
I can tell you need somebody 
Put that thing on me, 'cause I need somеbody 
Girl, I'm at the 21c, come find me
I want you to bе the one I keep beside me
Baby, don't stop, can you keep massaging?
I know that you probably think I keep some thotties
Yeah, yeah
But that's besides the point
Got the windows tinted, can't find your boy
Lock it down after hours at a private joint 
They treat me different in the city, I'm the pride and joy
Got a couple old flames that I'm tryna avoid
Got a couple things with me she ain't tried before
But what you waitin' on?
Oh my, she's so fly 
Nine to five but she wanna be somebody 
I can tell you need somebody 
Put that thing on me, 'cause I need somebody
Girl, I'm at the 21c, come find me
I want you to be the one I keep beside me
Baby, don't stop, can you keep massaging?
I know that you probably think I—
First name, last name, date of birth 
Make a bad bitch sign paperwork
Once the ink dries, can't say a word 
Just another day at work 
Even though I love you, you should say it first 
She in med school, I wanna date a nurse 
I know you been hurt, I don't wanna make it worse
But I know that I'm liable to make it worse, yup, ah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Ah-ah
I played you my first hit before it dropped
You were in the driver's seat and I was on the aux'
You made the stank face, that's how I knew it was hot
Lookin' back, I gotta wonder if you would have thought
That my life would've changed like this
That every station in America would play my shit
That I would do a remix and I could take my pick
Of any rappers that I wanted and they'd get on the shit
Hmm, I can't imagine you did
The way you see it, ain't no way that I don't have a new bitch
And it ain't fair, 'cause you know I got a whole lotta friends
That's gon' tell me who they seen you on the avenue with, uh
The playing field ain't level, that's how I engineered it
You don't know when I'ma pop up and when I'm disappearin'
Lately, it's been somethin' I don't really like in your spirit
Wallis Lane made the beat and Nickie Jon engineered it, uh
She ain't flyin' in Spirit
She's a Delta bitch, not the kind with the pyramids 
You got somethin' that I'm tryna experience 
Leavin' comments, got 'em all gettin' curious
Couple phone calls, now we callin' it serious
I say I'm in love when I fall for appearances
It's a lotta clubs tryna call for appearances
Last one I did, I caught a vibe with the bottle girl
Told her that, "I'm leavin', but I'll call when I'm here again"
That was West Virginia, don't know when I'll be there again
People in my circle wonder when I'll be arrogant
Feel like they can't wait to say I stepped out of character 
She said that she wanted me to take care of her 
She said she want me to London and Paris her
She said, "Do your thing," long as I don't embarrass her
Damn, I ain't even get to test out my character 
She ain't flyin' in Spirit
She's a Delta bitch, not the kind with the pyramids
You got somethin' that I'm tryna experience
Leavin' comments, got 'em all gettin' curious
Couple phone calls, now we callin' it serious
I say I'm in love when I fall for appearances
It's a lotta clubs tryna call for appearances
Last one I did, I caught a vibe with the bottle girlAutomatic, it's a habit, you should know it's automatic
I been gettin' to it, I ain't notice y'all was hatin'
Brand new chick, she don't know the occupation
I just wanna know that I can hold a conversation
Ooh, I don't know what y'all debatin'
I been waitin' for you, now I'm runnin' out of patience
Runnin' up a check, tryna run the operation
Went broke in the checking, pulled a hundred out of savings
And I can tell now that you ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
I'ma need somethin' I can calm down from
I'm gon' pull up with the broad, down one
Six months in, I ain't dick her down once
Bitch tryna tell me what you know about me
You don't know nothin', keep it real with me
She said she ain't tryna deal with me
Okay, cool, you could sell that seat
I'm just hopin' she don't feel
'Cause when she do, I don't know what I'ma do
All that shit that y'all was talkin', it was comical
Pull up in your city, for the you know what you tryna do
Uh, 'cause I'm open to it
I know that you miss him but you gon' get through it
I can help with it if you need that, uh
Go and bring that beat back, brr
I don't really listen to the feedback now
Told me that she good, she don't need Jack now
I'm real proud of the steps you took
Just to get to the place that you at today
I couldn't tell it to you straight, I gotta estimate
I wonder if I oughta go out here with the best to say
Now go 'head, get me outta here, I couldn't last a day
I got the city talkin' 'bout me like I passed away
Automatic, it's a habit, you should know it's automatic
I been gettin' to it, I ain't notice y'all was hatin'
Brand new chick, she don't know the occupation
I just wanna know that I can hold a conversation
Ooh, I don't know what y'all debatin'

Bitch tryna tell me what you know about me
You don't know nothin', keep it real with me
She said she ain't tryna deal with me
Okay, cool, you could sell that seat
Ooh, and she felt intrigued 
Motherfucka trippin' off the ectasy 
Mothafucka tryna dip the LMPD 
Go and get your self-esteem 
And she tryna link up, uh
Fuck so much, we got synced up now 
Pulled up in the dinged-up whip
This ain't Pepto-Bis', what this pink stuff is, long tell me
Yeah, you heard me, you ain't feel me
I've been movin', I've been shakin', go and hit me on the celly
Tryna sell me on somethin', well, I hope that shit compellin'
Ever since I've been gone like Kelly, they been tryna tell me
About this and that, I ain't chattin' with you, we ain't goin' tit for tat
Tryna tell me how to get in the barrel
Go and get in the barrel, I'm 'bout to get in that ho, I'm out
Automatic, it's a habit, you should know it's automatic 
I been gettin' to it, I ain't notice y'all was hatin' 
Brand new chick, she don't know the occupation
I just wanna know that I can hold a conversation
Ooh, I don't know what y'all debatin' 
I been waitin' for you, now I'm runnin' out of patience 
Runnin' up a check, tryna run the operation

And I can tell now that you ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
I'ma need somethin' I can calm down from

Six months in, I ain't dick her down once
Bitch tryna tell me what you know about me
You don't know nothin', keep it real with me
She said she ain't tryna deal with me
Okay, cool, you could sell that seatI know you hate the way we drifted
But we both inside this party and we lifted
So what's up?
I'ma sip my drink and crack a big smile
Just to see if I can still get you 'cause it's been a while, yeah
It's been a minute now
Your friends just started listening to my music, but I been in style
You say that I play too much, but we both know I been a child
Asked you when you got to town, you say that you've been in town
That's fucked up
So you just wasn't gon' hit me?
Lookin' like this, you thought it wasn't gon' tempt me?
I'm sorry, but you ain't gotta bar me up
You should come and step into my world just like Narnia
I won't do no harm to you, come on, let's find a quiet spot
How's your sister and your niece? Does she still cry a lot?
Who you talkin' to now? Are y'all 'bout to tie a knot?
Hope not, speak now, hold your peace, I will make that show stop
'Member back when I would come and spend the night at your house
Wake up by myself in bed 'cause you'd be at the stovetop
Walk inside the kitchen, put my hands up, ah, let me stop
Please excuse me, I know these are heavy thoughts
A man's greed can't see the things that he's already got
Fucked it up between us 'cause I wanted you and every thot
Things would only worsen when you'd let me rock
Your bestie tried to warn you, but you told her that, "He said he stopped"
You used to say her man was trash and tell me 'bout the way he'd act
I would shake my head until I realized I'm the same as that
Now I wonder, did she tell her man that I'm a trash dude?
And would he shake his head until he realized he was trash too?
I know this reunion's unexpected, but it's past due
At least if you ask me, I won't ask you
So what you 'bout to do?
I know you hate the way we drifted
But we both inside this party and we lifted
So what's up?Still working
Still waking up looking for real purpose
Still trying to figure out what it's gon' take
Still trying to find connection with some real surface level types
Back when I was young, I used to pedal bikes
Now I'm riding cross country, doing several nights
In and out the Sprinter van, pull up, get the levels right
Get a bite to eat, do the show, and then we settle like
What could be a better life?
But I'm still staring at the ceiling in my bed at night
Thinking 'bout what I don't got yet
Why I'm not hot yet
Why the last project was something that I thought would make me something that I'm not yet
It's all a work in progress
That's what they tell me and I respond with, "I guess"
I been wanting to get something off my chest
But it's not time yet
It might never be time
My kid won't get no screen time
At least that's what I'd like to think
'Cause my childhood was filled with tree climbs
And Oatmeal Creme Pies and looking at the street signs
I guess that he gon' be fine, or she will
I just feel like it's hard to be thrilled in times like this
When our hands can't keep still
And if it's not Insta then it's emails
There's beauty in the details
So I'ma try my best to pay attention to 'em
Spend your day with this and it can get you through it
I ain't seen an institute since I ended schooling
Used to hate it, now my dreams take place in it
Sun shine through the blinds 'til I wake in it
I just got done stretching like the eighth inning
Now it's time to get something 'fore the day's finished
I got
Well wishes in my cellphone from my classmates that let themselves go
Well aware that I'm well known
Know we had a stretch of time between us that you felt close to me, but
It's been a minute since
Did I change or did they rob me of my innocence?
Inner city kids I grew up with, we had some differences
But inside gymnasiums, it's almost like they didn't exist
Time's tickin', my mom's 50
Told me that she been thinkin' 'bout spending time different
It's more precious, what if I took the same method at 21 and adopted it?
Sometimes I feel like I'm tripping for dipping out of town while my pops living still
Palms itching, but this money is not Benadryl
Ain't no pattern to the way I tend to feel
It's all over the place
I'ma lower the shades and sleep in
I ran into a kid I grew up with
He shook my hand and told me, "No one thought you'd do this shit"
I can't relate, but see, I understand
'Cause when they hear me now compared to back then it's like, "Who is this?"
Don't know if I changed, but the music did
In my old shit, I used to just admit things
Now I sit around and wonder, "Is that something you admit?"
'Cause when I hear it, all I do is cringe
I guess I did change
Two years in ATL
Before I moved, I had never got drunk
Now I'm getting tore up like an ACL
Meeting people that my friends idolize
That they only ever get a chance to see on they TL
Artists that they playing through a JBL
In somebody's basement, smoking, getting wasted
Something in the air and I can taste it
2018 I couldn't be on my own
Every night I'd call a girl and fall asleep on the phone
I guess it was how I coped with leaving from home
Discipline, I gotta keep in control
It gets more difficult to rap every day
'Cause it's less and less things that feel like worth saying
Nothing is for sure except life sure ends
I tried to keep that in mind but it's not workin'This a must
Ayy, this a must
Ayy, you a musty bitch
It's a must that I do my damn thing, I'm immune to all the fuss
I been hearin' that
Little bitch, what you starin 'at
Ayy, in the Grand Prix, you know I'm steerin' that, yuh
Fly just like a pterodact, yuh
Trying to ride the dick you know she steering that, yuh
Off course, she said do you love me, of course
Heard that shit you did is all for us
My girl cheated on me down in Gulf Shores
Ayy, spring break, twenty-twenty like the vision
Except the Left Eye, rest in peace, she up in heaven
And I'm with the bros, and we smokin' seven-eleven
Yeah that's gas bitch, you ain't felt the first impression
And I ain't gave it to you yet
Yeah they know I got a gift, yeah they say that I been blessed
If you feel some way about me, go 'head say it with your chest
I ain't worried 'bout a count, know she save it for the best
I got flavors and they fresh, come and see
I'm the one your boyfriend wanna' be
I know when she say she wanna meet, she want the meat
I don't want the box, I just want the company
She get the fellatio, she want the cunnyling'
If they talk about us, just know it ain't come from me
Youngins in the city wondering
How I made it happen, you can do it too, now just believe
Just know that ain't nothin' free
Just know that ain't nothin' free
Just know that ain't nothin' free
I take random trips for no reason
I'm changin' my hoes every season
Hey, six a.m., sunrise beams me
Short lived 'cause a nigga slick sleepy
Three a.m., wit' the guys
Baddie up, she tell me slide
Coca-Cola, plus Henny nights
If you heard me once, probably said it twice
She asked me to Face Time, not tonight
She always complaining, I don't have the time
All I gotta do is pull up, lay the pipe
So dim the lights, hey, Marvin Gaye's playlist, no changes
Dunkin' in that shit like Calvin Cambridge, I tames it
Hey, young and tight, that shit amazin'
She jaded, had the three round she snoring crazy
Wake her ass up and go again is what I'm thinkin'
Ran through, shaky leg, uh
Fuck it, I'ma make a hit today, woah
Sorry I can't leave a tip today, uh
I might take more than a sip today, woah
I know when she say she wanna meet, she want the meat
I don't want the box, I just want the company
She get the fellatio she want the cunnyling'
If they talk about us, just know it ain't come from me
Youngins in the city wondering
How I made it happen, you can do it too, now just believe
Just know that ain't nothin' free
Just know that ain't nothin' free
Just know that ain't nothin' freeI know you tried cryin'
It didn't help nothin', funny how the time flies

I know you wish that you were still a kid
Woke up from a dream wishin' I was in the Ville again
I can see my pops silhouette in everything I do, but I don't see him anymore
It makes me wonder what I even do it for if I don't see him anymore
Will I be happy with the things that I achieve? And what's more
I don't even want to think what's in store for me 
I wrote a note and I'ma leave it on the door
I hope you see it while you're leavin' 'cause I need for you to read it
Know you gave me little space, I think I need a little more
I wrote this for you 'cause you mean a little more to me to me

Made the mistake 
Told her that I had it for one of her friends
Listenin', look on her face

Might be too late for the or-a-gy 
Runnin' the beat 'til the chorus hit

Now it's Sunday night, something just ain't right
I done aged but I still got the same vices
Starting to wonder if I'm ever gon' shut up
You the one I wanna hear from
I don't hit back loved ones
What's that on my back? One ton
Weighing on me 'cause I had love once, but it's gone now
What you do when it's, just you
And your bedroom walls feel like they could fall down?
Let 'em fall down

You ain't gon' tell me if you do
'Cause you don't mind, making me lose my mind
Making me lose my mind
I hope the time I spent back
I tried to brace for impact

Told me that she numb to it, she don't get feelings
I’m a smooth criminal, I'm a slick villain
I already finished, but the dick still in 
Ass fat, she ain't get fillings 
Weezy F. Baby, I don't hit ceilings
And my brodie got a job, yeah, he quit dealing
OGs tryna figure what the kids feelin' 
The flow need penicillin
I been trying to get these pent up feelings off
I could give a fuck about how the fuck you feel about everything
Ice make it sound like I carry change 
She's addicted to the Mary Jane
But she's still got goals like Harry Kane
Pussy hit me like a hurricane
And I came quick but the shit was not embarrassing 
Go and let it marinate
Show packed out and I’m standing on a barricade
Bad chick, black dress with a pair of shades
On the sidewalk, in the crib she don’t wear a thing
She don't wear a thing when we in the crib, you already know, ayy
She don’t wear a thing, yeah, she get naked 'round me, she don't⁠—
Okay, I'm big chillin’ 
Told me that she numb to it, she don't get feelings
I'm a smooth criminal, I'm a slick villain
I already finished, but the dick still in 
Ass fat, she ain't get fillings 
Weezy F. Baby, I don't hit ceilings
And my brodie got a job, yeah, he quit dealing
OGs tryna figure what the kids feelin' 
Just like Fig Newtons
Man, these fellas real sweet, it's no disputin'
No tickets at the door, I can't get you in
Know we used to have something, but it's slick ruined 
Slick talk, can't stop, won't stop until the world pissed off
In a plane every week, I'm getting sick of Biscoffs 
Your chick getting picked off 
Think about life, trying to get the jigsaw put together
They ain't fucking with you 'til it's all put together 
When she stepping out, she looking all put together 
Fuck what the world thinks
Because my dogs know me better 
Because my dogs know me better
And she's a bad motherfucker
How could we not go together?
Okay, I'm big chillin' 
Told me that she numb to it, she don't get feelings
I'm a smooth criminal, I'm a slick villain
I already finished, but the dick still in 
Ass fat, she ain't get fillings 
Weezy F. Baby, I don't hit ceilings
And my brodie got a job, yeah, he quit dealing
OGs tryna figure what the kids feelin' I'm everything that I said I'd be
Everything that I bet I'd be
All the kids that I grew up with
They see me out and congratulate me
Couple of 'em just graduated
Couple of 'em done had a baby
But all of 'em look at my life and say, "That's amazing"
I say thank you like twenty times
Try to talk about somethin' else
Reminisce on some funny time
Truthfully, I'm not comfortable with gettin' all the praise
Even more when y'all get to drinkin' and start tellin' me all the things
That you really think
Likе what I should've done differеntly
What you think of my energy
The downsides that come with being friends with me
I can tell you think this the realest that anybody's ever been with me
But luckily I got PG
And luckily I keep them with me
I keep it humble so you can have a good time
I keep it light so you can have a lil' shine
And I sleep at night just fine
I tried to be kind
Now I'm speakin' my mind
I like how you got the vocals 
Just make 'em like a little less harsh
That's the only thing
But it's in that good world 
Right here? Look
Once people lose touch with ya
They start to hate ya
Start to show you they true nature
Start to be the ones in the comments
That's talkin' 'bout you like you a stranger
Talkin' 'bout ya like y'all didn't have class together
Talkin' like you not humble now or you acting better
Speakin' on the things you've done that they haven't ever
I play the game, you watch the game like Adam Schefter
I created this added pressure
I'm the one that made Jack get better
Tone it down? I could never, ooh
All the greats caught all the hate
All the rappers I love most at one point got called a fake
Everybody seem to know the song that I oughta make
Know the route that I oughta take
I put too much work in to just call it fate
But I keep it humble so you can have a good time
I keep it light so you can have a lil' shine
And I sleep at night just fine
I tried to be kind
Now I'm speakin' my mind
I told your brother this, so I'ma tell you this
This is probably advice I keep giving you frequently
And probably will continue to give it to you frequently because
It's made a difference in my life
Take some moments today during the shoot to look around
Look at the faces of all the people you've brought together
Watch their reactions
Look at the joy on their faces
Take a moment to really absorb what you've created
What you're creating
And try to savor it
I know that you and I are built the same and that it's never enough
There's always some other thing we want to accomplish, but
Just lean back for a moment today
And really comprehend the greatness that you've made
Love you, babeAirplane mode for the evening
Detox lemme go and breathe in
Exhale changing with the seasons
And I heard you say you didn't need friends
I see ya' apathetic and I get it
People don't just do that for no reason
But tell the truth, I think that shit pathetic
Wait until we fall right off the deep end
And I might have to turn this shit around

And I've been wondering if you left me for good, 'cause shit just ain't how it used to be
I sent a text around like midnight or so, you hit me back around two or three
And told me that you feel the same and you get me, but shit just ain't how it used to be
I know that things change, I ain't stupid, no
But maybe if you felt the same, nah it's stupid, nah
I guess I don't know what to say or what I'm doing lately, I've been on a wave
Maybe you were just the one that got away

Woke up to this beat and let that shit knock
She won't give top 'til my dick's out
Clockwork every weekend it's like tick tock
I just hit Atlanta, I got 2for with me
In the cockpit, I might just take 'em to Pluto with me
If Bruno hit me, we might have to fuck with Mars
And they don't want to hear me sing
They told me rap those fucking bars
Well, alright
Trust I ain't forgot how to do it
I been in hibernation trying to fucking stockpile this music
I heard the shit that y'all been dropping is monotonous to me
You got a mic inside your room, well see that's not how you use it
Y'all fucking suck
Keep your distances from me
They should've warned y'all don't be fucking with that kid from Kentucky
I know some hipsters in my city, won't admit that they love me
'Cause back when they were my age, they wasn't shit except ugly
Chandeliers swinging through my comfort zone
Standing here thinking how we gonna blow
She got the manicured fingers with the butt that go
With her jeans, fitted, yeah she covered in Atlanta snow
And as for me, I'm just a young one
Walking, talking hundreds motions with her bout a hundred flows
I've been trying to find the next step
To make my best friends rich
And you been sitting 'round wondering if the blunt is rolled
Y'all come and go with them 20-minute dreams
Blown away by a coincidence and wonder what it means
Check your horoscopes at night and fall in love with what you read
Like the universe gon' have my back in 2017
You ain't 'bout shit
Feeling like I'm Reggie Miller down six
Doing 90 looking out for undercover Crown Vics
Flying out the city, paying zero dollars round trip
Saw her take a picture of me told her take it down quick
Bitch' I'm from the Lou
And they know me when they see me
Ever since I was in school
I should shout out to my father
Know they peep me handle business
All you really gotta know is I get it from that dude
Shooting from the Nazareth
We shooting for that platinum hit
It's Jack from out the Highlands
Going stupid on these tracks again
I'm moving with a pack of kids and supervising acid trips
Rappers getting worse I think they using too much Actavis
It's cool though
I'm just a guest inside the house
Of a culture that ain't mine
And I'm just blessed to be around
These kids be talking bout what's trash
Man I swear that y'all got some nerve
How you gon be most opinionated from the suburbs
I hope they bump this shit on Bardstown
With the windows down
Riding round while the stars out
In the garden now, this the wrong tree to bark down
Finally snapping on these hoes and I don't need no hard count
DamnHonorable C.N.O.T.E

Late at night, I know she slide for me

Ain’t gotta ask, I know they'd die for me
We going up, we going live
And bitch we taking off like five, four, three

She curse me out when she under influence
Speakin' in something that I am not fluent in
Oh it's you again
I can't get rid of ya, I'm glad that we ain't do nothin' on video
TMZ offer you something, you give it up
I know, you can't be trusted
Someone that I was in lust with
And now I can't function
Me, I don't know where the function's at
I got the whip, y'all got the contraband
Where is my conscious at

Can't give a fuck 'bout what you on

I got a crush on a stewardess
Her outfit got somethin' to do with it
Gave her my number, I'm shootin' it
Soon as we landed, I got me a text, ooh
Who is this
Oh wait, I know who it is
Back in '08 I was lollygagging
I'm on the wave, now they call me captain
Go 'head and pay me in proper fashion
I know she hates me, this always happens
I got this one chick on the side
Late at night, I know she slide for me

I was thirty-minutes, he was hopping off the back porch
Tell me what you bad for, tell me who you good to
I'ma need a magazine or something I could look through
I been waiting
For, you to break up with your man
I seen him all on the 'Gram and I ain't really a fan of y'alls
Situation, you gon' get tired, real tired tryna' make sense
Of how the fuck my day spent
Do you got issues with me?
Tell me right now before you get rude with me
She got a knack for it
Even my best friend done fell in love with her before
Ain't gotta act forward
I know what you on, you should know that I done been here before
You need a passport
So when I'm on the road you can pull up, girl, with me on the tour
That sounds fire, takin' out the trash when you pulled up outside
I was lettin' out sighs of relief that I still got some more time with the scenes
Prayin' on, any sign of a weakness
I ain't trippin' in the least bit
You got problems that you need fixed
I got me a couple too, I know what you mean
She was disappearin', I ain't notice a thing
It might be better that way
She got a knack for it
Even my best friend done fell in love with her before
Ain't gotta act forward
I know what you on, you should know I done been here before
She got a knack for it
Even my best friend done fell in love with her before
Ain't gotta act forward
I know what you on, you should know I done been here beforeI became exactly what I wanted to
I became a millionaire at twenty two
Telling girls I love 'em and they love me too
I don't question if they mean it 'cause I know they do
Started being me when I realized it was okay to
Middle school bumping Waka Flocka, "O Let's Do It"
First album and I know just how it's gon' debut
Track three is where I tell her we gon' rendezvous
I'm signed to the gatekeepers
Don't believe the gossip 'cause it ain't true
Half of the dreams I had already came true
And they never told me anything I couldn't do
I got a mirror in my room I like to look into
At seventeen, I never thought that I would look this cute
Classmates can't believe the place I took it to
If I didn't rap then I would be a good masseuse
Fun fact, but it's a hidden talent, 'cause she rubbing my back
All these different cities, I'm becoming sidetracked
She leaving my hotel wearing something I packed
My wardrobe's spread across the whole map
JWise used to book me for the open mics
Kills me when they act like this was overnight
Like we didn't do a tour in a tiny van
Eight deep at the show, it might be eight fans
That builds character, something y'all could probably use more of
If I told the truth to her, I know she'd be tore up
They love it when I rap and I don't even put a chorus
Turkey on ciabatta from the deli, shout to Morris
Thirty grand to show up, we might as well pour up
Fake handshakes, we know you ain't going for us
It's something 'bout your aura
I knowAh man, it's got to that all important time of the show once again
My favorite part of the show, Fire in the Booth
Tonight, we got a sound for you, man
This guy's on fire right now
'Bout to have a wonderful 2020
Man like Jack Harlow in the buildin'
What up? What up? What up? What up? What up?
Ready for this, Jack?
Let's get it
You know what time it is when you hear this track
Yeah, yeah
Woo
Yeah-yeah
I got drugs in my body
My girl, she a hottie
Ten degrees, gettin' faded offa hot totties
Me and my brothers gettin' rich like Roddy
In Atlanta and I'm white like Roddy
I be ridin' shotty with my shorty from NY
She grew up on the train so I taught her how to drive
Yes, I like girls but I'm all about my guys
Climate change real, heard we all about to die
Fuck it then, let's T-up while we can
I've been locked in, I try and free up when I can
Young'uns in the city tryna be us, I'm the man
We been rolling 'round, come and see us while you can
'Cause soon enough, uh
I'ma have to walk around with fellas that be suited up
Know she used to curve me, now she tryna come be cool with us
Y'all got insecurities, it ain't got shit to do with us
Don't care how they view us 'long as they just keep on viewin' us 
Married to the street, you know I'm too in touch
Driven by the fear that I don't do enough
We been moving 'round and now we movin' up
Everybody got opinions but I'm seein' through the bluffs
Listen, I got intuition
I'm a genius in the kitchen, this addict make me efficient
Fell in love with magic, she definitely got a commission
Way too many women, I definitely got an addiction
It's a fact 
Don't know how I'm gonna shake it
Feelin' like I'm goin' crazy
I know I'm goin' crazy
Might just give the chief of police the wrong baby
I kiss her on the mouth like she my son and I'm Tom Brady
Used to diss me, now she wanna date me
I call that a 180, I know it's frustrating
I don't need no more women, I got enough ladies
But ooh, she kinda bad, how 'bout just one maybe?
Some love me, some hate me
Bitches, my cum tasty
We all got big dreams, some got the smarts but they dumb lazy
Seven side-chicks but just one baby
She keep on yappin' and she gon' unchain me
I'm servin' up Dick like I'm Cheney
Bitch, can you blame me?
I went from Old Navy to havin' these clothing brands pay me
Fellas like to talk a lot, wonderin' if I'm soft or not
When you do an awful lot, you don't feel the need
Well, I guess that y'all forgot I'm the illest with the pen
This right here the off-the-top, I'm fucked off a beat
Bitch, I leave the studio and then I hit the waffle spot
Smokin' out the parking lot and then we like to eat
You should know I'm off the rock, bitch, you know I'm insane
We done have plenty fun, now tell me what your friend's name
Jack Harlow in the buildin'
My guy, one take, went in
It felt good, it felt good, Charlie
Bodied the ting right now
It felt good, Charlie
Hey, yo, you got me excited then I was like, "Oh yeah, I wanna come to the waffle spot, hang out in the parking lot 
Do wild stuff
I reckon you got a couple of teens you could line me up with?
What you sayin' Jack, couple of teens you can line me up with?
I only caught a few of those words but I'm feelin' the energy
Ha-haha-haha
Yeah
Hey bro, you went it, I appreciate it, man
Good lookin', thanks for havin' me, brother
Hey, and if people wanna find you on the socials, where can they get you, man?

I'm gettin' green like CeeLo
See bro, I got the cheat codes 
Eatin' over at Il Pastaio, I get a bottle of wine on arrival 
¿Qué pasa? 
You see the bag, that's Prada 
Hmm, de nada 
Baby, you want it? I got it
Got no time for the he say, she say, I take off in a PJ 
Gave my song to the DJ, since then been on replay 
What's poppin'? 
Brand new whip just hopped in 
I got options
I could pass that bitch like Stockton 
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in 
My body got rid of them toxins 
SportsCenter, top ten
I could put the ball in the end zone, put a bad bitch in the friendzone, ooh
This shit sound like an intro, Jetson, give me that tempo, ooh
Told Pooh he a fool with this shit 
Told her don't let her friends know 
In the 'Ville and I move like a don 
Eating fettuccine at Vincenzo's
Me and my 'migos got that free smokeLately I been wondering what the fuck you keep doing
Got me running round in circles shit is fucking confusing
I can tell that you ain't happy you don't wanna go through this
I know you think that I don't love you
I been wanting to prove it, but uh
Lately my mind been on other things
And I want you but I want a few other things
Tell the truth there some girls that I want to bang
I ain't say I'm going to, but I don't wanna change
And I know I'm not giving you the attention you deserve
And I understand if you gotta kick me to the curb
But I know you don't wanna you just wish that this would work
We been going through it, but I guess you live it and you learn
Man this shit is so berserk
Things been bad but they getting kinda worse
We can end things now, before you leave town
But, if I hear something it's gon' hit me where it hurts cause
You say, you say, you say that
We should take a break, we should take a break
And just hope it helps cause
I can't, , I can't, , I can't
I don't wanna think, I don't wanna see
You with no one else
Here I go thinking with my dick again
Here you go making me believe you wanna get with him
You ain't fucking with them fellas
But you love to make me jealous, I been seeming so indifferent
Guessing you ain't getting all the loving that you wish you did
Clearly we got issues you ain't bring to my attention
Yeah until you got fucked, but I'm the one that's fucked up
So don't think that I've been innocent
I know you saw this coming
I know being happy's really all you wanted
I wish we could rewind things back
When you fell in love with a guy named Jack
I know lately I've been trying to have it my way but
Maybe I just really want what I can't have
You say, you say, you say that
We should take a break, we should take a break
And just hope it helps cause
I can't, , I can't, , I can't
I don't wanna think, I don't wanna see
You with no one elseI can't hold your hand this time
I'm the crème de la crème and it's filled to the brim
But you should still go be with him
I can't hold your hand this time
I can't fold my plans this time
We 'bout to hit the cut and get smoky
Hit a couple spots where they know me
I am not a visit to your mommy
I got a couple mamis on call that's about me
Ask about me, ask about me, ooh
She ain't got no boundaries
Don't be surprised, baby, look at where you found me
I'm just as dirty as the shit you see around me
But you can bet they know about us
It's a circus, it's a show around us
Told me she ain't goin' out much
You don't wanna bring your ho around us, 'cause, trust
I'm the crème de la crème and it's filled to the brim
But you should still go be with him
I can't hold your hand this time
I can't fold my plans this time
We 'bout to hit the cut and get smoky 
Hit a couple spots where they know me 
I am not a visit to your mommy
I got a couple mamis on call that's about me
I apologize for making you feel special 
Eighty-proof liquor inside of my blood vessels 
Light beams hit off the side of my watch bezel
Twenty-two and poppin', I feel like I'm on schedule, hey
Don't be so naive
Don't get in your feelings then try me, mmm
Nothin' wrong with a side piece, hey
Go ahead if you tryna leave
'Cause what's a nine to a dime piece?
What's a headache to a youngin tryna find peace?
What's one girl to a couple Siamese? 
What's a chase when they down to come and find me? 
Never seen her 'round, said she went to Shawnee 
Told me, "This ain't really my scene"
Well, baby, this is my party and the drinks all free
So have a good time, it's on me 
'Cause I'm the crème de la crème and it's filled to the brim
But you should still go be with him
I can't hold your hand this time
I can't fold my plans this time
We 'bout to hit the cut and get smoky
Hit a couple spots where they know me
I am not a visit to your mommy
I got a couple mamis on call that's about meWondering how the fuck this shit gon' pan out
All my life I been a sniper in the city I been camped out
They been searching for a hand-out
Prolly heard I was a man now
Like a sneaky pedophile that steady lurking with his pants down
They been fucking with the kid, yeah the youngin is legit
Ace Pro up on production he be coming with the hits
Now she come in to the crib
Got your boyfriend sensing danger
Know my pull-out game is strong
Just tell him we were playing Jenga
Working on escaping my destiny in the cubicle
Recipe for success is just blessing, beats, and a studio
People are fucking twisted, can't never seem to get through to them
Tell me you want me dead but say Rest in Peace at my funeral
Damn, I wish I could call you
These are days I'm gon be looking back on with some nostalgia
But now it seems like you want someone different to call up
And kiss and just ball up and cuddle with
I miss you it's awful
Well I'm good, yeah I'm good
As the time goes by
But I wish I could tell you that I don't mind
If it's wrong, then it's wrong
I hope I know right
I've been searching for someone that I won't find
But I'm good, yeah I'm good
As the time goes by
But I wish I could tell you that I don't mind
If it's wrong, then it's wrong
I hope I know right
I've been searching for someone that I won't find
I been searching for my mother's son
Only got one brother, so I'm talking bout the other one
Trying to keep it friendly with these people getting cumbersome
Y'all keep talking pressure like I'm really out here under some
I'm the future wave creator
Making music, making memories, 'ventually we making paper
Please don't ask your boy for shit
Just ride my dick and thank me later
I ain't got no tips to give you like I fucking hate my waiter
Let's take a trip, yeah
But I don't give a damn about the beach
I'm in Atlanta for the week and we got plans to fucking eat
I'm in the hotel with my brodies doing damage on these beats
I'm writing shit that got that bounce that make you stand up in your seat
Chicken and Waffles
These are days I'm gon be looking back on with some nostalgia
But now it seems like you want someone different to call up
And kiss and just ball up and cuddle with
I miss you it's awful
Well I'm good, yeah I'm good
As the time goes by
But I wish I could tell you that I don't mind
If it's wrong, then it's wrong
I hope I know right
I've been searching for someone that I won't find
But I'm good, yeah I'm good
As the time goes by
But I wish I could tell you that I don't mind
If it's wrong, then it's wrong
I hope I know right
I've been searching for someone that I won't findI just about got the airport mapped out
Flights going in and they going back out
Time flies when you bullshitting at the house
Tryna make sense of your thoughts and your doubts
When I get high, I end up
Thinkin' 'bout things I don't wanna think about
So I'ma hit it twice and I send it back 'round
Gettin' paid for what used to get me sat down
My pops didn't like when I used to act out
Now the whole world wanna see me act out, ayy
Think it's something missing, tryna get it back now
Child that was in me might be kidnapped now
Me and my bro only getting one go
In the cap, then the gown, at least for right now
School nights turned into getting patdowns
Out front the club with the ones who got the torch passed down, passed down
Same way they pass the cognac 'round
Same way they pass the cognac 'round
Yeah, we did this last night
And I think it might be goin' back down
Oh yeah, I think it's goin' back down
Bitch, it's goin' back down
I didn't know that we were goin' that route
If I did, then I would've chilled out
I would've held back 'fore it all went south
Baby, I ain't know that I was gon' blackout
But I'm fucked up now
But I'm fucked up now
But I'm fucked up now
My vices multiplied in the last three-six-five
I can't get carried away
But this bottle that we sharin' just between the two of us
Got me wanting to get married today, so I'ma keep goin'
It's a rude awakening like they leaf blowing
Outside, when I wake up and my mouth dry, it's
'Bout noon and she layin' next to me
When I went to sleep, I ain't calculate the down side, but it's cool
My homegirl got a full scholarship
But she still feel like she wanna call it quits
She don't wanna go to school, she wanna feel somethin'
But if she turn it down, the world gon' make her feel dumb
Throwing money with the ones I got the deal from
I think it's funny how
School nights turned into getting patdowns
Out front the club with the ones who got the torch passed down, passed down
Same way they pass the cognac 'round
Same way they pass the cognac 'round
Yeah, we did this last night
And I think it might be goin' back down
Oh yeah, I think it's goin' back down
Bitch, it's goin' back down
I didn't know that we were goin' that route
If I did, then I would've chilled out
I would've held back 'fore it all went south
Baby, I ain't know that I was gon' blackout
But I'm fucked up now
But I'm fucked up now
But I'm fucked up nowI feel like the Chosen One, I feel like the Chosen One
When I come around, they be actin like they owe me something
I just got the motor running and we still got mo' to come
Treat me like a father, I'm a teach you how to hold a gun
From day one, I been an independent thinker
Not a money on my mind, try and get it to my fingers
And it's not about the money or at least I think it wasn't
But I'm all grown up now she diggin' my demeanor
Attracted to my confidence, swagger hella prominent
It's actually astonishing they mad at my accomplishments
And bitch I got the sauce, you can check inside my kitchen
All you ever gonna find is fucking packets full of condiments
Jack ain't got no common sense, I think something wrong with him
Y'all ain't fucking with we now, I ain't gonna call it quits
If I beat it up I guarantee she tellin' all her friends
And that shit ain't okay with me, so I will never call again
I can hear them talking shit, I feel like it's fuel for me
No I don't wanna pop a pill, that shit isn't cool to me
I don't wanna do a feature please don't ask me for the price
Guarantee it's out your budget, give it up there's more to life
I am not the one that you should be triflin' with
They see I got it now they all wanna ride with the kid
And you ain't got it, so I wish you stop trying and quit
So if you don't love it, if you're not having fun doing it
And you don't really love it, uhh, you're going to give up
And that's what happens to most people actually
If you really look at the ones that ended up you know
"Being successful" unquote in the eyes of society
And the ones that didn't
Often times it's the ones that are successful
Loved what they did so they could persevere
Yeah, errbody wants to be a rapper
All up in my messages they askin "How to be a rapper?"
I can't fucking help you if I could it wouldn't even matter
If you want to get up on my level, you 'gon need a ladder
Really though, man, I swear it's simple to me
If I want to get this music poppin', it's a pimple to me
I can feel the pressure, but I don't feel like it's gettin' to me
When it comes to people that's around me, I be pick and choosing
Yeah, yeah, working like I got no other choice
If you think it's dope, they probably got it from the boy
Heard them talking bout me but they never stepping to me
Cause they know that that's an option
That they probably should avoid
I got people round me don't know how to act
We 'gon spend a weekend in Atlanta, going down and back
Winner's derby weekend in the city
I be working like a thoroughbred, catch me in the studio
I'm going round and round the track
These rappers had me for a second then they lost me
Never leave the studio unless I'm out with Chauncy
'Member when these girls, used to never want to call me
Now I hit the stage and they sexually assault me
Shit been crazy as of late, couple things that we been working on
Gon' take me out the state, all that shit you been tweetin'
Come and say it to my face, if you ain't down here making music
You just taking up the space, so get the fuck outLocked in
Serve em up with that top spin
Young boy I've been taking off
And might pull up in that cockpit
And I... got hits
Don't ask for shit cause we not friends
I spits verses I been working
You mo'fuckers just clocked in
And you doing it but I been did it
My potential that's Ben Simmons
Like blue jeans at the state fair
I might cut you off straight mid-sentence
She love the way that I'm quick with it
We have sex and I'm quick with it
If I put it in with no condom on
Then I might last like 10 minutes
On a good day
But baby it's cool we can do it again
This is the moment and this is the year
I'm predicting that I'll prolly be losing some friends
Please do not tell me about all of the bullshit
That y'all have been doing and who has been with
I feel like I should have been famous a year ago
I ain't got interest into just shooting the shits 
When are we doing it big?
They made it cool and you ruined it quick
I got a hit's I don't usually miss
All of the shit you'll be shooting the bricks
It's crazy to me that you think this shits working
We don't give a fuck about you and your clique
All that I need is a year
And I swear the whole country gon' wonder like
"Who is this kid?"
I remember in the morning
When I take the bus to school
I wondered to myself
If this is how it has to be
I would take my finger
Write my name up on the window
Thinking one day
That's gon' be up on a magazine
I remember in the morning
When I take the bus to school
I wondered to myself
If this is how it has to be
I would take my finger
Write my name up on the window
Thinking one day
That's gon' be up on a magazine
Been about a week now
Been sleep deprived
Teachers' see me I'm easing by
C's and D's I don't need to try
But that piece of mind's what I need to find
And these people 'round me don't help
I've been dreaming like I'm still twelve
I was thinking 'bout what I want to be
I been redefining myself
Watch me as I break the ceiling
Watch me as I make a million
I think yo girl faking feelings
She just want to date a real one
I'm the man that got the hits
I think I should get payed to kill him
Pigment look like sour cream
They treat me like I'm Jason Williams
I'm trying to get to the top of the pyramid
Obvious to me you not really serious
You can not sit with me
Do this shit differently
If you pick Sprite Ima cop the Sierra Mist
I feel like Hell isn't as hot as my lyrics is
Tell them to give me my chops as a lyricist
All of these rappers look nervous as fuck to me
Like when your girlfriend ain't gotten her period 
Yeah I can tell it's a struggle for you
Seeing this happen with me and this rapping
I'm doing just what I been wanted to do
I did not bring 'em a thing in the spring
So we gon see now what the summer can do
Only way they get themselves into shape
Is I bring in the facts and they run from the truth
I remember in the morning
When I take the bus to school
I wondered to myself
If this is how it has to be
I would take my finger
Write my name up on the window
Thinking one day
That's gon' be up on a magazine
I remember in the morning
When I take the bus to school
I wondered to myself
If this is how it has to be
I would take my finger
Write my name up on the window
Thinking one day
That's gon' be up on a magazineYou cheap, cheap so you freak, freak when you throw up I just throw up 
My bitch too pretty askin' when I’ll grow up I don't show up

Might just have to go to the dealer, ship
And cop something
Shout out to my pops, whole lotta sauce that I got from him
Reminiscing on times we was all youngins
In the function, late-night til' the cops coming
Back then, they was acting, like we wouldn't be shit, but now it's packed in
Quit talking, like you know me
Because you don't know a thing about Jack, man
In class, I was zoned out, I ain't learn how to multiply fractions
I was leaving my backpack at the crib, can't trip now cause the whole bags in
No acting, this is real life
Tell me what it is what it feels like
Tell me is it wet is it real tight
Can I slide in with my lil' guy?
I know it's been a minute but I'm still fly
At Derby with a bow tie on like Bill Nye
I'm with your girl she a real vibe
We just had a picnic on the hillside
Last year was broken now this year they tell me
That there ain't shit they can tell me
Y'all hear the click of the tele'

Bitch I'm from the 502 and I rep it to the fullest
Feeling like it wouldn't hurt to step in front of bullets
I'm the man now you the type to instagram pictures
With your hand up on the trigger but you never want to pull it
But yo, I'm not gettin' mixed up in that racket
It's intimidating, I'm just trying to pick apart the madness
I'm just wondering where you kids are getting semi-automatics
Do your parents buy them for you just to give to ya'll as presents
I'm just curious, but Ima get back to this rappin'
And talk about the fact I'm doing shit you can't imagine
Ask your Mom about me homie
She been giving me that action
Had a thing ever since she used to pick me up from practice
But I'm done with asking questions
I'm usually pretty cautious but tonight I'm acting reckless
And I know the clock is ticking on my youth and adolescence
I feel like if I just blink it could be gone in half a second
So I, take advantage of these moments 'fore I lose them
And the mood to be rebellious even I know it's stupid
I don't know what's on my mind right now
I'm hoping I don't lose it
Just came up in this bitch to go and show you how I do it
H-A-R-L-O-W
If I want it then I got it what the Hell you gonna do
She told me that I'm handsome and I'm hella fucking cute
Know these fellas can't believe it, but I'm telling y'all the truth
Take her so quick they gon' call that shit burglary
And I'm so finally handsome thought I got plastic surgery
Tell them take a pull of bleach
And have a shot glass of mercury
You wanna see me quit
You prolly gonna have to murder me but
Please don't, I like living all this
Rhyme spinning gotta fellas mind spinning
Got ya girl up in my whip she wanna take a ride in it
Couple hours go by she asking, "What time is it?"
Uhh, she said I'm nerdy but attractive and I'm charming
Yeah she liked 'fore she heard I was a rapper
This my life and I'm just living 'fore we turn to the next chapter
Scheming like a stallion steady lurking in the patches
Wishing that my first name coulda been Lorenzo
Mixtape dropped but I'm still getting friendzoned
Mixtape dropped but I still haven't hit though
At this point I'm praying for some neck no lymph-nodes
Spit flow, get dough
That is the career path
Told them I'm a rapper, but they ain't tryna hear that
Clear path to the destination I've been dreaming 'bout
If you got directions for me go ahead and leave them out
I'm trying to focus on what matters to me
I understand the value of a Masters degree
But that ain't for me
Nah it just ain't cool and just like everybody else
Man I hate school, this shit is wack
Every single day is like Hell for me
Sitting there for seven hours waiting for a bell to ring
Honestly it's not like I'm not trying to learn
It's that the school system's killing my desire to learn
But I ain't one to talk about taking action
Cause if I really cared I would make it happen
The less I fuck around then the more I know
But I refuse to buckle down for a 4.0
Cause I been looking but I haven't found me any patience for
Anything that has to do with balancing equations or
Stoichiometry, Pythagoream theorem
I'm, looking at my teacher but don't actually hear them
To be honest with you
I've been feeling like a misfit
I know my life passion and I really think I'm gifted
I know my teacher thinks that I must really be dipshit
I guess I got to show em what's really realistic
Really realistic
Guess I got to show what's really realistic
Bitch I'm from the 502
Reppin' to the fullest
H-A-R-L-O-WCan't call it
I don't know what to say about this night we been having
She throwing that ass, like it's a javelin
I'm down for the challenge
I'm out for the summer
Come and see me while I'm accessible
Don't get mad 'cause I had to check the pulse
Paid it for her, I ain't checkin' for the boy, yeah
Low fuel, I'ma pump it up to full, yeah
First impression, I already got you full, yeah
I got more in store, I don't read no horoscopes, yeah
Hibachi in the afternoon, I pull up 'fore it's closed, yeah
Wake up early, listening to Norah Jones, yeah
Don't know why y'all throwing that shade
I don't know why y'all wanna be backstage so bad
And your shit cracking
Reese Witherspoon with me, told her get back in
Can't call it
I don't know what to say about this night we been having
She throwing that ass, like it's a javelin

Don't get mad 'cause I had to check the pulse
Paid it for her, I ain't checkin' for the boy, yeah
Low fuel, I'ma pump it up to full, yeah
Quit talking
I don't want to hear about all the opinions that y'all been keeping
I got me a couple I like to see on the weekends
I keep it casual but they like to be on the deep end sometimes
Handle that case by case
Know they want me make the same face, oh
Without a trace, eh
Without a trace, eh
Without a-
Can't call it
I don't know what to say about this night we been having
She throwing that ass, like it's a javelin
I'm down for the challenge
I'm out for the summer
Come and see me while I'm accessible
Don't get mad 'cause I had to check the pulse
Paid it for her, I ain't checkin' for the boy, yeah
Low fuel, I'ma pump it up to full, yeahIt ain't nothin' to a boss 
The fellas you be with, they got you huffin' the exhaust 
Wonder how we do it, man, it's somethin' in the sauce 
Butterflies in my stomach when she touchin' on my draws 
All my brothers dressin' like they comin' out the closet 
Prolly why we starin' at discussion when we floss 
Quite the contrary, though, we bussin' on your broads 
We don't ever cuff 'em, no, we fuck 'em and don't call, like some 
 Like some motherfuckin' dawgs 
That's just how I'm livin', it ain't nothin' we was taught 
Or maybe shit it was, I guеss I'm gon' go get some thought 
I need to cash in the bank until it's busting' out thе vault 
They don't wanna see me ball 
Came up out the city, had 'em cussin' at the walls 
I'm just a youngin' with some flaws
I got people takin' pictures while I'm struttin' through the mall
What? What?
They ain't pasta with the sauce 
That's why they got robbed, repercussions when they floss 
Get your mind right, disconnect from all those orbs 
Friend or foe, you hear me? That's selection with your heart, boy 
Yeah, pray we never take another loss 
Never had to pay for no protection from the park 
Why, you the type that's scared of your reflection in the dark
You got any misconceptions, let's address it from the start, nigga
Baby hopin' that I plug 
If I hit her with it, better act like she in love 
These niggas in their feelings, bro, I blame it on the drugs
Come to California, get to knuckin' if you buck, bruh 
Diamond Lane, throw it, boy 
Grindin' with precision, keep the gang goin' up
GRAMMYs or the 'Grams, we ain't stuntin' for no flick shit
But we still do it for the cam, shoutout Dipset 
Stop playin'
It ain't nothin' to a boss 
The fellas you be with, they got you huffin' the exhaust 
Wonder how we do it, man, it's somethin' in the sauce

I got people takin' pictures while I'm struttin' through the mall
I'm 'bout to heavy bag this shit
Lock a nigga state to state with a bag of bricks, he know
Possible he could get cracked with this
But I'm on my midnight train, on my Gladys shit
He thought get it brackin' for my establishment
Under full court pressure, fade back and swish
B-roll, keep a redbone stallion for sport
Keep a lawyer on retainer, so I'm smilin' in court
He will be suprised what a hunnid bill dollar'll do
Meet your demands, pull up, talkin' to community property
If you got all the lottery and you bought all the property
It's a pussy monopoly, you better wake up
Better recognize what time is today
Whole time gotta survive, that's the play
It seems like I'm only two bars away
Eastside, five star like I'm on GTATightrope
All of this shit, off the top rope

Momma called
Asked me if it's worth it to me
I’ll be honest, not at all
This ain't what I thought it was
I guess don't get me wrong, I know I'm blessed
Sometimes I'm tempted just to hit that fucking ganja for the stress, but
I make that pussy my getaway vehicle
She give it up, but she wish I was dateable
I don't say much when I notice the pain on her face
It reminds me of kids I would see in school
Empathy coming in waves
Then it just tends to be something that fades
Me, I been searching for something that lasts
Don't want no remedy numbing the pain
Told me her wrist is in love with the blade
Damn, I wish there was something I could say
I know this life doesn't come with a key
I know the kitchen don't come with a maid
I got the hits they be wanting to play
Fuck with the vision is what they gon’ say
Whether it's positive or that shits negative
Bet they go mention my mothafuckin’ name

Ending the night like it's bravoSaid I'm from the 5-0
I don't fuck with 5-0
Whipping through your neighborhood
They telling me to drive slow, I don't
Man I swear I'm in my zone
Looking in the mirror, someone tell me where the time goes
Yeah I got the key in the ignition
Yeah I'm bout my business
Yeah I know you say I'm on a mission
Yeah you know I'm disrespectful
I be creeping through the kitchen
Up at 2AM, I'm tiptoeing
Reaching to the fridge to get some orange juice
Yeah I'm sipping straight out the jug
No my family wouldn't like it
But I ain't give a fuck
Say what you want
Don't nobody do like this
I go from cautious to reckless soon as the moonlight hits
Now we ridin' round, ridin' round
Taking in the sights and sounds of this side of town
Looking for experience that I can write about
And I take advantage of my time 'fore my time is out
Cause I said I'm
Said I'm from the 5-0
I don't fuck with 5-0
Whipping through your neighborhood
They telling me to drive slow, I don't
Man I swear I'm in my zone
Looking in the mirror, someone tell me where the time goes
Said I'm from the 5-0
I don't fuck with 5-0
Whipping through your neighborhood
They telling me to drive slow, I don't
Man I swear I'm in my zone
Looking in the mirror, someone tell me where the time goes
I'm so well-behaved, respectful til the sun goes down
After that there really ain't no telling what's going down
They giving us advice
But we living how we like
People saying what the fuck
But we ain't givin' under night
When my parents get to asking
Bout what we've been busy doing
It's a song about everything
I don't never mention to 'em
Shit is grown, we've been plotting in an empty lot park
Speeding down the street, I'm looking out for cop cars
Just a couple blocks away from the police station
And I ain't fucking with the pigs, like I don't eat bacon
Always had trouble respecting limits
Tonight is such a blessing, I wish it was never-
Said I'm from the 5-0
I don't fuck with 5-0
Whipping through your neighborhood
They telling me to drive slow, I don't
Man I swear I'm in my zone
Looking in the mirror, someone tell me where the time goes
Said I'm from the 5-0
I don't fuck with 5-0
Whipping through your neighborhood
They telling me to drive slow, I don't
Man I swear I'm in my zone
Looking in the mirror, someone tell me where the time goesWhat's the word, what's the word
I been on point, kept my herb to the curb
We just went to workin', told them that we quit
So, now I'm trying to get it for a herb selling herb
I'm the worst like syrup on the shirt
Told her how I feel, I ain't sure about the words
It ain't go so well, I ain't sure what the verdict is
But I don't think that I be splurgin' to her anymore
They tried to burglar the flow
Went to high school, I ain't learn nothing, no
Teachers on my back like the burgundy gold on the football jerseys
I ain't worried 'bout it though
'Cause I'm— 'cause I'm certainly dope
Swerving 'round town hitting curbs in the road
Said she can't pull up, she got church in the morn'
I'm a smooth operator with the surgical flow, on some—
On some slick shit
She gon' send them nudes, she don't ask me for no dick pics
But if she did, I ain't tripping, I'ma send it
Pick her up at nine, take her out like an appendix
I got a couple brothers with me trying to get rich
And we 'bout to blow, know you probably heard the tick-tick
On the beat I'm doing kick flips
She ain't got the Rollie but you know she got the Fitbit
And she keepin' track of them steps
I was out the gym but we back doing reps
Ain't no dumbbells but I'm still going dumb
On these damn bells and these motherfucking drums
I'm a spy kid, you's a motherfucking thumb
And I'm in the Ville like a young Denny Crum
Getting to the bread and we taking every crumb
Getting to the bread and I'm— and I'm feeling like him
And I'm feeling like Kim, Possible
Thirty-five and she fine, I'm adoptable
I got young chicks tryna make the condom full
But I know they only want me for the conjugal
I can't do it, but you can make your back St. Louis
Go and arch that, show it to a youngin like Car Fax
We gon' be some legends it ain't far fetched
Key to the city and it came with a TARC passPale skinned sunburnt got me lookin' two toned
Specs on no contacts like a new phone
Lookin' in the mirror man I'm too grown
Pubes so long it's like my dick got a Jew fro
And my girl never ask me to trim it
That's real shit go ahead imagine the image
I'm the man you ain't even got to ask if I'm with it
And you ain't ready for the game
Go on back to the scrimmage
Lookin' pissed off when they rollin' past me
Tell the truth I ain't even know we had beef
I guess it must be cause the flow is nasty
Said it's H.A.R. and she know the last three
Woke up this morning feeling halfway optimistic
And until I got to school I was glad that I was livin'
Shits depressing every class I'm feelin' distant
I can't focus when I know I'll just be rappin' for a living
Tryna' get my groove on like I'm Kuzco
Drop a new song then I move dope
Young Frank Underwood these rappers Peter Russo
Won't stop till I'm big ballin like Manute Bol
Tell em keep on moving the belt
So these manufactured rappers looking stupid as hell
I wonder what it's like to not be true to yourself
Cause I've been doing my thing and I've been doing it well
I'm the man in my city they like damn when they see me
Mini vans full of fans and they playing my CD
At my shows on they toes tryna stand up and see me
If these neighborhood kids had the chance
They would be me yup
Pale skinned sunburnt got me lookin' two toned
Specs on no contacts like a new phone
Specs on no contacts like a new phone
Fresh up out the oven Ima serve it crispy
I know these rappers wish that they was working with me
I know most these soccer moms prolly turning fifty
But I'm on the sidelines and they flirting with me
Touching on my biceps askin if I've grown
Playing with my curls and she laughing at my jokes
I can tell she want it Ima take it if I get the chance
Next thing I know I'm in the back of the mini van
Young Harlow I got the sauce boy
Feeling like a boss Rick Ross voice 
Putting bets against me that's the wrong choice
Whole team wavey yeah we looking like a convoy
Swagger on a hundred fifty
I hear them talk a lot but they ain't fucking with me
I think these local artists need another city
Cause I ain't backing down until they come and get me
I'm the man in my city they like damn when they see me
Mini vans full of fans and they playing my CD
At my shows on they toes tryna stand up and see me
If these neighborhood kids had the chance they would be me
Pale skinned sunburnt got me lookin' two toned
Specs on no contacts like a new phone
Specs on no contacts like a new phoneDJ Money D, Jack Harlow, wassup? 
You might be one of the best in the city
Halloween, Thanksgiving, St. Patrick's Day... 
Y'all can't even touch me
Bet when I make it, they'll say I got lucky 
These rappers be talking, and think that we care
When they say they got money 
She say that she want me
Remember when she used to say that I'm ugly 
I been on the come up, the city
They know me I came from Kentucky 
I been in the 'Ville
I heard what they talking, that shit isn't real
I been to New York, I been in that office
I'll tell ya the truth, we ain't finish the deal 
Guess they ain't think that the kid was for real
Y'all gon' regret it, I promise you that
But I ain't trippin', I been with the vision
And honestly though, I am not lookin' back
Jumpman, jumpman, jumpman
Yeah, I'm too talented
I ain't got no Jordan's, I rock New Balances 
I been doin' my thing, now tell me who doubted it 
If you in your comfort zone, you bout to move out of it 
Y'all want some pajamas? 
Sleeping on me but the sun is upon us
Wake up, by god, I'm so fucking astonished
I'm sorry, the fact is I'm gonna be honest
Not from the hood, but you know what's good
When ya girl on top, and I'm come from the bottom
Been to the future, I've seen what it's like
I can tell you right now, we gon' fuck up some commas
You can trust that I been dope
Everybody love to go nuts when I spit flow
Know they want me stop
But I'm so locked in, gotta bust the window
But it don't make sense, I would think by now
I could pull any chick with the flick of a wrist
But it ain't like that cause a lot of girls
Still got me stuck in the friend zone 
It's a tragic reality
Bet they come through when I'm stackin' a salary
All that I want is the fame and success
And my dad to be proud of me
I'm glad that they doubted me
Really, I can't wait to flex on these lames
All of these fellas be tellin' me how much
We must be alike, we were never the same
All of y'all thirsty, might see a mirage 
Ya girl hit me up, say she think that I'm hot 
Said she been stressing, she need a massage
Told her come thru, she can sneak in the garage
Ya boyfriend a fan of me
Better not tell him that I'm in your fantasies 
He fuck with my music but if he finds out
He gon' wanna put hands on me, yah
Jumpman, jumpman, jumpman
Yeah, we back to basics 
I saw the opportunity and had to take it 
I know they can't believe I haven't graduated
I was 'bout to pace myself but I ain't had the patience 
Jumpman, jumpman, jumpman
DJ Money D, all nightCreepin' down the avenue
Neighbors looking out the window, watchin' as I'm passin' through
Bass bumpin' while I'm ridin' with a pack of goons
Mobbin' through the city all we ever do is act a fool
I ain't going back to school, yeah I swear I really mean it
Never gave a fuck about my grades and yet I'm still a genius
If I ever said I like you that was real facetious
All these girls just say I'm handsome
Bet they wanna feel my penis
Life is such a slippery slope
If I did it once I probably did it some more
If you tell me don't do it, I'm gon' give it a go
And if it's Friday night I won't be sittin' at home
So meet me at Qudoba, I'm gon' roll up it ain't nothin' to me
Pinto beans in my burrito, roll it up and shove it in me
Then we hit the spot, I roll it up, and then you puff it quickly
Rollin' with my homies cause they keep that shit one-hunned fifty
Let's go
Man, you know we do this errynight
Imma keep on movin' till I'm paralyzed
I won't shed a tear until my parents die, swear to god
Got the whole neighborhood terrified
Ain't no turnin' the key
I got this shit locked down and it's workin' for me
Probably heard I'm a beast, that's the word on the street
Controversial with the verses, been disturbing the peace
And lately I been learnin' bout the birds and the bees
Dropped a mix tape and lost my virginity
All this shit talkin' ain't discouragin' me
Cause I know what I envision's what I'm certain to be
Yeah we be movin' so anonymously
Yup, tell 'em no limits when you ridin' with me
You kinda like me except you not as crispy
We up at Applebees probably droppin' fifty
And I been the type to leave a generous ass tip too
I ain't got no problems so please tell me what's the issue
I don't need opinions all them shits have been distorted
I ain't trippin' over nothin' worry bout it in the mornin'
Let's go
Man, you know we do this errynight
Imma keep on movin' till I'm paralyzed
I won't shed a tear until my parents die, swear to god
Got the whole neighborhood terrifiedWelcome to the season finale
Gotta move without mistakes 'cause they keepin' a tally
We had plans of makin' millions, then leavin' for Cali'
Now the city's on fire, even in Cali', postponed
Last night the people learned how to throw stones
So they shootin' gas at 'em to make sure they go home
In the past, it ain't last, but it's all changed
The word is un-turned, how we leavin' no stone
Killed him outside and they left him stone-cold
Left 'em on the street and left his family with a broke home
Barbecue man with a business, home grown
Even gave away plates to the fellas on patrol
Everybody knows that never tell you, "I don't know"
Stories for my grandkids, I can't tell if I don't go
Did you come to smash your skateboard against the glass
Or are you down for the cause? It's hard to tell in all the smoke
These times got me readin' the Times
Lord knows my whole life we been seein' the signs
Rather turn a blind eye just to think that it's fine
Is the change gon' come and if it does, will we see it in time?
There's men that went to war and put their dreamin' aside
Before they left, found a girl to put their semen inside
Knowin' well a child's all that they leavin' behind
We keep it goin' 'til it's the end of timeYoung BL$$D, boy, you saucin'

My body got rid of them toxins 
SportsCenter, top ten
I could put the ball in the end zone, put a bad bitch in the friendzone, ooh
This shit sound like an intro, Jetson, give me that tempo, ooh
Told Pooh he a fool with this shit 
Told her don't let her friends know 
In the 'Ville and I move like a don 
Eating fettuccine at Vincenzo's
Me and my 'migos got that free smoke
On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls 
Dark-haired bitch and she look like Shego 
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego 
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, "Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?"
Hurt when I deep throat
Hurt when I deep throat
Hurt when I deep throat
Hurt when I deep throat
What's poppin'?Eh, yeah, eh, uh
I'm on hiatus and they mad, huh
'Nother city with the bag, huh
I ain't had to use the mass, huh
Make the whip forty dash home
I'm like Houston with the blast off
Plus my muse with the bad walk
Good news when the cash talk
Making moves like a 
Melrose, shot two  revolve
And my bag all uniform
Let the foreign in 
Face off, dark knight, still renaissance
Late night dreaming movie scores
In my mind like the world yours
Plus my mind like world tour
Plug talk like bonjour
Shorty off the  weight, she on all fours
It was just a Monday, she was all for it
And she said she knew I was Pisces 
Girl I swear you hit me like a like a light beam 
Told my momma I quit swerving at high speeds 
Mobbing in a tree, been looking bright green
Oh, shit she said things don't change
We call bullshit but I can't complain
'Cause I'm a culprit, they don't play those games
Let's take a road trip, Imma change my ways
Bitch, I call the shots I think I might bring
Fantasize about to call them pipe dreams
My brothers, they make music and some tight beats
I think only one of us can sight read
Never been a clone of fucking hype beasts
All that shit y'all love just don't entice me
I need a woman that can show me what this life means
That's at the park on Sunday morning, doing tai chi
Imma fuck my ex while she on winter break
Yeah, Imma take this new girl on a dinner date
Yeah, Imma take the interstate and kick it with this chick that's from a different state
I bet she thinks that I'm expecting sex now
Little does she know if I was expecting sex, I would have made that clear before I left town
Hold up, Beck 'em with the vibes
Should be complimentary, got that hotel breakfast every time
And she said she knew I was Pisces 
Girl I swear you hit me like a like a light beam 
Told my momma I quit swerving at high speeds 
Mobbing in a tree, been looking bright green
Oh, shit she said things don't change
We call bullshit but I can't complain
'Cause I'm a culprit, they don't play those games
Let's take a road trip, Imma change my waysFunk Flex, what's going on?
She can’t help her horniness
I can’t judge her boyfriend; he can’t help his corniness
I envisioned myself on the top and it was glorious
All I want is twenty mil' and Maddy from Euphoria
Back in middle school, I did my thing in auditoriums
Now I fuck it up inside the club until it’s 4 A.M
Me, I like to kick it with the OGs and historians
Reminiscing on the day they found out that Notorious
Had passed away
G just took me to the island, Cast Away
I got tunnel vision, I got cash to make
She won’t pull up on me at the hotel
I'd be better off if I just masturbate
Used to catch hate from my classmates
Hard to fuck with you ever since you left a bad taste
Took a ATL shorty on the day to Cascade
Now she coming over washing dishes just like cascade
Fast pace, welcome to the fast lane
Need to find a building with a preacher and a glass stain
Just to get forgiveness for my sins and all my past ways
Told 'em treat my forehead just like an ash tray
I need all that
Y’all had a run and it was fun but it’s a new era
No baseball cap
Tell these old heads go ahead and fall back
She think that we bout to have some unprotected drunk sex
But you know I always put the hat on like I’m Funk Flex
Bitches like to party in the 'Ville but they be from Plex
You think that I’m poppin', ha, wait time see what comes next
I’m talking stupid money, dumb checks
Fans at the show, they holding posters up like thumb tacks
Rappers got a short-man syndrome and a God complex
They want me finished, but I’m not done yet
2019, I hadn’t got one yet
If you ask me now, do I got one? Yes
First draft pick, number one prospect
House party out in Prospect
My brothers frustrated, told 'em trust the process
My oxygen polluted and my food is processed
These are dark times, but I digress
We gotta keep living
It’s going down in the city like it’s descending
I heard that bullets flying with a lot of precision
Once you winning they don’t wanna see you keep winning
No wonder Bryson took his talents to Miami, like the decision
Shout out DJ Camo out in D.C. cause he keep spinnin'
I got lots of drama in my life like I’m Tyree Simmons
Motherfuckers acting like they 'bout it, but they pretending
Hopped on a jet and went to sleep in it
Switch on me, major bed you gotta sleep in it
I got my electrolytes replenished
'Bout to fuck the game up, I’m going deep in itSmile for the camera
I don got my bands up
Hit it for my flight leaves nothing but my pants up
All the women fans of
High already stanzas
I got me a cougar and she look just like Sandra
Bullock
Put the city on to the fullest
Play it like the coolest but i be acting foolish
I got pretty girl on my to do list
Crib got a pool but i don’t know where the pool is
Hey jack who’s this don’t be such a nuisance
Said she like my chain wanna rock it like houston
Everybody boostin everybody scamming henny make me throw up like uncooked salmon
Go grizz did the beat and he got it jammin last man standin
Dime like cannon
Shrooms in the lands and party at the mansion imma just bounce if you can’t let my mans in
So let em in let em in sedative settin' in
I took medicine that wasn’t prescribed but there’s no evidence
Except for this rap
So it won’t ever get released
Imma dog imma beast
She wanna have a talk and i dread it like keith
Once i get the bag then i’m gonna break lease
Then i’m gonna break bread with my brothers let’s feast
Round table horses in the stable
Shorty in quebec and she sweet like maple
I be tryna figure out everybody’s angle
Got more fans up in cincci then the bengalsYoung boy, big dreams, ain't nobody got those no more
All these motherfuckers wanna ride my wave
That's cool if it floats your boat
People be living vicariously through me
Say you my friend, but I swear you a groupie
I am myself, I am like no one else
So there's really no use in comparin' to me
Man, I swear it's amusing
Honestly though, you must think that I'm stupid
Spent all my life just observing these humans
And watching their movements, I'm seeing right through it
You see what I'm doing, I'm bringing the heat
And I'm bringing the passion
I think I'm the shit, I can tell that that bothers you
Honestly, all that I needs a reaction
Back to the hustle
Rise to the top from the ash and the rubble
When they send shots, I don't have to rebuttal
I'm a hurricane homie, you a splash in the puddle
So what is the motive?
I just assume that you want me to notice
I just assume that you secretly love me and honestly
Probably don't want me to know it
Looking for that thing that gon' change my life
Looking for that thing that gon' change my life
Man that shit's so real, had to say that twice
Hands on the wheel, I'm a take my time
I'm just searching for something that's new to me
Truthfully, usually, naturally I would be doin' me
Lately it seems like I'm not what I used to be
I'm just ridin' round town, ridin' round town
Yeah, I said I'm ridin' round town
Looking for that brand new
Looking for that brand new
Yeah, I said I'm looking for that brand new
Ridin' round town, ridin' round town

Man that shit's so real, had to say that twice
Hands on the wheel, I'm a take my time
I'm just searching for something that's new to me
Truthfully, usually, naturally I would be doin' me
Lately it seems like I'm not what I used to be
I been searching for the truth, but I ain't find no answers
Questioning the facts, since back when I was in pampers
Looking for myself, trying to find me
Trying not to give a fuck about society's standards
Doing what I do, cause your boy got the flame
That gon' take him to the top like a Chinese lantern
Everybody really wanna have an opinion
Something that they never really had to begin with
So tuned in, but they don't do shit
If you say one thing, then they act so offended
Ya girl say she likes how I rap when I spit shit
Face got the beauty and the ass got the thickness
Spit something for her cause she look real good
And I'm trying to impress till I'm back to the business
If you in the crowd, hope you got your hands up
Look up in the mirror, I just got more handsome
When you in the whip, this an aux cord anthem
Played this for my dad and my pop's like, "Damn, son!"
If I want it, I'ma do it, to be honest with you homie
I ain't fucking with your music
You've been going through the motions
I've been running through the movements
I've got tunnel vision, honest, you don't want to get into it
They love the way I spit it, something like its mucus
Saying I'm the shit like I'm running through the sewage
I would do it all day if I could, but I can't
Cause I spend seven hours in a public institution
I'm talking all day, fella
This the type of shit that makes Kanye jealous
Its like an intervention going on the game
Cause I promise that it's nothing that y'all can't tell us
Looking for that thing that gon' change my life
Looking for that thing that gon' change my life
Man that shit's so real, had to say that twice
Hands on the wheel, I'm a take my time
I'm just searching for something that's new to me

Lately it seems like I'm not what I used to beTell them boys I'm on the way with it 
Ain't shit changed, but the goddamn slang
And the people tryna' hang with us
Y'all should know that I ain't playin' with it
Girl you know I get tired of the same ol' thing
So that's why I couldn't stay with it
I ain't mean to do you wrong though, hey
Know I beat it like a bongo, hey
So her best friend hates me now
But I ain't trippin off what y'all gon’ say
Tell them boys I'm on the way with it
Ain't shit changed, but the got damn slang
And the people tryna hang with us
Tell them boys I’m on the way with it
Something ‘bout the east end at night
Floatin’ through ya neighborhood below the streetlights
And I’m headed to ya culdesac
Told me park a couple houses down
Cuz your neighbors on surveillance
As a favor to ya parents while they out of town
I been tryna' catch a vibe from ya
That's exactly why I texted 'Hi' to ya
Wouldn't believe me if I told you that I’d never lie to ya
And you shouldn't really
I’d explain it, but you couldn't feel me
She said it wouldn't kill me just to have a real conversation one time in my life
I don't know what's wrong with me, girl I know you right
Staring at the ceiling while I listen to you talk about the things that i be thinkin’ bout too
And everything made sense for a second right then, but tomorrow I won't have a damn clue
Tell them boys I'm on the way with it 
Ain't shit changed, but the goddamn slang
And the people tryna' hang with us
Y'all should know that I ain't playin' with it
Girl you know I get tired of the same ol' thing

But I ain't trippin off what y'all gon’ say
Tell them boys I'm on the way with it
Ain't shit changed, but the got damn slang
And the people tryna hang with us
Tell them boys I’m on the way with it
Purple lights lighting up the basement
Lookin’ out the window when the sun down
Take it as a perfect indication that my brother might not ever have to work another day shift
Thinkin’ back when all of us in town
Remember we was always ridin’ around
Doing nothing, and that shit be so nostalgic to me now, like fuck
Ain't no option, man, I gotta make y'all proud
‘Cause the shit is in my blood, in my genes, you gon’ need some better denim
Local scene fucking with you 'til you doing better than 'em
They the type that's gon' pretend that something you said offend them
Just so they can have their boys hold ‘em back
Like, "Lemme hit ‘em"
What a stupid ass evening
But I could prolly use a ass beatin’
Help me write about something besides what I was doing last weekend
And the girls that I be fucking who be chewing Jack's semen
Tell them boys I'm on the way with it 
Ain't shit changed, but the goddamn slang
And the people tryna' hang with us
Y'all should know that I ain't playin' with it
Girl you know I get tired of the same ol' thing
So that's why I couldn't stay with it
I ain't mean to do you wrong though, hey

But I ain't trippin off what y'all gon’ say
Tell them boys I'm on the way with it
Ain't shit changed, but the got damn slang
And the people tryna hang with us
Tell them boys I’m on the way with itYessir
Turned ya to my nemesis
Dimes I got ten assists
When you get to flossin', know they tend to trip
Last year I lost what I had left of my innocence
I could have a good girl, but I like em messy like my penmanship
Hold up think I did some shit
No I’m not a killer but i might just have to hit the switch
Can we put our differences aside baby bust it open for me can you hit the splits
I get so impatient cause I know that we got hits to get
Trust me I got lines and I got hooks just like I went to fish
I don’t make it intricate on purpose I’m just ill with this
Tell me can you deal with this
It ain’t cause I’m cute she just ain’t met nobody real as this
I might hit the dealership and cop me something I can slide down Bardstown with
You fuckin' with the fountain
If I keep it a thousand I'll probably need some counseling
My pops is 'bout as ready as my accountant
What'd I do without him
I can’t trust a soul
When i come to town she give something I can drown in
I remember back when y’all was doubting
Now you get to know what self doubt is, self doubt is
Your girl in the crowd and she screaming the loudest
We know you ain’t bout it
You say it but we doubt it
Bitch I’m from the 'Ville not the Appalachian Mountains
I just activated now it's, over for you pussies doin' all that bad mouthin'
I was all you had, well, I guess you're ass out, then we heard your last album
That shit was ass how did you think that it would work
I don’t bad but my knee wanted a purse
First i hit it then i pass it like i’m speaking in a church
Wonder where she got that semen on her shirt from
Ladies i encourage y’all to twerk some
Talk about a goat yeah my momma know she birthed one
Just incase you looking for somebody to get dirt from
I recommend you reach out to the girls in the city i ain’t heard from
They will be the first ones to tell you i ain’t worth none
Got a super soaker yeah she hit me with a squirt gun
She’s an 80s baby i like someone i can learn from 
Uh the type of shit they’ve been waiting on
All she play inside the whip is latin trap and reggaeton
I was off something had me sweating till the break of dawn
No pants hair tide
Go ahead and take that thong off girl don’t take it wrong
Hard to focus when you tryna keep a train of thought
Asian girlfriend pops look just like Genghis Khan
He told her if she mess with me i’m bringing shame upon her family
No you can’t stand me
Kush in the pantry
Jar full of plan bs
Shorty out of texas got cheeks like sandy
K y engineer put me in the game i was sleeping on the couch in the studio at
Chamblee
Took me in as family
Me ain’t two four bas got plus and
Me and two four
Me and two four bass got plus andy
Call her bluetooth she know how to do it hands free
You don’t fuck with me well that find and dandy
Find and dandy that’s find and dandy
You don’t fuck with me well that’s fine and dandyYuh
I am no hero, I just write verses
I tip my hat to the doctors and the nurses
Nilan bring the Styrofoam, carry out into my home
Before I touch the box, I gotta disinfect the surface
My career would be screwed without the internet for certain
So I would assume if this had happened back in ‘85
Artists probably woulda had to get some separate work in
Even now, off the road, missin’ checks is hurtin’
She gettin’ freaky on the FaceTime for me
'Cause it might just be a while before we gettin’ sex in person
Just a month ago, shit was picturesque and perfect
Wish that I could say that things were gettin less concernin’
But instead, I’m having dark thoughts late at night
Triggering me to text my parents beggin' them to stay inside
Bad news stacking up, looking for a ray of shine
Something we could turn to, someone that’ll say it’s fine
Cause the dead thing just taking lives, and it wants to takes it time No amount of money or celebrity can change its mind
Life’s coming to a halt, they all mean the same as mine
It’s fucked upI been gifted from the start to the finish
But as I've gotten older it's been harder to listen
Middle school is when I started resistin
My teachers' told my parents
Yeah as smart as this kid is, his heart isn't in it
Now they got me arguin with them
Cause Mom and Dad never thought I'd start a new mission
Had it all planned out like I be part of the system
Now I'm shaking things up like the Parkinsons syndrome
I wasn't made for that 9 to 5
I am not the same as you
I can see a difference between everything you say and do
I can tell you need somebody round
That's gonna state the truth
So basically I'm saying
You just talking while we making moves
And this is just the start of my life
I done came a long way from that Guitar Hero mic
And writing raps with Copeland
We recorded in the basement
Might've thought is was a phase
This is more than dedication
I never woulda known
I never woulda known
I be flipping switches got these bitches
That be fiendin' for a playa
Man they beggin for the bone
And my phone is always jumpin
Man they tryin to get a hold of me
But ain't nobody home
Cause they picked a mothafucka man
They picked a mothafucka
Like it's eeny miny moe
God damn God damn
No I never woulda known
I been peeping what these people been saying
They being outrageous
I see they need a reason to hate it
Can't even debate it
They come in and they leave in amazement
Cause bitch I'm me
And my homies put your team in the pavement
She say you different yeah I know it
It don't need no explaining
I got music inside my mind
I know they eagerly waiting for me to create it
It's guaranteed to be on they playlist
I tell my teachers' bout my dreams
And they gon think that I'm playing, but nah
I'm really going for this shit
My parents talking College
I ain't going to that shit
I got people that's around me
And they know I'm bout to win
Don't expect me to respect you
We don't know about you kid
We don't know about you
You fiendin' for attention
And searching for a chance just a reason to get mentioned
And we got the whole neighborhood terrified
Before you ask me for a favor tell that  mine
I never woulda known
I never woulda known
I be flipping switches got these bitches
That be fiendin' for a playa
Man they beggin for the bone
And my phone is always jumpin
Man they tryin to get a hold of me
But ain't nobody home
Cause they picked a mothafucka man
They picked a mothafucka
Like it's eeny miny moe
God damn God damn
No I never woulda knownI gotta be honest
I didn't want to do it to him like this
Ain't nobody fucking with a kid from Louisville 
My fucking trampers in a cast, no movie deal 
Shit kill with the bars, man, I'm truly ill
Spray tan, fade, nails look the booty real
I can guarantee 'cause she's in the tenth grade 
But them yoga pants got her lookin' like Kim K. 
I'm tryna focus but I can't do it
And when I came home, I'ma masturbate to it 
If we're being honest, can nobody stop me 
Think it's  about the 'Ville since Muhammad Ali 
All you really gotta do is drop a hot beat 
Critics say that I'm the next Mahatma Gandhi 
You got that right, I mean I'm not that nice
But I throw the peace sign 'cause I'm ain't 'bout that life
I ain't never so cold 'cause I got that Sprite
I ain't never been to , but I could rock that mic
Cut my hair for my mom, so I bun 'em, steal my dead skin 
And worry and then I don't go bald like my dad did
When I can't tell, the first thing I'm buyin' is
A case full of Bosley and I'ma start applying it 
'Cause I don't care if it's hereditary
Only thing I'm worrying 'bout is making sure my head is hairy
Jewfro, yet they call me pube-head
But I ain't worried 'bout it 'cause I know I'm too fresh
That's the truth like Paul Pierce
Spent the last three years waitin' for the all-clear
Tim Ford yelling, "Don't believe what I got in store"
Fast break, 'bout to wipe you up at down the gym floor
Grab a pitchfork, tell me where the village is
I'm about to pillage it, damn, I'm feelin' villainous
Killin' it, who would , diligent, plus I'm 
Doin' it for the thrill of it, flickerin' like a filament 
Y'all gon' have to wait 'til it hits the fan
Spend my whole spring break scrollin' down Instagram
Double-tap her pictures of these girls in her bikinis
I'm jealous, but I know the whole world is gonna see me one day 
 self for all these shortcomings
And the fact that I get worried is who makes me more funny
'Cause I know it's bound to work out soon 
Finally made this song you can work out to
 be get you goin',  you already know I'm rollin'
Motorboating through the competition without no opponents
Hold the phone, they say they call 
And no, we don't, I know we're dying
 drawin', I'm just waitin' on that Kodak only 
'Cause I know it's coming for me
Drop a hunnid on me
Funny story, I don't love the money, I just want the glory 
And I promise that I'm really worth it
Funny how I'm murdering these pussies, yet I'm still a virgin 
That's the true virgin! 
But I'm murdering and still a virgin!
I said I'm still a virgin!Yo, yo
Okay, okay, okay
Man, I got songs to write, homework due
10 P.M. and I'm overdue
Sunday night, hit the sack
Wake up next day go to school
Life sucks, but not really though
Currently, man, I'm  flow
Heard of me, man, I'm ill and dope
Murder beats then I kill the flow
And I'm doin' me, son, you ain't comin' close
Take you outta your comfort zone
Bust a flow and I run the show
'Bout to cut you short like summer clothes
I go in on my B-Day
Go out for that cheesecake
Stay up late with a plate of cake
And a young boy still tryna make that bank
They say it's toward my college fund
I just hope that college fun
All they throw is hunnids 'cause they glad that I'm their daughter's son
Ridin' round now I'm well behaved
Working hard 'til my wealth is safe
Mess with me and you melt away, man, name a rapper do well as me
I'm straight to the point Tim Hardaway
Got 'em jelly, like marmalade
I'ma go hard 'til the bar is raised
She got me sprung like March to May
It's Harlow, man, I'm too raw
Spit foul, no loose ball
Got 'em sayin', "Dang", 'cause I'm ballin' like 
Ceiling on that roof attached, I'm movin' back, you dudes is wackPat White
I used to know that I could rap, now I know I'm a prodigy
Lately I’ve been feeling, emotionless honestly
So I'm thinkin' with my head, ’cause I know where I gotta be
When I put my mind to it, man, no one is stoppin' me, but
I don't wanna talk about my aspirations
'Cause sometimes, I be havin' trouble havin' patience
I'm an aggravatin', masturbatin’, rap sensation with the swagger of a premature ejaculation
Uncontrollable, and I don’t know when to stop
As long as the beat's playin’, man, the flow doesn't stop
When I roll down the block, all the bros wanna talk
And tell me, how they're tryin' not get exposed by the cops
"I’m really getting sick of this place"
"I gotta blow up on that dro to help me get through the day"
"I can't trust the government because the system is fake"
"And if I have to break the law, well that's a risk Imma take"
Chillin' with the bros, I think we're 'bout to go somewhere but really I don't know
We're all about as flexible as acrobats, and I'm just waitin' on this girl to Snapchat me back
We're kinda friends, but at the same time we're not
'Cause I'm pretty sure she knows that I think she's hot
I try not to make it awkward at all, but, you know?
Just forget it, let's get on with the song
I'm a sneaky young fella, but they never notice
Stealing Wi-Fi if that network open
I be Edgar Poe'n, with them clever poems
She said my pale skin make me look like Edward Cullen
It's like Guinness when you talkin', record broken
They try to understand, but won't ever know it
Chillin' with the bros, I think we're 'bout to go somewhere but really I don't know
We're all about as flexible as acrobats, and I'm just waitin' on this girl to Snapchat me back
We're kinda friends, but at the same time we're not
'Cause I'm pretty sure she knows that I think she's hot
I try not to make it awkward at all, but, you know?
Just forget it, let's get on with the songYeah
This is gon' be the hottest summer in history
Life as we knew it before, this is only memories
Chief of the country ain't showin' us any empathy, nah
This is Chuck D, Public Enemy
This is not a fundraiser, this is real energy
This is not a token friendship, he is kin to me
Don't know how the fuck you think that this how it's meant to be
Pick a side, less tweets, more picket signs
Spent the last two months bein' told to get inside
Now we all outside 'cause we sick and tired
2020 and it's supposed to be a different time
But racism is alive, though they think it's behind us
Rest in peace to Breonna
We ain't askin' for the moon, just police to be honest
I don't think it's too much
These times got me thinkin' too much
Or maybe just enough
Maybe just enough
Maybe this is what it takes
Maybe this is how the levee breaks 
Maybe this is fake 
Maybe this the only way When this beat came on the speakers, man, I knew it was the one
No agenda for tonight, man, we just doin' what we want
If I gotta pick and choose, then I would choose to have some fun
Ain't no drinkin' in the whip, but we still cruisin' like the rum
When this beat came on the speakers, man, I knew it was the one
No agenda for tonight, man, we just doin' what we want
If I gotta pick and choose, then I would choose to have some fun
Ain't no drinkin' in the whip, but we still cruisin' like the rum
Rollin' 'round town in the passenger seat 
My boy got the whip, as we pass through the streets 
Slumped to the seat while I bump to the beat
While my dad's on the phone tryna ask where I be 
But, I ain't feel the phone vibrate in my cargoes
You know what it is, man, you know it's young Harlow 
See a fine chick, and I'm peepin' that shit
'Cause you know the boy gotta check her out like a barcode 
Woah, in the zone, man, I gotta get home
Curfew twelve-thirty and it's twelve-fifteen 
Drive by slow, and I'm high off life
So my eyes hang low like my self-esteem 
Nah, just playin' I'm the man right now
Man, I swear to God, life ain't never felt this sweet 
Haven't felt this free since elementary
And tonight is a night that I'm relishing
I am just trying to get through the obstacles
Hoping tonight doesn't end in the hospital
Working things out like that shit was abdominals
Then I just cruise, Mission Impossible
Like a white vacation
Man, I swear sometimes life's amazing
Sit back in the nighttime, at the right time
And you know the young boy mind is racing 
White suburbs to th
Top to the bottom, first to the last levels
To the last lights in the dead night, like, woah now
Slow down, put his foot on the gas pedal 
Got that hype and I got that metal
Got that bass and I got that treble
Time stays tickin' on this life I'm livin'
So goin' back home ain't on my schedule
When this beat came on the speakers, man, I knew it was the one
No agenda for tonight, man, we just doin' what we want
If I gotta pick and choose, then I would choose to have some fun 
Ain't no drinkin' in the whip, but we still cruisin' like the rum 
Oh shit, I just turned eighteen
No curfew now, gotta work that thing
When this beat came on the speakers, man, I knew it was the one
No agenda for tonight, man, we just doin' what we want
If I gotta pick and choose, then I would choose to have some fun
Ain't no drinkin' in the whip, but we still cruisin' like the rum
When this beat came on the speakers, man, I knew it was the one
No agenda for tonight, man, we just doin' what we want
If I gotta pick and choose, then I would choose to have some fun
Ain't no drinkin' in the whip, but we still cruisin' like the rum, yeahToo clean cut, runnin’ out the crib, she don’t do things much
She taste like Starbursts, the pink one
I’m fly, you a penguin
Lotta girls at the party, I ain’t bring one
But I came with a couple delinquents 
It’s that season, I ain’t seen thatI don't need a damn degree to go and land in a cubicle
Imma kill the fuckin' game, I've been plannin' the funeral, yeah
I'm fuckin' nasty and I know it
She said I'm immature, but I'm actually a poet
And girl, don't worry, I'm a feminist, too
So you should take a load off, while you wrapped in that clothingLickwood means "rewind" and gunshot means "forward"
You requested it, so we rewind
Yeah, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way up, way up
I got enemies, got a couple enemies
Got a couple people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take away from a fella
But I think you are way to fuckin' jealous
Stirrin' up the pot, now I'm praying that these bitches got a problem with me
They talk a lot of envy, no that shit does not offend me
Stop pretending, I can like you being honest with me
Tellin' me what I should change, you just out here droppin' pennies
And I don't need your two cents, uh
High stakes on me like the top floor, Ruth's Chris, ruthless
I might just leave the booth lit
I can feel the irritation, call that shit a new sense
I got girls in real life that say I'm doin' too much
That I'm annoying and they hate me and my music, it sucks
I know people online that say ya boy is a lame
But when I see 'em in the halls, they avoidin' my gaze
It's kinda funny to me, I mean like, honestly though
You talk a lot about your music when you droppin' that, though
Ain't got time for the wannabes, I don't care for these rookies
I know you're mad, 'cause your girl is out here wearin' my hoodie
"I fuckin' hate Jack Harlow, I swear he's a bitch"
"Dude thinks he can rap, I heard his parents are rich"
"What an asshole, honestly I hope that he dies"
"No, I've never met him, but I know what he's like"
H-A to the R, to the L-O-W, uh
Aimin' for the stars, and my fellas comin' through 
Really, it ain't nothing, we just take it how we get it
'Cause your boy just got his license, now he makin' bad decisions, uh
You've got a problem we can work it out
You should take a chance to listen to me 'til you've heard me out
I don't care about why you hate, or what the hell you heard about
Only thing I wanna know is what you're insecure about
I got enemies, got a couple enemies
Got a couple people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take away from a fella
But I think you are way to fuckin' jealous, uh
I got enemies, got a couple enemies
Got a couple people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take away from a fella
But I think you are way to fuckin' jealous, uhYeah 
Ever since sixth grade, all the other kids say
That I'm such a bitch-made, wannabe, renaissance man 
But my shit bangs, all I do is spit flames on 'em
Like get it, hot damn, yo, that kid is not playin' 
I dream about a place where the lights dim down 
And when they all treat me like a white Chris Brown 
They wasn't big on me, but I might fit now 
I grew up just a little and they like my style 
But I think that that's a ways away
It's gonna be a little while 'fore I make it rain
I came to play, but I'm still all business
And I ain't tryna slow down and wait until y'all get it 
I'm on my grizz like Tony Allen
And I'm the shizz from Sactown to Coney Island
Make 'em open eyelids, 'cause they know I'm wildin'
And even when it gets tense, I ain't showin' violence
Tell me why this life's so swell
And this beat's got the vibe of a nice hotel 
I'm in a lobby sippin' hot chocolate
People watchin' while I'm sittin' there just not talkin'
It's November in Michigan and this family vacation feels more like imprisonment
But I know it's all gonna be nostalgia soon
And when I look back, I can say I called it, too
We're usually at the Marriott, but this is just a little better 
Makes me want to find a fireplace and a Christmas sweater 
So cozy that I'm yellin', "F a water park!" 
I'm not the type to play, unless I got the part
LOL, that's a joke I came up with
Shouts out to the bros I came up with 
Imaginary friends like bros I came up with
If you ever meet me, man, you know I can't function 
And I ain't blowin' that substance 
Sweet not sour, though you know it stays puffin'
Memories with all the homies that I've ate lunch with
Chicken nuggets on my tray, I know I've ate hundreds 
I wanna live the eight hundred
Infatuated with the woman I can make love with
If you ain't with it, please don't say nothin' 
You can dislike it, but you know you can't touch this
Tell me why this life's so swell
And this beat's got the vibe of a nice hotel
I'm in a lobby sippin' hot chocolate
People watchin' while I'm sittin' there just not talkin'
It's November in Michigan and this family vacation feels more like imprisonment
But I know it's all gonna be nostalgia soon
And when I look back, I can say I called it, too
Really wishin' that this town was larger 
I'm feelin' 'bout as independent as the Founding Fathers 
But my father tryna find his son
'Cause my phones dead and I still haven't found my charger 
Couple dollars, and plenty of change
I'ma walk down the hall to the vending machine
And eat enough fat food to put me into my grave 
My cash runnin' low, like the end of my name 
But I ain't even stoppin' there
In the mood for some Rally's, so I ask the concierge 
If he knows where one's at or if they've even got it here
He said, "There's a couple in town, but really, not one near
But there's a Long John Silver's down the block
About five minutes away, if you wanna make the walk"
Oh really? Thanks a lot, asshole 
Tell me why this life's so swell

The fellas you be with they got you huffing the exhaust
Wondering how we do man it's something in the I've been obsessed with your face
Thinking 'bout you and a dress and a date
Let me get some cash with this check at the bank
And we can make the best of the rest of the day
I like it when it's sunny outside and I pull up at your crib 'round twenty past five
And I'm staring at your walk when you coming outside
Ain't seen you in a minute, girl, it's fucking 'bout time that we get it
Tank top with the skin showin'
Light brown with the skin tone
Dime piece with the white teeth
She got her hair down like the windows
And you know that you're beautiful
The type of girl that got me really hoping I'm suitable
You been doing you and I don't really know what to do with you in the moment
So I'm driving a little slower than usual
I can tell you not a fuckin' dummy
When I'm with you I might try a little harder to be funny
For the time being I'll assume you honestly just want me
But these women gon' change when you got a bunch of money
So, I savor these moments
I'll take your ass shopping and pay for the clothing
Honestly what you do is magical to me
And really I just want a taste of the potion
Everything from your smile to your hair and your eyes
From your step to your dress and I'm set
Everything from your smile to your hair and your eyes
From your step to your dress and I'm set
I've been obsessed with ya sex
Move so good, you should move to success
I can see you stripping naked, make the money stretch
Said she do it in the motel for the kid
Take you to a city, to a place you never been
God damn, dressing like 
You next to me looking like Yoko
Fuck TV, you workin' with an Apple
Let me control that fatty like Roku
We can bounce to the mall with your homegirls
Or we can bounce in the mall like pogo
Keep our vibes on the low like no-shows
In 2000 you probably wore Manolos
I can tell 'cause you living up in Soho
But you ghetto 'cause your ass like 
Kardashian, no promo
We never watching, we be busy with our photos
Front cam with the fam, all gang signs in it
You laugh cause' you glad 'cause the gangs all in it
Never feel safer, guns on the table
My brother gon' keep us, the Canon is aimin'
Right back to the room, nip slip, badaboom
Light that Marley, sniff that Heidy Klum
Invite only, sip that billion
Everything from your smile to your hair and your eyes
From your step to your dress and I'm set
Everything from your smile to your hair and your eyes
From your step to your dress and I'm setI-I-I kick a bitch to the curb, no question
Fell asleep in the West End
I got friends on the East and West and
First class for the first time, I’m flexin’
It’s a  red eye flight, no connection
Bad bitches, champagne bottles in my section 
A-a-all types of complexions
I remember back when she ain’t show me no affection
I remember back when I couldn’t get a call back 
Okay cool I’ma fall back
Ronnie used to whip it to the Red Roof 
Doin’ shows 
Lotta girlfriends I done lost track
Might be time to make a couple cuts ‘cause I swear they got me off track
Yeah, they got me makin’ soft tracks
I’m ‘bouta go and get my sauce back
Don’t act so sus
Hottest of the city and I just 
 rough sex then you know
I kick a bitch to the curb, no question
Fell asleep in the West End
I got friends on the East and West and
First class for the first time, I’m flexin’
It’s a  red eye flight, no connection
Bad bitches, champagne bottles in my section 
A-a-all types of complexions
I remember back when she ain’t show me no affection
Oh yeah I’m missing days
I can feel thangs as they shift and change
Tryna reconnect but it seems I’m in a different place
It’s a distance thang
I got a side chick at home, I gotta distant name
 Shit’s insane,  get this way
Waking up to Sunday
I brought her up to the 
I can tell she gon be uptight, just right 
I kick a bitch to the curb, no question

And all the girls gone 'cus college in session
And I been messin' with them dropout chicks
But I'm tryin' to wife a oncologist, ay
Solipsism when I ride to the rhythm
Demons in my head and they try and come and get him
I got dirt on my denims, I got dirt that I've done
I got girls I deceived with the words that they want
Leave your purse in the trunk 'cus when it get's late
Man these parking lots tend to get dark a lot
And my necklace is the X that marks the spot
So I might tuck it just to make it more hard to spot
One day I prolly wish that I could tuck myself too
Same day I'll prolly have the chicks I touched myself to
'Cus the ones that used to treat me like I wasn't well groomed or some'
Fuck with me now, I just got smacked in the city, come get me down
Insides burning but we still chug Henny down
I'm bricked up with my chick 'cus, hear me out
Know me too well, she ain't got trust in me now, trust in me now
I'm in the metropolitan, it's lookin' like fall again
And all the girls gone 'cus college in session
And I been messin' with them dropout chicks
But I'm tryin' to wife a oncologist
Me and her got a unspoken understanding that
When she pull up on me, this is all this is
And there's another girl that I feel obligated to
'Cus she told me that she gon' jump off a bridge
I don't want to see no wedding pics comin' off the fridge
I was aimin' for the life I wanted, am I off a smidge?
Crazy how your dick'll have you movin' with no cautionness
It's fucked up, I know everything, I got  quick
Am I unrealistic for thinkin' I could have what my mom and my pops got
The fellas used to tell me that I'm not hot
But they fuck with me now, I just got smacked in the city, come get me down
Insides burning but we still chug Henny down
I'm bricked up with my chick 'cus, hear me out
Know me too well, she ain't got trust in me now, trust in me now
I'm in the metropolitan, it's lookin' like fall again
And all the girls gone 'cus college in session
And I been messin' with them dropout chicks
But I'm tryin' to wife a oncologist, ayI wanna get into a fight
She wanna ride in a stick shift
Top down, what’s your vibe in a stick shift?
This my first time driving a stick shift
Diamonds looking like the side of a big ship
You ain’t gotta be so shy tonight
I think I might get high tonightI know we got one
Bitch you should know what I mean by “I’m done”
I’m on my grind so I can’t stay, uh
Pretty girl from the same state
Big dreams but she stuck in the same place
Fuck what ya manz say
I know that he cheated
Well fuck that’s a damn shame
I done run that out, are you down?
We can campaign
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?Lyrics for this song have not yet been transcribedI just wanna feel alive
Maybe I should start smoking?
Maybe I should tell her how I feel
Maybe I should go and get my heart broken
Maybe I should take a long walk
Maybe I should put my got damn phone down
Maybe I should do a lil more
Maybe I should stop by my grandmas house
I was thinkin ‘bout a sunny day
I was wondering how to make my dad proud of the son he raised
I was wondering how these kids get hooked on these one-a-days
Funny thing, I be lookin’ at em in a judgey way
Truth is, I ain’t never felt like I should run a way
I ain't never had to live a life that I fuckin’ hate
I know people livin’ with a never ending stomach ache
But I been wondering if I'm really happy
I ain't sad, I'm just wondering if I'm really happy
I been wondering if this shit that I been chasin’
Gon’ be gratifying for me when it really happens
I should be feelin’ blessed to just be breathin’
Lately I can’t seem to fight the stress and all the demons
Lately I just seem to treat the sex like an achievement
Goin’ deeper with no depth and all I left ‘em with is some semen
I hope that shit was worth it
Look at the mistakes that made me grow into this person
I been seeing all the flaws ‘fore I notice when it’s perfect
I just wanna feel alive
Maybe I should start smoking?
Maybe I should tell her how I feel
Maybe I should go and get my heart broken
Maybe I should take a long walk
Maybe I should put my got damn phone down
Maybe I should do a lil more
Maybe I should stop by my grandmas house
I was thinkin ‘bout a sunny day
I was wondering how to make my dad proud of the son he raised
I was wondering how these kids get hooked on these one-a-days
Funny thing, I be lookin’ at em in a judgey way
Truth is, I ain’t never felt like I should run a way
I ain't never had to live a life that I fuckin’ hate
I know people livin’ with a never ending stomach ache
All that you been bringin’ me is self doubt
I feel like they leechin’ all my health now
Ain't nobody thinkin’ for themselves now
All they worried ‘bout is if they need you
Can you help now?
No
All this shit gon’ bring me to a meltdown
Woah
I done spent some weeks in the dark
Only listening to beats in a seat tryna start
On these words and accelerate the beat from my heart
Searchin for that high again
And I want that shit to last me more than
5 or 10 minutes at a time, take control of my environment
Choosin’ how my time is spent, gotta let you know that
Anybody with me in the middle of the night is liable to become my psychiatrist
Ain't it funny how that goes
Everything been good, I just wanted you to know
I been growin’ up
I just wanna feel alive
Maybe I should start smoking?
Maybe I should tell her how I feel
Maybe I should go and get my heart broken
Maybe I should take a long walk
Maybe I should put my got damn phone down
Maybe I should do a lil more
Maybe I should stop by my grandmas house
I was thinkin ‘bout a sunny day
I was wondering how to make my dad proud of the son he raised
I was wondering how these kids get hooked on these one-a-days
Funny thing, I be lookin’ at em in a judgey way
Truth is, I ain’t never felt like I should run a way
I ain't never had to live a life that I fuckin’ hate
