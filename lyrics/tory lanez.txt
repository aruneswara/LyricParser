As it's unfolding it's like—Fuck Tory Lanez, okay? Now, I’m from Houston, and he's from, bro
And to think that the whole night unfolded on social media
You are the alleged shooter of Megan Thee Stallion
Instagram, in the pool with Kylie Jenner
Was she backtracking with what she said originally?
You know, maybe that's why we don't have a report
Donkey of the day
Some bitches tryna  take up for Tory and, "It's more to the story," bitch, it ain't-there ain't nothing to the story
Tory Lanez got a lot of bad press
Serious, he's gon’ get deported
Donkey of the day for Friday August 21st goes to Daystar Peterson
So they got pulled over and she had been shot already, great
Well, hold up—
Donkey of the Day
What I’m looking like, he looking at the police and then shot her?
Niggas like that, you a sucker, he's the king sucker, he’s the-he's the biggest sucker in the industry 
We gotta talk about Tory Lanez and Megan Thee Stallion
Kaash is looking for you, dawg
Because the police came out saying, "We didn't even know she was shot"
Guess who I believe? Megan
The best thing for Tory Lanez is for real, he needs to just begone
I'm done with this, you gotta know the truth
Ayy, they rather see me in the cell
Like how he posted out with thirty thousand dollar bail?
I’m the GOAT, y'all niggas know I made that dope float on the scale
I had them hoes goin' crazy, fiends crackin', goin' pale
They know I'm real, I got that flow, it's on sale if you need a rush
Coke blowin' out my fiend's nose like the speaker bus
Ho caught me D'd up, talk down, we T'ing up
Megan people tryna frame me for a shootin'
But them boys ain't clean enough
I see how they teamin' up, watchin' and I'm calculatin'
Gotta keep it quiet, I can't jeopardize the outcome waitin'
Seein' certain niggas hatin', like, how this nigga hatin'?
I done gave these people so much features, made these niggas famous
They was on the blog sayin' I'm canceled from this entertainment
I was on that Spotify like thirty million monthly listeners, I'm fuckin' goin' crazy
And my fans support me brazy, everythin' I do is for you, I promise I'll be on it daily
I got nothin' but love to spread, but niggas hate me
Hurt my heart to see them Twitter fingers come from Kehlani's and Kaash Paige's
But I flipped the switch, I'm grippin' money at that fast pace
And don't ask me for shit when it get real, that's my last favor
Can't cry now 'cause I'ma laugh later
Girl, you had the nerve to write that statement on that affidavit
Knowin' I ain't do it but I'm comin' at my truest
Tryna keep this shit two hunnid with you, shorty, I can prove it
But them people in yo ear, they the true ones that I fear
They really got you thinkin' Tory Lanez would do you in, for real
Don't forget you was my bitch, I held it down and kept it real
I would never paint no fake picture of you just for some mills
And I thought that you was solid too, but look at how you doin' me
Look at how you doin' me, people tryna ruin me
And what's even worse is I'm still thinkin' about you and me
How you goin' live my birthday with all your jewelry to try to make some fool of me?
But I love you hard so I'm gon' cool it, B
'Cause I was coolin' right with Cuban, B, that was a stupid me
Somehow I'm still down to renegotiate the unity
My heart in some foolery, this shit is just confusin' me
I'm goin' through these phases, but I gotta stack that paper
And the real estate niggas hatin', took me off that application
But when they took that from me, they really took that from my baby
What the fuck I'm finna say to his old lady?
What the fuck y'all mean, my son don't need a house?
My baby momma don't need safety?
And even though I got the payment, the real estate niggas still hatin'
'Cause he watchin' me all on the news, but I ain't charged with no cases
Say the owner say my case is lookin' crazy, how the fuck that even make sense?
New times turn to past tense
All I want is straight cash, niggas say I lack sense
Star player, hearin' lies comin' from the back bench
Kill or be killed, that's the reason I don't have friends
Niggas lyin' on the crodie, niggas sayin' I'm deported
Oh, now I'm 5'3"? Niggas sayin' I'm a shorty
But lil' bitch I'm 5'7", money on me side-steppin'
And if I stand on my wallet, you can see my thighs in Heaven
One Umbrella gang and when we come back, don't you try reppin'
'Fore I let these niggas breathe, I gotta teach a couple lessons
Gotta see a couple questions: how the fuck you get shot in your foot, don't hit no bones or tendons?
How the fuck your team is tryna to paint me as some whole menace?
I just lost like ten million dollars because this cold business
But I got like ten million followers that's gon' roll with me
Fans that support me 'cause they know my heart
So I don't give a damn if shorty know Jigga
I was taught to beat the block
Eeny, meeny, miney in these streets, and so my Nina cocked
Niggas, y'all can play me, y'all can frame me, but I'ma reach the top
I would never put you in no danger, and if I did, you would've said it when you seen the cops
Ayy, Lamborghini bands and they comin' out the floor
Fff, hit the fan when I'm pullin' out the dough-oh
I would never fall out with niggas over hoes, ayy
Money over fall outs, my nigga, that's the code-oh
Santorini bands when I pull up to the coast
Better have my bands when I pull up to the door-oh
Niggas can't believe I done pulled up in a Ghost
And I don't ever wanna fuck with y'all no more, G

There's 24 hours in a day
I think about you more than 24 times
Just tryna not think about you

'Cause you always end up by my side
Through loving you, I needed time

You, woahYeah, ain't no one colder than me 
I'm straight from the mud, I got me a plug
And now I be rollin' with Meech 
You think you the shit? I think you a bitch
Now go 'head and call the police 
These niggas a trip, your homie's a snitch
He'll probably be home in a week 
I hit up Tory and told him, "I know you don't like me but fuck it I'm over the beef" 
Told 'em we could be friends, invited him over and gave him some soda and bleach 
They said, "Joyner you lost it"
I told them they soft
Now go take a stroll on the beach 
Nigga, I get the sauce, bitch, I'm a dog
Just don't get a hold of my leash 
Y'all niggas back to the bluffin' 
Joyner get back to the bustin' 
If I do not make a few million this year then I might just go back to the hustlin'
I got me some product and I ain't gon' hide it
I might just start trappin' in public
I might go to prison and free all my niggas
That's word to Harriet Tubman
Tired of you askin' me questions, I'm sick of it 
"Why you keep shuttin' shit down on the internet? 
Why do you have so much talent and benefits?
Why you keep droppin' your album in increments?"
A.D.H.D. is a social experiment
Who pay attention the most when they hearin' it?
You cannot stop it, there's no interferin' it
This is my moment and no one is sharin' it
Nigga, I'm just gettin' started, I hit all my targets
I promise I'm very defiant 
If I do not win the Grammy this year then I'll blow that bitch up and then everyone dyin' 
I think all my shit is hot, if everyone think that it's not then everyone lyin'
I hope my shit doesn't flop, 'cause I'll put a gun to your head and make everyone buy it
I'm diggin' the hole you get buried inside , or you get buried in silence
The day that I die I get buried in diamonds
I'm killin' you niggas, you barely survivin' 
I think I'm so high, I could marry a pilot
I'm Area 51 alien, I let my UFO fly in, it's scary and violent
I shut down the planet, you hearin' the sirens 
I'm very excited and you shouldn't bother 
Joyner got too many problems 
I told that little bitch that I'm down with a threesome as long as it's you and your mama 
I ain't got no patience, I love to get dirty
But fuck it I'm cool with the drama 
When niggas be hatin', I tell them, "No worries my nigga, Hakuna Matata"
I don't wear Prada, just bring me a white tee 
I bust some Margiela's, I still wear the Nikes 
I roll with some hitters, I know you don't like me
I shit on you niggas, now bring me some wipeys 
You think I'm a killer? Well maybe I might be
I ain't got no feelings I dare you to fight me 
I'll swing with a left but I'm really a righty
Get pussy and money, it barely excites me
I'm ready, don't try me, so bow
Fuck all you pricks
You cannot harm me, I think you a bitch
You think I'm corny? I think I'm the shit
When she get horny, she tickle my dick
When I was broke, I would think like I'm rich
'Til I fucked up my credit and hit me a lick 
Then I got me some money to get me a crib
And then blew it on bitches from Plenty of Fish 
I'm goin' back to the streets 
If Freddy and Jason had babies, my nigga I promise then that would be me 
Niggas all in my honey and actin' all funny, I think I'm attracted to bees
They told me that I changed, I looked in the mirror like what the fuck happened to me?
Ever since I done came up, these niggas been so in their feelings
They countin' my pockets I know that it's killin' 'em
Don't tell me you proud when you know that you jealous
The money keep pilin' I know that you smell it
You think you entitled? Well suck on a dick and I hope that you swallow
And that's how I'm feelin', put that on the Bible
Don't call me your family, you know you're my rival I do what I gotta
Now turn the fuckin' TV up, I'm in the media
And ain't nobody wanna see me up, a nigga heating up
I'm like a sickle cell anemia, I really mean it
But I'm 'bout to slow a nigga breathin' up, I think he's seen enough 
I go to hell, I fuck a demon up, I think I'm mean enough
To beat a nigga with Adidas 'til I fuck the sneakers up 
I'll sucker-punch you when I'm sneakin' up
You couldn't see me but I had to hit 'em like a meteor 
And make 'em giddy up, to get the trunk
And I went from nothing to somethin'
I fell in love with the guns and I got a hundred and one 
And like every day that I'm bustin' I'm putting one in your stomach
I got 'em jumping and running, you better cover and duck 
And I'm not the one to be fucked with
I'm not the one that you think you could do whatever you want to 
There's gonna be repercussions
The enemies know what's up and I'm up at three in the mornin'
When you be sleepin' and yawnin', you know the evil be callin' 
Somebody better call the ambulance or the E-M-T 
Nigga, I'm the bomb like T-N-T
Bet I roll up on a nigga with a G-M-C 
Get to clappin' on 'em, end of it, the E-N-D
Call the plug, tell him that I want at least ten keys
Now I'm back in business, E-P-M-D 
Couldn't walk in my shoes with a street stampede
Can't walk this way, I Run D-M-C 
Pack in the mail, I sit it down and it's crackin' the scale
Had to switch position from the kitchen, nigga, I was flippin' like a spatula there
Pretty Ricky with them bitches, when I'm hittin' long as a dread on spectacular hair
Here shit, light shit, white whip, open up it look like a packet of mayo
I'm back in Rodeo, fuckin' up the check and chuckin' up the set
And I'm back off the layover, pay-over way over niggas
No slumber but a nigga stay over, nigga
Your bitch is with me 'til the day-day, AK loaded up the same way
Chain swang, white person screamin' out, "Gang gang!"
Slide or kick, Jet Li or Liu K-K-Kang 
I got a Little B, he call me based God like brring, ding, ding
Got a main dame, Audemar, and that's my main thang
Got a Rollie watch, her name Jane but she plain plain, so we call her plain Jane
Over her, I let it bang-bang like the fingers twistin' on a gang member sittin' in the chain gang
Nigga, please, I got old nigga cheese, y'all got hoe nigga knees
Can't let a faux nigga roll up, put a hole in your shit then let the ho nigga leave, man
Y'all niggas know a nigga T-O-R-Y, all my niggas got paws and they're always for the free
"O" for the fee, if a nigga throw a couple Gs, get a little nigga smoked for the free, man
1-5-0, first show, nigga, that's how I go, I was chosen with those melodies
Niggas hatin', I've been goin' up with those enemies
And the snakes keep blowin' it with those in the breeze
I'm up to no good, my boy's in the hood
With no young Jeezy, and no Jody Breezy, could blow 40 Gs
Still come back, who the fuck lookin' like the Ol' Dirty B from the Wu-Tang, nigga?
I could say nothin' on a motherfuckin' track, still go back plat' like Pootie Tang, nigga
Do your thing, nigga, hoppin' in the Mulsanne
Hotter than a blue flame lit up in the full tank, nigga
Man niggas better hide, niggas what, niggas what?
Nigga, niggas at the bottom of the food chain, nigga
Nigga so lame, can't crew hang, nigga, can't crew bang with ya, can't move a thang with ya'
See a little bad bitch walkin' down the block, but she lookin' at me 'cause your crew can't get her
I'm a dominator, moderator
Pass your chick like hot potato
Police non-cooperator
I won't tolerate a bitch that's talkin' crazy, not me, lil' nigga
I be on the beach with the sea, lil' nigga
I been triplin' up the doubles and threes, lil' nigga
Livin' it up with the women up in Vis, lil' nigga
Give it up all my niggas is tuckin', I hope a nigga's duckin'
I been drippin' and drippin' like a nigga's tippin' the bucket
I been whippin' these bitches and stickin' out my dick in public
They be lickin' a nigga to get to familiar fuckin'
I be fuckin' these women in ten-percent'd tinted windows
And I'm yellin' and tellin' I gotta get it, get to steppin'
I'm reppin' Umbrella forever, my niggas in abundance
I'm fly as propellers, you jealous
And if a nigga comin', I'm eatin' these niggas like ketchup and relish on a bun
I got the money to fund the wonders of what I wanted
And when I want it, I wanna feel like you can't front on it
I got your ex-chick and your next chick on a pole in my livin' room floor tryin' to dance all on it
As long as I can put my hands all on her, she said: "Handstand, a handstand'' and landed on it
I said damn, had to put it in her head, I ain't droppin' no bread
This is not that Gretel and the Hansel story
Got a Coupe full of hoes and the hose in the Coupe
To the Lamborghini doors to the floors and the roof
When I'm goin' in the booth, I'm exposin' the globe to the truth
They be knowin', I be showin' up with proof
Any faux nigga, any ho nigga, any low Joe Schmoe nigga better know
When I unload Get Low, Get Low, Get Low like Lil' Jon and the Eastside Boyz, nigga
And my lil' bitch type thick, uh
Neck is freezy as a ice-pick, uh
Out of sect just like a high kick, uh
Niggas gonna copy my style like a right click
All of my dogs'll kill you like Mike Vick
Light that pistol, put that boy in a Heimlich
I was handin' them Ls to Joyner and Don for comin' out actin' too lightskin
Nigga, I'm back in the Bentley, applyin' the pressure
Spittin' bunch of flyin' and firin' embers
So fuckin' hot, you'd think I died in the desert
Came back to fuck up your entire endeavor
You tryin' me? Never; your squad will get shot if ya try and be clever
My diamonds forever, designin' and linin' a bed up
Then give 'em a choice: which one you want die with, the .9 or Beretta?
I'm sorry for being intolerant, I got this violent temper
I like when I'm cold, I shoot a nigga, make him die in December
You been a bitch, as long as I can remember
You sayin' that you're gang, them niggas keep talkin'
I promise I'll silence your members then quiet your temple
While firing bullets that fly at your mental and pry at your denim
I'll hire somebody to fire the jet up then get up and send a shooter that'll fly if you rattle
I promise I'm high on momentum
Might think it's a setup, but find me a nigga
Might line that nigga for the paper
Let the hitter get to foldin', origami the nigga
The Louie luggage bustin' down on ya nigga
But true we thuggin', no insomnia, nigga

Nigga, play me, nigga, play me 'til the day I get to save me
I'm watchin' mad face and y'all niggas is movin' shady
Delusional, like
Like how that 1942 from Kylie house still got you talkin' crazy
Fuck a hail or handshake from niggas
The past months, the energy been mad fake from niggas
But I'm lifted up, bring Saran Wrap, talents gifted up
And if I drop this shit for a second, I'm back to pick it up
Unapologetically, jumped inside a pool and Kylie's face was lookin' heavenly
And though I'm innocent, they got this picture painted heavily
I pray that God remember me, faith done turn all my situations to a melon tree
Uh, J.R. Smith, it's the pot that piss
And you the last cat that should talk about some shots that hit
'Cause your performance and percentage, player
Rollin', ridin' benches, nigga, I'm from the trenches, nigga
You the type to buy a chick a eighty inch and still won't get a inch up in her
Yeah, I'm at they head, sprayin' hard like a spritzer, nigga
Baggin' niggas' ex bitches off a Insta' picture
Toes rufflin' through the sand like a Kingston nigga
Yeah, contradictions in your lines
With domestic pride crimes, we still have yet to find mines
Any time I brought these bitches up, you stressed it five times
How you try to kill the cat and then forget them nine lives?
I know it so well, I know these niggas so well
Jealous feelings, niggas best at catchin' like they Odell
It's rap niggas out here tellin' Megan she should go tell
But she won't tell the truth 'cause I'll be kicked up in my hotel
When the spiteful live shiesty, it's real trife
You niggas playin' Instagram, I'm playin' real life
Think I'm finna talk about a open case just for some likes?
I promise we done worked too many nights
Please, talkin' nights, we worked on a wage, flippin', turn through the page
We got Bun B on live sayin' I should burn in a cage
In these times of Black lives, he sayin' I should turn to a slave
If C pmiP heard that, then my nigga would have a rage right now
No diss to Pimp and Bun, but you made "Big Pimpin'," son
Pourin' champagne on women faces while they flick they tongue
I'm too young to give you lessons, but I'd like to give you one
Please stay the fuck up out my case, I ain't convicted, son
Chance the Rapp.. , too irrelevant
I replaced his line with, "My chain lookin' Heaven-sent"
Next line, next line, 'cause momma always told me, "Don't you chew that food unless you would eat that shit for a next time"
I made too much money with Roc Nation
For niggas to be thinkin' I can't correlate the fact that it's only niggas out your roster hatin'
Contemplatin' these thoughts in my head
Like, "How the fuck these niggas callin' me, threatenin' me not to make no statements?"
Huh, the nerve nowadays
I'm hittin' certain niggas with the swerve nowadays
Gimme one DreamDoll hit record , I'll wait
Ayy, Masika, this your chance, you in every Twitter debate
And every Shade Room comment like common sense ain't common sense
Like we be needin' your two cents and all your vents
Fakin' a kidnappin' for your OnlyFans
And tryna front like missin' kids was your intent
If that's the type of shit you teachin' Khari, then you should sit in a pen'
And watch people disagree in the end
You try to make it facts, but it's a L-I-E in the end
Oh, it ain't funny when it's your turn
When spectators got they lighters out with gasoline and wantin' yo' burn
Fuck a caption, this is facts with no cappin'
When Michael Jackson, Prince got they masters back, what happened?
Tory Lanez got his masters back just now and look what happened?
And Chris Brown, a Black man that changed his life for the right
And still, Black Twitter findin' ways to tear him down and bring him back in
A rapper catch a domestic, y'all start to talk that action
I feel like Famous Amos after all that happened
They want the downfall of every Black man, but I ain't goin'
They can't stop me, they can't stop, mmm

I guess I'm just different
But it's all good, nigga, I'ma continue to shine
You niggas could never stop me, nigga
You'll never put my back against the motherfuckin' wall, nigga
As long as my toes in the sand on God's green Earth, nigga

Come out swingin', like Broly, you niggas'll never stop me, nigga

Just know that I meant everything I said to you for sure
If in fact that you decide
Well I wanna take it all up off of your body, for sure
If in fact that you'll be mine
I wanna take it all up off of your body
Pretty miss Karrueche, I'm sippin' on this D'usse
I ain't throwin' no shade, I just want you to myself
Pretty miss Karrueche, I'm sippin' on this D'usse
I ain't throwin' no shade, I just want you to myself
If I'm wrong then let me be wrong, let me be wrong, baby
For thinkin' that you don't need someone
I can make you feel like your heart won't do
Like it's you first time goin' strong, I want you to be mine for sure
Now if you decide, you'll say you'll be mine
Sit that ass by my side, ohh
Shawty, don't deny, I ain't askin' for a reply
Just hard to say goodbye, oh baby
Pretty miss Karrueche, I'm sippin' on this D'usse
I ain't throwin' no shade, I just want you to myself
Pretty miss Karrueche, I'm sippin' on this D'usse
I ain't throwin' no shade, I just want you to myself

For thinkin' that you don't need someone
I can make you feel like your heart won't do
Like it's you first time goin' strong, I want you to be mine for sure
Make you feel like your heart won't do
Like it's you first time goin' strong, I want you to be mine
At the top sippin', baby
If I'm wrong, let me know, I gotta know
At the top sippin', baby
Can we smoke one more time? I gotta know
At the top sippin', baby
Just to go back to that night, all I want
I know what to do with it, I'ma keep it true with it
I know, I know what to do with it
A man can only dream of it, so I'ma dream of you
I know what to do with it, I'm not being rude with it
This ain't for Teyana, this one here for you, ohh baby
Bring your ass to Toronto, all I wanna do is
Bring you to the condo
So we can smoke
And you can let your stresses go
How personalI took the 95 to get from West Palm
Think I need a break from everything
Yes, I'm stressed way more than usual
I'm gettin' things back in order
Getting things back to how they used to be
Back to when the scrutiny had no effect on you and me
I miss driving with you in the passenger 
Feet up on my dash, we would see the sun lapse
Take you home, you would come see me before class
Makes more sense for you to crash with me but you never ask, oh why
Told you there's no need to be shy, oh why
I be waiting in the meantime, oh why
You always got me on stand by
When you know I need love
I'm missing when we was us
Miss when I wasn't famous, that's when we could be us
Kiss right in the street, fuck if anybody sees
Just friends, I don't think anybody believes
Hard to keep it PG with a nigga like me, goddamn
I fell in love with you, I fell in love, girl
I miss us
Nah, I won't front, got me so sprung
'Cause you, you're one of one 
It's no rush 
I'm missing your touch 
I'm missing your touch, oh
Missing when you kept in touch, oh-woah-oh 
When you kept in touch
Phone ringing
I took the 401 to get from Yorkdale
You're still looking like the baddest thing I done seen
Deflated before it started flattening
Way before the singer-rapper thing started happening
We were playing checkers, I was just tryna get back to king
I miss black tinted windows on your whip looking Amish
I'm just tryna put it down
You can put it on my tab
I'm putting you on your back
Then putting it in you slow
Then putting it in on a track, oh yeah
And I always tried to fall through
Ain't no Ws and dubbing me when I call you
I'm in first class
Thinking 'bout how you would get me right
Damn near made me miss the flight
Fucking you and get it right, yeah
You gon' bring me to that first time we fucked on the futon
Back then, I would do anything to get you alone
You would know me, all bullshit aside
So hit my line, I miss us
I fell in love with you, I fell in love, girl
I miss us 
Nah, I won't front, got me so sprung
'Cause you, you're one of one 
It's no rush 
I'm missing your touch 
I'm missing your touch, oh
Missing when you kept in touch, oh-woah-oh 
When you kept in touchI find it funny how niggas start talkin' money
I'm livin' lovely, apartment far from the bunjee
I remember us livin' not too far from the junkies, the flunkees
That tried to punk me on corners but never sunk me
I swear, in this bitch, yeah I'm killin' this year
Them boys hated, they gon' feel it this year
I bought a 'Rari, I only drove in it once, I'm movin' different this year
I'm leavin' thousands, talkin' millions this year
When niggas really talkin', talkin' over, talk it over
Renegotiate and make the play and they cough it over
I crossed over like Iverson when he dropped the shoulder on Jordan
The feelin' more than the sport when you winnin' fuck how they feelin'
The feelings got left aside, I told them to step aside
I'm really eatin', I'm orderin'  extra sides, you know me
'Round the block, glovers spittin' them hot flows
My sense smells like Michelle was touchin' Barack's clothes
Presidential, the flow is so evidential
At the clearport customs, I barely show my credentials
Don't need it tinted, I want you to know who's in it
Had me offended last time that I walked in the Holt Renfrew
Let's break it down for 'em, account this
If every show is a hunnid thou' for him then that mean
A hunnid minutes on stage will equal a hunnid K
That's one thousand a minute so please don't get offended
If I walk inside a store and spend thirty-five in it
'Cause, to me, that's just thirty-five minutes
Land in Jamaica, sip on a Guinness and get it
Who wanna witness, my nigga? I'm really sick with the shiznit
I brought big Poppy out at the SumFest
Sean Kingston watched it from the side stage
I made triple the advance that he had gave me in my first year
Forty-five minutes of me on stage
And I'm not amazed, I think the tables turnin'
I think you learn from the bridge you burn when you see it burnin'
I think you learn from the world when you see it turnin'
I went from being a server to being this platinum deserver, you feel me?
Did a song with Meek Milly, called it "Litty"
Really I just did that shit for the city in love with Philly
God, this chinchilla fur on me, just in case it gets chilly
Burner on my side pocket, just that's in case you get illy out here
Me and Travis Scott almost fought at the Mala Luna
We both agreed shortly after that it was music
We possibly could be doin' that's bigger than tryna ruin it
So my apologies, nigga, just forgive me for doin' it
History made in New York City, we called a truce at the tower
I only brought a couple niggas with me
The beef was finished as soon as we took the picture, the world was watchin'
The attention in the industry started shiftin' to me
Lord forgive 'em, Lord forgive 'em, I was trippin' all the time
I spit subliminal dissin', just tryna rip shit
Not realizin' if I took the time to kick it and me and Drake mendin' bridges it'd probably equal to winnin'
Got the hardhead flow, money come in so thick
Them niggas call it hard bread dough
I'm in this all red four seater, I'm leanin' like the '06 fours
I said I'd stop freestylin' but fuck it, oh well
A nigga flow so well, I'm like a samplin' kit
Give a fuck 'bout who get pissed about by samples and skits
Niggas mad I'm remixin' they shit-pshh
Fuck out of here, nigga, stop being a bitch
I think it's time we cut the silence by niggas that's talkin' violent
Speak of silence and give 'em coffins and violins playin'
R&B niggas with Sisqó haircuts, wildin' and stylin'
They dissin', guess they just tryna go viral, I feel 'em
This your favorite song, this gon' be your favorite song
'Cept when I say it, it's really the people's favorite song
You did a vid dissin' to flex the i8
I could've flexed a 'Rari or Wraith, but nigga, I ain't
Instead, I bought my house the other day, I'm flexed in the paint
Real estate, I'm property shoppin', bitches probably watchin'
Got the Gadget-Go flow, Nobu and So-Ho
I've been crossed by some niggas I used to go toe-to-toe for
Blow for blow flow, sick enough to eat a blowfish
G5 jet playin' Go-fish, eatin' gold fish
Just for the record, I did this shit for the hopeless
Just drove a Rolls through the hood on the corner where I was homeless
It's FargoI got it in the worst way
Got me trapped in your love cage
Listen, listen
Your eyes don't glisten, glisten
Like they used to
And this ain't something that I'm used to, no
Uh, I landed in Miami with the top
Tryin' spend a lil time with a bad one
I got a lil motto, any bitch that you fuck
Make her badder than the last one
I'm pullin' in a S50, pullin' in a fuckin' S50, shawty
Stuntin' in a S50, stuntin' in a fuckin' S50

Shawty get it poppin', shawty called Keiyanna
Okay, well okay

Hit the trap and have it jumping
Turning nothing into something
Peeling off the corner flexing on them niggas
Shawty know a nigga came here from nothing
I got the gas on me
Being broke was the reason why all of these females would pass on me
Now I pull up in that S550 and I dash on 'em
And you know I don't spend any cash on 'em
When I'm pulling up inside that thing you know I do my thing
And I drop the top on all these niggas in the way
And this is for the times a nigga shitted on me
You shitted on me, now you see the tables turning my way
So I gotta flex, I gotta flex, I gotta flex on you

A young nigga gotta hop out and do some

Nigga, you know I-I-I got news for you
Everybody know I'm paid only you fronted
The fame made a nigga lose a lot of friendships
The fame made these niggas do a lot fuck shit
Couple good girls that I lost to the cause

Young rich nigga on his way up

You know the devil working gotta pray up
And I just pray that all my niggas paid up and ball like lay up

What I did to ya, why you fronting on me
Did I
Hit the trap and have it jumping
Turning nothing into something
Peeling off the corner flexing on them niggas
Shawty know a nigga came here from nothing
Can't believe when I look back at how I did it
Fuck around and made something, I made something
Made something
Made something of myself
I made somethingAdrenaline pumpin', heart pacing racing, altercations, we lit
Blood drip stain the ground, boy get down, you hit
Same hood, different day, same whip, different clip
Lettin' off, somehow we end up in the same shit
And she don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
She got herself inside of this situation in the first place
Brooklyn Myrtle Ave. is her birth place
Facin' the city, quotin' Biggie on all her worst days
I used to take the train with her so none of these lames get her
The danger of livin' from where she was at was a plain picture
I used to paint pictures on how we could gain riches together
Instead of listen, she kinda just blew me off
Paid it no mind but it kind of just threw me off
I guess I figured everybody want riches and of course
But she just wanted a better family because her parents divorced
Early, her papa, he was taken by the force
Mother on crack and she never had time to bathe her
'Stead she gave her to her uncle, her brother who played the savior
'Til the day he started datin' this chick
That had put him up on mad pills and fuckin' up mad bills
She told me that one night he had got so fucked up
He fell asleep on his sofa, then woke up a new persona
And walked inside of her room and told her remove her clothing
And forcefully started chokin' her and tellin' her not to move
'Fore she could even finish, she broke out in tears and did it
Told me that for years, this night was a repetition, a feeling of fear
That she couldn't seem to exit or quit it, the feeling was there
Started talkin' lower as she told me come here
She said she had to make choices
So she got involved with niggas that make noise with them thangs, you feel
Ran off in her uncle's spot with the stainless steel
Put the burner to his face with this aim to kill
And said, she don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
She got herself inside of this situation in the first place
Figured that this intimidation was the worst case
She sat back and blew six in that boy face *gun shots*
Shot, him, dead
Said I want you on my head
No, I won't leave you lonely
You hold your head up high
I won't let go
'Cause I can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
He don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
He got himself inside of this situation in the first place
He had no father figure, he told me that his papa got shot in the face
And he can't wait to find out who his killer
He dedicated his life and now wants to know this
To find out who had a motive to kill his only father
He felt, it had to be somebody close
It couldn't be somebody far away that didn't know him, but take this part in
When he was younger, he used to roll with his cousin
A woman that used to show him the ropes
She used to tell him
"Don't ever let no nigga or woman touch you
And if somebody do then all they would hear was the baka-baka-baka-baka"
One day, he was on the block rollin'
Then, this crack fiend woman came to him, told him
That she was his mother, man, that shit had him frozen
He ain't want to believe her 'til she said, "Boy, you got a birthmark above your scrotum
A scar up on your eye came from when you was four
When you fell off in the road"
At that point, he looked at her face and he froze
She told him hold on, it's something she gotta show him
She says to him, "I was gon' wait until you got older
But something was on my mind, was pressin', I had to show you
The whole block know me and the whole block know you
The whole block been knew this story but they ain't told you"
His mom says to him, "I hope you know your pop was a good man
But he just had some nonsense to him
Huh, well, one night, he's fucked up on the pills
I'm tryna tell him stop but everything I'm sayin' fails
You see, your lil' cousin in Brooklyn where we would leave ya, uh
I know she love you but the story's more deeper, uh
You see, your father used to be a creeper
He used to fuck her, used to touch her, used to beat her
Used to leave her so confused she would lace her own coke and reefer
Wait, I know you wanna interrupt but this get deeper
You've been livin' this mission, you tryna figure who's the nigga
Or the perpetrator of killin' your pops, nigga?
When your cousin is the reason he got shot, nigga
She put six shots in him out the Glock, nigga"
His anger was dwellin' all on his mind
He didn't know what to do, he started grippin' his .9
And uh, before he knew it, he aimed it up at his mom
And uh, huh- *gun shots* -he shot her right in the spine
He said, "This is why my life has been full of lies
Don't nobody care for me, fuck it, what's the use in tryin'?
This Glock on my side, if I put it to my mind
I know that I'ma die but in Heaven, I'll be alive" *gun shot*
Adrenaline pumpin', heart pacing racing, altercations, we lit
Blood drip stain the ground, boy get down, you hit
Same hood, different day, same whip, different clip
Lettin' off, somehow we end up in the same shit
Stunt, get jumped on, slashed or dumped on
Same block you pump on is the spot you get slumped on
Tory told me the story, it sounded a little crazy
A little Nas, a little 2Pac, Brenda's havin' a baby
How much pressure can you take 'fore you snap or break? Love turn to hate?
Fuck shit or fake, your next move may raise the murder rate
From average to savage, to semi-automatics
It's tragic how the static'll have us goin' at it *gun shot*
Said I want you on my head
No, I won't leave you lonely
You hold your head up high
I won't let go
'Cause I can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonelyYou got, somethin' that I do want, somethin' that you do got
You, so fly, I'll fly your ass, I'll fly you to Dubai
Move round the blue sky, drive in a new ride
You so bad you can't come, round my niggas
'Cause all us thirsty, really though
We be goin' in, like we all got curfews, really though
By the way, who the fuck, is knock-knockin' at the function?
Man, I hate when a nigga cockblockin' at the function
I'm tryna get laid tonight
Tryna find a group of all girls who down for their ladies night
'Cause you know it's on when I come
Pullin' up clean in my Nike Airs

In my Yves Saint Laurent shirts and palm sleeves
But you know, that it's all for you
And when I'm down on the ground and fucked up

I'm a number one nigga in no time
I been waiting for a nigga to give me the showtime
In the jungle waiting for you to slip on the oak vine
I'ma do this nigga like I was chewing a pork rind nigga
Eminem couldn't get ya to a million on the 'Gram
Chris Brown tried, nigga failed both times
I done took ya page to a million in a day
If you ask me, nigga, I'm ya motherfucking cosign
I'ma hit the pussy ass nigga with a clothesline
I'ma have to catch a nigga slipping in my own time
I just took the flame on a private ass plane
Out to Massachusetts, catch this nigga slipping in his hometown
Ya see what go around come around and go around
So I got his hoe going round like it go around
Let these niggas know I'm not the one to toe-to-toe around
Singing ass nigga not the one to leave your hoe around
I'm about to hit him with the end of the K
Word to my niggas in Heaven I'm 'bout to send em away
I'm exhausted I kill this nigga two times
24 hours man this shit been a repetitive day
Nigga tell me is it Joyner Lucas, Lucas Joyner?
I'm the nigga who destroy ya
Coupe deploy ya, label drop ya, who's the lawyer?
Buy ya contract from them back and be who employ ya
Oops, I'm going, who's condoning? Juice and jonesing
Met ya bitch she too conjointed
Tryna ask this pussy ass nigga who the fuck want smoke
But the lightskin niggas in ya crew too spooked to join in
I'm a nasty nigga, then you could ask these nigga
The shotty dumping popping up outta the backseat, nigga
I'm 'bout to leave his body bloody like a maxi, nigga
I tax these niggas, get at these niggas, attack these niggas
The venom is arachne, nigga
I'm 'bout kill da man and da man that done backed these niggas
And blam any man that'll try to dap you niggas
And clap any stan fan that attract you niggas
See ya daddy was a musician that never made  it
'Cause when you was born nigga it was you or him
Shattered knowing he would never make it as an artist
And the odds of his life prolly be 2 to 1
But I give it to him 'cause he didn't run
I guess he figured, "man when you look at it in a nutshell
All I got is a failed music career and
My revenge is giving that shit to my son"
Nigga I'ma flossy nigga
They try to toss me nigga
The 45th I get em off me nigga
I block niggas Chris Bosh these niggas
I got figures pish posh to niggas
I dump niggas, jump, criss cross these niggas
The pump leave 'em slumped, in the car seat nigga
The skunk in the trunk was an awkward nigga
That thought he didn't need to have caution with him
A cornball with a Boston fitted
I said hold up my nigga man this shit crazy
You fucked AYLEK$ man that shit crazy
Nigga said he out here running threesomes with the
Nigga that's in court dealing with the kid cases
I'ma hit a stain then I hit a bad one
Pull up on the nigga hold em up for ransom
I got five plaques this year, you did a whole song with Eminem and still don't even have one nigga
Damn, my lil homie that’s a bad one nigga
Really feel bad for you it's a sad one nigga
Hold your head steady maybe you could have one nigga
Hit me for a hook and maybe get a plaque young nigga
Shout go out to Wayno and Ak my nigga
Tomorrow they'll be talking 'bout you got smacked young nigga
From the pack my nigga
I'm keeping this shit a stack, my nigga
That "Litty" verse was wack, my nigga
They go hard my dawg, but I go harder nigga
Atcha head with the fade like a barber nigga
Try to come for the boat and I'ma harbor niggas
Be smart like a Harvard nigga don't start with niggas
And he got a problem with us
But nigga, I know how to solve it nigga
This is my son
I'ma tell 'em like Star Wars, "Lucas, I am your father" nigga
You a perpetrating, work for hire, twerk for payment
Busta Rhyme impersonating, worthless baby, irks him daily
Hurts to say it, burger flipping, birthed in 80s
Tryna be a 90s baby, thirty something tryna chase it
Tryna make it, rocks designer, kinda fakes it
Hates to face it
That he'll never be a nigga that be placed for A-list, niggas damn
Here's what he's thinking right now
"I'm Joyner Lucas, why did I start it with this guy?
Tory Lanez coming back what am I gonna do this time?
They ain't like none of my diss lines
Everybody knows I can spit it in quick time
Even if the lines is as shitty as 6ix9ine's
But this time they ain’t really letting me get by
Fuck I'm finna do with this shit now?
Damn I know this nigga finna be wild
Knowin' this nigga bout to kill me on it OD now
Don't nobody ever wanna book me for a show
I ain't got no songs when I go I spit freestyles
Try to make songs 'bout depression
But nobody ever get it
So I take it out on popping niggas beats now
I ain't never ever trapped
I ain't never slung a gat
But the world don't know so fuck it, I'm a G now"
Man, what the fuck wrong with him?
I know something wrong with him
I got a hundred bunch o' bullets 'bout to put 'em all in him
Nigga walked in with a hundred rounds in him
And he's seen a nigga chicken I was comin' down in it
Glock nine nigga gotta run around with it
I'ma son a nigga, keep it at least one-a-round with it
Backpack niggas ain't sellin' no records
Better dumb it down with it when you come around with it
This shit is easy man
Yo it's crazy nigga
I'm really-, I'm really-, I'm really being very generous, you know?
Like I'm really doing you a favor, it's not a lot of niggas in my status that come down just to, you know, to come down and spank you niggas, pause man
It's crazy, but you know
I'ma do for you what niggas didn't do for me - that's older brother status
So if you blow from this point on, I'm your cosign nigga, you know what it is
Ayy Slow, that's facts right?
Big facts, word to Ralph, nigga, word to big Jevante too, nigga
You know what's going on nigga-, you know what the fuck's going on, nigga
One Umbrella gang, niggaI got a million flows, I can go silly with those
I got a pocket rocket
Down to cock and chop and pop a nigga that really impose
Niggas that's with me is villains in hoodies
That lost all they good and they feelings on road
It's so appealing, the feeling of killing a nigga that pose
Get Milli Vanillied with those
Turn a beef plate to a cheesesteak
Bitch, I be really in Philly with those
Neck rocky as a blizzard, a nigga flex gotten bigger
My wrist is so chilly, it froze
Really I'm colder than ever, my niggas goin' for whatever
Niggas gripped up, fifth tucked in the snow storm or the weather
Sandstorm or the desert, hands drawn on a Dessy
Leave his whole body bloody
Like shorty done put in her tampon on already
Shooting with a Vietnam cannon out the Peter arm on the levy
See, the charm on already
We go to jail, this shit'll be fire, we'll meet up with friends
'Cause all of our mans gone-gone already
Nigga the-, nigga the-, uh
I'ma do a three in week, I gave the Jeep the receipt
Either the double-R stitching, it's that or the Bentley B in the seat
I got my D in a freak, I gotta be in repeat
She wanna eat every morning
I treat it like porridge and gave her the cream of the wheat
And I rock it like P and a B
I don't cop it less it's Louie, Gucci on the pocket
Or even a D and a G, 'cause the way that the money piling
I'll be wildin' 'til a nigga make about a B in a week
Fuck niggas hating on me
But I'm Gary Payton, always on the team with the green
And the money counter, 'cause when I'm accounting
It be money coming in and coming out it, paper cut the money
Dummy niggas, I been thumbing out it
Trying not to run up out it in a fist fight
With a knife, nigga brought a gun up out it
Don't you run up out it, lil nigga
Uh, hit him with a mini MAC
Is he really that bad that I gotta hit him with a bigger gat?
Matter fact, riddle me that
I'm literally at the spot that he said he'd be at, but where is he at?
Like, really nigga? Is you really tellin' me that?
Like I ain't prepared to hit him with a felony act?
Like, what you thought, I would never react?
Have a nigga lookin' like he tryna fight in Smash Bros
When a nigga put a whole shell in his back
Fuck niggas yelling it back
Niggas get high and start hating on a real nigga
It's like a nigga smokin' on a jealousy pack
Look, lil' nigga, uh
I got the remedy, I got the shooters with hidden identities
Fuck who you send at me
I got a stack on me long as a ruler and centipede
I got the Genovese, I got the energy
I got the money, the power, the enemies
I go to business
I'm asking these niggas for 60 percent of the entity
No one defending me
Niggas is talking, but no one offending me
Niggas know what the result of the end'll be
Niggas won't know how to find where they men'll be
I'm a way different nigga on Hennessy
I got the recipe, none of y’all niggas sit next to me
Guard where your head and ya chest'll be
I suggest you niggas never go testin' me
I suggest you niggas never go testin' me, nigga
I promise y'all niggas I do this shit in my sleep, it's easy
I come to the studio and just say shit and it comes out that way
You know what I mean?
I promise y'all we down to go 36 hundred thousand rounds with anybody
Let these niggas know that all that rapping fast shit
We can do it too, nigga
Niggas be thinking they got that special sauce
Not today, nigga
Ain't that right, man?
Y'all know what the fuck goin' on, man
Who next? Who next? Who next? For real, who next?
Lemme know, lemme know, I'm off this, I'm off this

Mama died same year my sister had the kid

Five of us puttin' up for one room, landlord straight buggin'
Roaches on the ceiling, living room straight thuggin'

Big homie asked a nigga what I'm down for
Looked him in the eye and said to do it 'til I'm bigger than ya
I'm whopping xans off, kicked out the house in Brampton
Had a nigga trappin' out in Danforth
Taking TTC to get the figures, just me and my little nigga
Ain't have no hittas with us
Was with the thugs, dealers, plugs, killers with slugs
All my niggas was plugs, all my bitches was dubs
Left me out when I was tryna make it did what it does
Can't forget about the drought when they put six in my plug
Only thing I gotta do is get my mom out the mud
Only thing I gotta do is get it poppin' and blow it
Only thing I gotta do is hit my wrist with the soda
Niggas thought it was over, but bitch I live by the slogan
I told you

Now you're up and they feel like they should be up with you, nigga
I remember nights when I was starving and hungry and ballin' and bummy
And busted cause my car wasn't running and woah
Doggy, all I want is a onion
The game it was callin' me audibly like someone confronted, but no
Niggas never gave a nigga nothing
Fuck I look like giving niggas something?
Made 100K this week, that's on my dead mama
Spend a 117 and I ain't even know it
Dawg I swear my coldest nights it wasn't even snowing
Mama told me since a youngin' I would be a soldier
I played the watch out on the block you used to see me scopin'
Respect the shooters that said "Youngin' go, we about to blow this"
Hop in another one, nigga

It's the year 2009 and I done found myself a crib
I ain't got no dough, but I done found myself a bitch
Dollars and success is what my niggas tryna get
Young as fuck but fake ID gon' get me in the VIP
I done said fuck school, fuck the teachers and the public
I'd rather count this money with the thuggers and the junkies
The teachers used to tell me "Boy you ain't gon' 'mount to nothin'"
The only love I felt was from the dealers and the hustlers
We gon' do the most, so tell them niggas GABOS
Seen my nigga Harvey, he went and copped him a Ghost
Through the windshield, the centerfold on the door
Ten below on you hoes, getting dough on you folks
Getting dough on these fours, gettin' money it show
These checks are looking silly, I'm gettin' funny on hoes
Funny how I'm stuntin' in somethin' flooded in stones
Put them hunnids on hold, put them runners on go
Secure the bagCan someone tell that bitch, take her shoes off at the door?
When she walk all on my marble floor, I stunt like I'm supposed to
Black dreads hangin' off my niggas, shouts to Noah
Walk inside my crib, see dough so thick she can't even fold
Tell me why your bitch keep patrollin' like she 5-0
Say that she my bitch, but that bitch ain't even side ho
She gon' keep on workin' it for Fargo 'til her thighs broke
I can't throw no benjis if I ever see my side broke
Talk about your money, that's that shit that I don't gotta
Would talk about your bitch, but tell the truth, man I forgot her
I'm smokin' on some potent shit, that's loud as a whole choir
And I don't say shut up no more, I just tell a ho quiet
They know why, shit 'cause

Niggas speakin' to you, but ain't really talkin'
Sittin' in the trap, eatin' cup of noodles
Higher than a nigga, Andy Milonakis
Niggas used to get it by the 8-ball

Shit, don't forget to tell yo' bitch, take your shoes off at the door
When she walk on top this Persian rug, I stunt like I'm supposed to
Backwood swingin', smokin', hangin' out the door
Black drawers showin', jaw glowin' from my gold
Ghetto boujee nigga, order steak but eat them ramen noodles
Don't love yo' bitch, just fuck yo' bitch when I got time to do it
I say she lyin' if she say she wasn't tryna do it
Fargo ain't no rookie, man, that boy a pussy connoisseur
I know she won't fuck a famous nigga and be lit
Just like I'm playin' tag 'cause I can't fuck unless she it

Went to the trenches, came back to a nigga
You flew away and came back to a nigga
You used to keep it so thorough, then when you would come around you wouldn’t even dap all my niggas
I loved myself when I was in the trap
I loved myself when I was in the trenches
I love my love for people when I used to see 'em walk beside me sleeping on them benches
But one day you saw me and you held me down
Kept it real and shawty you held it down
Wasn’t nothin’ niggas could tell me now
Wasn’t nothin’ that I couldn’t sell out
I just had to get the money and get it
Got the product, stack it, flip it and split it
With my niggas in the trenches
Baby, you the one that held a nigga down and I will not forget it, yeah
You loved, you loved me
You loved, you loved me
You loved, you loved me

Pulled up in the Lamb', should've pulled up in the BM
Rippers in my denim 'cause a young nigga was flexin'
And if we end it early, baby girl, then it was destined
I even had to stop, answerin' your calls
A nigga had you trappin' with the scammers and the dawgs
Drivin' over border with the hammers in the car
When the cops pulled me over, would've hand it to my dawgs
I mean, who needs love with these hammers in my fists?
And she gon' fuck me over, give a damn about a bitch
Debit, credit cards on me, slammin' in this bitch

Whip a couple litres now
Trap house got too hot and now I'm trappin' out my fiend's house

Money on me lookin' like it went and got a facelift
You been trippin', I been trippin', still ain't on the same shit
You still in my kitchen, arguin' about the same shit
Who and what and why and why I don't call you my main bitch
Everything is changin'
Friends turn to strangers, friends turn to dangers
Friends ain't your friends if they givin' ultimatums
Flippin' all the pages, dip off in the Range, oh
I done been through all these stages
You just act so different now, ain't nothin' that amazes
Me when you be trippin', how you speak when you be trippin'
I can see that you be slippin', that's tequila that you sippin', I know
Yes, that I was trippin', I envisioned somethin' different from the situation
You was my bitch, not only that, you was my nigga
Got me through when all these niggas hated
You started takin' me too serious and that's when all this desolated 
You yourself don't even know the full story
Why you lettin' people escalate it?
And I know you got them people in yo' ear
But we both know the situation, niggas hate it
Fuck all that for now, we'll talk about it when it's time
It feel like my lil' baby been confiscated
Taken away from me, I was makin' a way for us
We was trippin' off them couples, tryna do it how they do it
We was up and she was up and I was up, we PJ flew it
It was fluent, had us movin' like it's water to the fluid
I'm your water, you're the cruise, I had it movin' how you movin', woo
Out of mind and out of sight, I been gettin' right
I slid with the crodies, I been on the flight
Nine bands in my pocket, .19 on my right
I been outta pocket, I had to get right
I pray to the Lord, yeah, I had to get right
Lord, please give me patience when I see them lie
I hope one day me and you see eye to eye
I hope one day me and you see eye to—
We both know what happened 
What happened to passion
Doin' the most and you know that it's takin' me back in
Hidin' emotions and stories, but you know it don't work
A couple things won't ever change
The common propaganda around my name is never strange
But when does it get strange?
When you start lyin' to your best friend 'bout us doin' things
And hopin' she ain't entertain?
Or is it strange when the lovin' come with secrets and the games?
When the world unveil your curtains and all they laughin' at's your pain
But does it change when we both reveal that both our mothers died?
And we still dealin' with some pain and need someone to entertain
Or does it change when you break down in my arms and start cryin'?
And feelin' like you alone and I tell you, "Everything's okay"
And I know I ain't runnin' game, even Munchie know my aims
But will you ever know my name and not just Tory from this fame?
Will we ever talk about this? Will we ever console again?
Or will we keep on actin' like I put you in danger and some pain?
And when you hop back in the car with me, you knew everything was safe
Pshht, please don't let these niggas make you change
We both know what happened that night and what I did
But it ain't what they sayin'
But when the feeling's change, the pain start oozin' from the heart
And start cruisin' through the vein
Start leakin' out your mouth when you hop on the live and talk live
It's oozin' through your brain, listen
We watched them animes, still granted from my player phase
Potentials of bein' Bey and Jay, just watchin' for my fan base
I'm just tryna get back to the days when you would hop back on the jet
Land in Miami for a span of days and stay with me
Or back when I would do the same, Atlanta plane from A to Z
And pull up in your driveway in the AMG
When 4oe would run up out the door and you would come outside, lookin' gracefully
And I'd step out the car and see your two arms embracin' me
We both playin' games with money, powers and fames
But just tell me how it changed, have your feelings rearranged?
Or deep down, are they the same? 'Cause I just wanna reconcile with ya
Spend a while with ya, send some flowers, watch a smile hit ya
After Kellen do your hair, you send a wild picture
Then you callin' me to come step out with ya
Type of shit I like to do, type of ways I like to move
All directions in my view, still pointin' right to you, damnYou don't know my
Makin' love to the beat so slow
Makin' love to the beat, girl, it sounds so slow
Come and fuck wit' a G, girl, you already know
I got a hunnid on me for the night
Shawty, don't you leave for the night
No, you don't know my name
Lately, all these bitches want is my fame
You don't know that you the one on my brain
I hit you with that late night text when I'm on the road
Girl, you know I'm tryna vibe wit' you
When you come into my city, I'ma slide wit' you
Side bitch droppin', pussy pop whenever I'm wit' you
Girl, you might've heard my songs, but you don't
Girl, I got a thing for you
Hustle with them dealers when it's time to get that bling for you
Knock it out the ring for you
Whoa, shawty, you know
Can I get a ring from you?
On the phone or a message, just somethin'
Can we get past all these one-word discussions?
I need to know, girl, I need to know somethin' 
'Cause you don't know my name
You don't know my name
'Cause you don't know my name, whoa
You don't know my name
'Cause you don't know my name 
You don't know my name 
'Cause you don't know my name
Girl, it's obvious you got some problems
It's obvious you got some issues
What if God sent me all in your life
And it's obvious I'm here to fix you?
When I can't go no longer, I need someone stronger
To hold on to get through
And I stay by your side, girl, you know I'ma ride
And come to your rescue
You say that you know my name, the songs that I sing
The set that I bang, the shit that I claim
You don't know 'bout me, I've noticed
But you gon' know 'bout me, I know this
'Cause you don't know my name
You don't know my name
'Cause you don't know my name, whoa
You don't know my name
'Cause you don't know my name 
You don't know my name 
'Cause you don't know my name
I fell in love with somebody, who doesn't even know my name
Know my name, no, no
And I know this, I'm ashamed
By my name, I'm not talkin' 'bout the name you call me, I'm talkin' 'bout who I am
And I know you don't know my name 
She knows the songs that I sing, all the shit that I claim
And even the set that I bang, but I'm certain she don't know
I'm tryna figure it out, but if she's walkin' out
She will never know my name, can't let her goShe don't dance, but she dance for me

Thumbin' through the bands and you dancin'

Fuck you boys, I did this by my damn self 
I just fell in love with my bando 
I just fell in love with a bad one
I get in the club, sneak a snub in the back door
All my boss bitches in Céline too 
She ain't wanna fuck me, she ain't mean to 
Diamonds dancin' on me and she dancin' on the pole

Got a chicken in my kitchen and she cookin' for me
Got to B-Town, all these brown boys start to lookin' like me
I'm the one they wanna see, now all they bookin' is me
She hold me down so I ain't got time for no side hoes
She hold it down and she won't say shit to the 5-0
Blow it down like every week we smokin' 5 oz
If the doors don't go up, we don't want that Lambo' 
She don't dance, but she dance for me 
She ain't even tryna get these bands from me

I'm thinkin' of all the times that you dubbed me
Now that I'm poppin', you got me right where I wanna
Right where I wanted to be when you would love me
Caught you slippin' in LIV and sippin' bubbly
You took a look at these niggas, ain't none above me
I tried to give you my heart, but girl, you don't know
I tried to show you affection, but no, it won't show
I told you, "Baby, just wait, we need some time and all"
I told you just love me, give me some time to ball
The way you lookin' is like a thousand dollars
With my confidence, took every ounce to holler
I really hope you never get to love me
I wanna be somewhere stuntin', sippin' on bubbly
Not even a thought of you in my mind
Visions of you went blind
Ooh, you used to call just to tell me
That you ain't all the way get it, but, girl, you felt me
Part of that reason why I always try to tell you
You held it down, I'ma get you the bag with the Chanel C's
'Cause it was us against the world, fuck what they tell me
I figured they was hatin' on us and it was jealousy
But I should've listened to the shit they was tellin' me
I thought you was takin' a W, it was just an L on me
Now I'm caught up in this situation where L-O-V got the best of me
I'm tryna find somethin', tryna align somethin'
Still hopin' and prayin' that you'll be my somethin'
Out layin', and hopin' prayin' that you done datin' me
I know I treat you better than your man, yeah, fuck that nigga
Tryna treat you better than he can
I know you that you ain't really 'bout to dub me

But you see, you and me, we still a thing 
Really, baby, you should never get to love me
Pillow talkin' with niggas and tryna dub me
You really got the audacity to discuss me

And it'd kill me to say these things about you but
I know the way you think about the two of us
I know the way you think about movin' on
But me, girl, I'm not used to maneuverin' much
Tell me I'm doin' enough

Shit we used to do was authentic
Why we had to put our hearts in it?
Love came, put some scars in it
Feelings change, put some darts in it
Heart is changin', left me sharp-witted
Left the bike and left the bar spinnin'
Everybody play they parts in it
Justin dropped you straight into the crib
He be lowkey hatin' on the kid
You and Munchie drunk inside a ally
Been anticipatin' from the telly
Walked in the penthouse ready
Walked in the penthouse wavy
Finna put his dick off in her belly
Ride me like a motherfuckin' lady
House call to Jordyn Woods' house
Knocked out and woke up on the couch
Woke back and drove to your crib
This time I just know what it is
Next time the pool with you and Kylie
Hoped in it coolin', nigga wilin'
She was lookin' like a fuckin' angel
Lookin' like a baby in a manger
Hop step, went to the car
Me and Kylie still off in the pool
We just chillin', kickin' shit, was cool
Both of us didn't know you was trippin'
Even though I got a crush on Kylie, I woulda left with you if I knew you was dippin' for the simple reason
You invited me but I can't act like shawty didn't excite me
I had took a wrong turn that-night
But not the turn that everybody think
I wasn't the wrong one that night, you was just too drunk to even see it
Wasn't anticipatin', I'd never put you in no situation
I've never even had an argument with ya
A conversation is all I'm bargainin' with ya
'Cause you was my nigga for real
And if you can agree, then you owe me that
Our mothers would tell us to do the right thing, and it's friendship, my nigga, you told me that
So even when niggas is comin' at me on they Twitter and Insta, I'm over that
'Cause what's a couple months of memes of me, if it means, I'm gon' get my homie back?
Fuck it, let's talk about it
Do you think anybody else inside of the business
That know they ain't did it would sit here and listen to critics
While niggas is trippin' and bashin' me?
Out here attackin' me, actually
Only reason why I let 'em do it, is 'cause I figured that you would've called a nigga
But look it's been over two months and all you did was stall, my nigga
The drama is bigger than ever
I thought that we both were bigger than that
Yeah, and the shit that I did, it was wack
But you don't get your nigga back like that
Just listen to Jigga on that one track
Song cryin' while it play in the back
I never cared to be that nigga in your fame shawty, I was playin' it back
We never had a thing, when we met each other, it was never a thing like that
Spendin' this time's what made us attached
Spendin' my time's what made you react
I'm only human, I gotta be real, and tell you, that the pain done came with that
Even the feelin' is strange at that
How you gon' up and just change the facts?

Stampede comin' while I walk out the arena
On a phone call with you, tryna make the team 'cause
All these birds on me, you could hear the chirp on me
I was cruisin' through the city in the G63, oh
Lookin' for somebody but I found it when I seen her
In the H-Town, my baby, you was D'up
Spotted me, was coolin' in my jewelry, I'm freeze up
Know you wanna fuck with me, what's up with ya?
The last thing I wanna hear is, "It's a dub with ya"
I know the people 'round you don't wanna see me with ya
But they don't give you dick and plus, I'm richer
I put my heart in your hands
Hopin' you'd hold me once again
How could you do the things you did?
Knowin' my heart burns for you like it did
You can come home

Always come back to me I could give at least ten fucks what a bitch say
In that LaFerrari doin' eighty while I switch lanes
I was waitin' on you down at 79 and Biscayne
I was fuckin' with you, now this shit is gettin' risky
You don't need no help from no one just to come and go forth
458, fallin' in it like a golf course
I just wanna love her, but she cost though
Can't believe she got me cuffed up like a cop though
I'm that nigga with the cash out, a forty stashed out
Girl, I came up from the trap house, I took the fast route
Spendin' nights all in the bando, I had to stand low
And when I get home, know I still dip in your shit commando
I'm at the spot, I got you teasin' and livin', reasonin'
Why I can't get up and leave it, I know I needed it
It beautiful, I plant a seed in it while I'm deep in it
Ain't no endin', every endin' feelin' like the beginnin' 
I could give at least ten fucks what a bitch say
In that LaFerrari doin' eighty while I switch lanes
I was waitin' on you down at 79 and Biscayne
I was fuckin' with you, now this shit is gettin' risky
How long did it take you?
Workin' night shifts 'til you made a breakthrough
Coppin' fly shit, now these bitches hate you 
Got your own whip, no nigga can play you
And you ride dick just like an animal
Back then, I never seen you dance before
Then I came in with some bands to blow
Now you say you never had a man before
And when that type of shit come out the bitch face
I could give ten fucks, I can tell the bitch fake
Judgin' off her Insta'
I just slid up in your girl DMs with the kiss face
Stupid-ass bitch, she try to put me on a mixtape
She won't get the number, she can hit me on Snap though
It won't make a difference when I hit it from the back though
If she bad enough, I hit it from the front 
Give a fuck what your boyfriend does 
I'm a real savage-ass nigga in some Chelsea boots
She want a nigga that can beat it when she tells him to
She probably tell you that's the reason that she fell for you
And I know because she tells me too
So I could give at least ten fucks what a bitch say
In that LaFerrari doin' eighty while I switch lanes
I was waitin' on you down at 79 and Biscayne
I was fuckin' with you, now this shit is gettin' risky

*Shots busting*
Part II
Me and the homie pull off the corner
Inside of a old Honda Accord
The feeling felt like a torture
The nigga that we just robbed just popped one in his shoulder
It led to me pulling over, to check him and tell him, dawg
Just take the passenger seat and I'll hit the road
'Cause it's way too many police out here to feel like we low
My back windshield broke and the driver seat soaked
From the blood that was previously leaking from his coat
We switch sides while I put this shit to drive
At 80 some odd miles, I'm shiftin the gear to 5
Hopin' that them 5-0 pigs don't see the ride
'Cause normally I ain't scared, tonight it's fear in my eyes
My phone blingin' 'cause my girl at home clingin'
And unaware of the problem this night on the road bringin'
Then I pick up the phone and tell her I'm speedin' home
As soon as I drop my dawg at the emergency roomYou got ya mind rocked, rollin' down Loners Blvd
You've got dreams, keep on dreaming
High school team, never got accepted
Guess it didn't get to go how I expected
Now a nigga pissed
Steady lookin' at the bottom of the list like
"Where the fuck are my projections?"
Niggas like, "Next year Tory
It's all good, you'll be next year's story"
Then I said "Man, you don't even understand
Man, I'm droppin' out now, win it next year for me"
So I left, bus route to the bench down 53
Took the last dollar that I had for this dream
And I spent it on some 99 cents Micky D's
Shit wasn't doin' too fine
Then I made a call to this nigga named Rimes
Said he had a little studio and it wasn't top-notch
But could damn near do the whole nine
So I said "Cool," made a few songs in this shit
Stayed too long in this shit
But by the month, man, I was there so much niggas had to lay futons in this shit
Owe it to my aunt Suzanne
Drove to my first shows in your new Jetta
Always said one day I would be the man
I would just laugh like, "Who are you tellin', me?"
I'ma go far
I could still dream in this world full of stars
I could still scheme in this world full of narcs
If they could still scheme in them unmarked cars, so
I'ma dream, I'ma dream, dream
I'ma dream, dream like you said to me
Best words that was said to me
Best words that was said to me
Ten long miles, from a long way home
I'm headed downtown 'cause I'm workin' on this lil' mixtape
No fillers, no throwaway songs
Hopin' that this shit just go
Sadly for me, this shit didn't
So I make another mixtape and another mixtape and another mixtape
'Til them niggas start sayin' shit's hittin'
Then I meet a guy named Sascha
Tells me he's thinkin' 'bout takin' up management
Say he got a million dollar empire on his mind, he just need the artist to plan it with
He also say he throw shows out in Texas and maybe I should open up for one
And I say "Cool man," he books me the next flight out like I'm showin' up for somethin'
I land down in Houston around nine, warehouse live
Was my worst show ever
Niggas damn near got booed off stage
I performed like my first show ever
Women in the crowd wouldn't scream for a nigga
Niggas in the crowd they was kotched up down
Bad enough niggas let Bun B watch
But I felt like I let Sascha down, this shit was live on stage, dog
That night felt like a nigga had the whole world on my shoulders
Twenty years old tryna find a warm spot in this world gettin' colder
Then he came to me like, "Dog, I could put money on this, bet a hundred on this"
Gives me a few tips for the next night setlist
Says, "Dog, you gon' run it on this" and it all works out
It's a big world
The bigger your dream, the bigger you're livin' it
It's all in your mind
Don't let nobody fuck up your high
It's a big world
The bigger your dream, the bigger you're livin' it
It's all in your mind
Don't let nobody fuck up your high
Father, I lift up my son, I lift up anyone that travels with him and by his speed I pray that you go ahead of him...I assign angels right now to this assignment and I declare Father that they will go before you to make straight his path, I command that every crooked path would be made straight, every rough place would be made smooth, every obstacle, every barricade, every blockade, every conspiracy, every trap, right now is destroyed and removed out of his way in the name of Jesus. And I thank you that it is written that goodness and love and mercy, form all the things of our life...Promises
You give me some more promises
You give me some more promises
Give it some more promises
Promise, give you promises
You give me some more
Let me know now
Let me, let me know now
When this drink and this potion give me international high
Will you sit on my passenger side?
I don't want no one else, no one else
I don’t need nobody, kissed you in my lobby
I met you inside, just all in my lobby
Drink inside of my hand
Shame all in my game
I just know I can't
Reason why I just can't, you know why I can’t
And everything you do can't be the reason why
But I only want you for me, I'm selfish, babe
Thoughts of you block out my memory
Oh, and if I could I would, if I could help it
But I can't help it, no
Drop my pin, share location with nobody else but you, baby
You know I go loco in it, I know what you need
I promise that these promises'll be what you believe
You'll hear what you need, yeah
I need way too much of you for me
And it makes me act superficial over you, oh
It's not you, it's just the things you do
Oh, yeah, yeah
I need way too much of you for me
And it makes me act superficial over you, oh
It’s not you, it’s just the things you do
Oh, yeah, yeah
I need way too much of you for me
And it makes me act superficial over you, oh
It's not you, it’s just the things you do
Oh, yeah, yeah
Let me know now
Let me, let me know nowSee, my days are cold without you 
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you 
See, my days are cold without you 
But I'm hurting while I'm with you 
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you 
Running, running back to you 
Running, running back to you 
You hurt me, you got me
Acting like I'm not me
I dig that, I'm big mad
The big bag, Versace
Oh, if you ain't love me like that
You wouldn't keep runnin' back
Oh, it's so hard to hold back
When you keep coming back, I'm glad, yeah
And when I need her back, I just put it on replay
Fly her to Miami, in the city where the Heat play
Had her in the sheets, finna cut her like a DJ
Fifteen bottles like a quince
She don't pay attention to that him say and she say
Said it two times, then I jinxed it
Saw right through me, had a cup full of lies as I drinked it, uh
Only gonna get it when she want it
New Givenchy, Birkin bag, girl, I was goin' in
Now you got some', baby, flaunt it
Wishin' I kept it honest
Oh, you got some, oh, you got some
Oh, you got somebody
But you won't stop frontin', you won't stop frontin'
You won't stop frontin' on it, babe
Oh, you got some, oh, you got some
Oh, you got somebody
But you won't stop frontin', you won't stop frontin'
You won't stop frontin' on it, babe 
See, when I get the strength to leave 
You, you can learn to appreciate me 
Then it all remains the same 
That you ain't never gonna change, never gonna change
You got me, I got you
You actin' out like you not you
The rumors, all not true 
You givin' away everything, I got you
Oh, Birkin bags and them tags won't get me back
I gave a fuck, you blow fifty stacks
You mad as fuck when I spit these facts
'Cause you can spend it ten ways 
Never cared about your money, regardless of what my friends say
'Cause there is nothing that they can say
Tory, if you really want it, you come Wednesday to Wednesday
Boss bitch whip, I pull up, cause a frenzy
No scratch on it, no Spud, no MacKenzie, uh
For all of my ladies, sing this song if you can't do wrong
Oh, you got some, oh, you got some
Oh, you got somebody 
But you won't stop frontin', you won't stop frontin'
You won't stop frontin' on it, babe 
Oh, you got some, oh, you got some 
Oh, you got somebody
But you won't stop frontin', you won't stop frontin' 
You won't stop frontin' on it, babe 
See, when I get the strength to leave 
You always tell me that you need me 
And I'm weak 'cause I believe you 
And I'm mad because I love you 
So I stop and think that maybe 
You can learn to appreciate me 
Then it all remains the same 
That you ain't never gonna change, never gonna change
Draft you to the team like Kobe in '96
Blue and orange drops like Ewing signed to the Knicks
You fine and you thick, get you assigned to the dick
Have you runnin' back and forth like suicides in this bitch
Do or dies in this bitch, like shoot from line in this bitch
I stunt so hard, I stuff credit cards in Goyards
Your face, no flaws, no case, no charge
Pulled up in BMs, we spendin' daily per diems
From AM to the PM, you would hop inside my bed
Get it wetter than, what's that line? Uh
Spray 'em where you see 'em
That's why I'm payin' no attention to chicks, I'm playin' in my DM
I know dropout Rovers, pop out sofas
Was with me when I wasn't eatin', we would pop out Stouffer's
You see, that's why I'm still fuckin' with you
Head down, ten toes, still thuggin' with you 
Takin' long flights out to DR
I'm still in Palos, back to Caicos
Trips for the chick that swing them hips like Miss Juegos
From questions like, "How'd your day go?"
I spend it, extended the suite another week
In Dego, just to watch the day go
As far as bankroll, bank go
I can speak for it with the trips like sprain on ankle
I keep mami on everyone of 'em, shit, I'm sonnin' 'em
Niggas talkin' crazy to bae, I point the gun at 'em
Super hell shit pop up, dun-dun-dun at 'em
Was with me back when I was broke, and so I run it up
Anything for you, I swerve in the lane for you
Hop in the drop top, still work in the rain for you
Nurture this pain for you
'Cause even days that it ain't workin'
I'm still lurkin' and hurtin', in pain for you
See the art was I was shootin' from the heart
But what's shootin' from the heart with a worthless aim for you?

All of a sudden, you say you hear my heart
Knowin' it's lies, baby, I see in your eyes, baby
You cheatin' me, I know you seen this shit from the start
Was lovin' you hard, I see the love come with scars
But I can hear your heart, it's crying out for me
And if it tears apart, take my worst flaws, that's on it
You should have never doubted
Now you can't live without me
You should have never doubted
Now you can't live without me
Mario
I see the way you lookin' like that 
Ain't no need to hold it back 
I'ma be the one to listen
Take you higher than you ever been
Baby, don't make me wait for nothin'
'Cause, girl, I promise you gon' love it
When you wet, you can't say you don't want it 
Every girl, that's a hit, I can have that 
But what's between me and you, we can't hide that 
You too bad to be playin', this a hijack
'Cause I can, I can hear you callin'
I can hear your heart , it's crying out 
I can hear your heart  and it's crying out
I can hear your heart  and it's crying out 
It's crying out for me, yeah

It's crying out for me 
And if it tears apart 
Take my words for how they soundin'
You should have never doubted 
Now you can't live without me 
You should have never doubted 
Now you can't live without me 
Baby, I won't lie to myself 
And you can't deny what you felt 
I know you miss ridin' with me, top down
Everywhere around town, now you're crying out for me
'Cause I hit it right, the way you like that 
You made your mind, I changed it right back, yeah
If you could do better , you would do better 
You know I'm sexy, intelligent or whatever 
Whoa 
Whoa 
Why? 
Why?
Whoa 
Whoa 
Why?
You wanted new shoes and a Bimmer
Back in the day, we were the two that would team up
Martin and Gina
You know the truth, but you seen a few, how you doin'?
I see your point of view when I need to
I won't lose sleep over this, no
Got me jumpin' out the window, fourty-fifth floor
Moods that you get me, babe
Things that I did to you, this is you gettin' me back
And I need more to love you
I've been prayin' that some peace gonna come through
How you gon' be my enemy when I love you?
You know I need your energy when you come through
You knew I found love when I seen you
Seein' you was somethin' that I ain't never seen before
But I seen the beach shore, you was all aboard my marina
Demeanor, scale of one to ten, 15
Shawty got game, front row, full season
Fuck with a nigga head, no good reason
Dress real spiffy anytime, it's pool season
Shawty get a kick outta fuckin' 'em and leavin'
You want a nigga that  appreciate ya
Have him rollin', then you go and put your skates on
I love you more than he could ever love you
Appreciate a nigga make we wanna do somethin'
And every time I hear your heart
Girl, I'ma show you what you came back to me forGot love for everyone in the business
But everyone in my business
Tell me, how should I talk when everyone is a witness?
And every slur out your mouth can turn into someone's sentence
That turn into somethin' later, that turn into somethin' vicious
And vicious niggas is after yo' time, turnin' yo' switches
Your friends swervin' yo' bitches and then burnin' your bridges
You stuck and severed in thoughts of when it's all gonna end
When the еnding's harder than thoughts
Or when it starts, it begins
Nobody wins whеn the family feud
Or when the family news turns into somethin' that no one from the family choose
Or when you plan to choose it, it's a dub for the feat
When they play they move
When the plans change and you plan to expand, pannin' the views
And these R&B singer women you called, all your friends choose
Kehlani hops on the news like it was somethin' to prove
Like me and her wasn't cool when I been friends with you for six years
Plus, plus the crew and we can Google picture proof
Got my phone number too, you coulda called me
But you movin' like we ain't even crew, and you'd not rather hear my views?
We used to phone talk late about exes and all our pools
I held your newborn in my arms, tell me how we aren't cool
Instead, you went to Twitter Shade Room to focus on your views
You was the quickest one to take me off records and set the mood
And now you got these little garbage artists talkin' like they takin' me off somethin'
That's gon' harm me, your label paid me already, dude
But KK, back to you, let me tell you who's
How to move, this is what you do
If you wanna take that stance, then that's cool
But we gon' do this with some rules
Ayy, JoJo, I need you to take notes too
Don't take me off the deluxe album that no one gives a fuck about
Take me off the original too
'Cause when I'm scrollin' through this Spotify playlist
See me my name both in y'all top five pages
It just feels a little unsincere, hmm?
Or maybe I refuse, am I trippin' and confused?
Y'all could have took me off the album but have still have yet to do?
Ayy, nah, maybe it's the truth
Got the numbers and the proof
'Cause with both of y'all combined, I gave y'all forty million views
Y'all can't lose
What do you do when your friends lookin' at you sideways?
I can't even tell 'em what happened because of my case
You can't even trust in nobody 'cause they might try face
All the G's tellin' you, OG, this isn't my day
Y'all can dub and hurt me but I'm fueled by a God
Tender love and mercy, devil tryna work me
But I pop up in the scene, chocolate car, color Hershey
It's some niggas that I lent money to that never imbursed me
I had many visions of this time, made decisions for the prime
Future thinkin' how I'm speakin' on the past like, "What a time"
Once upon a time, was just a kid that loved to rhyme
And now the fame is bittersweet, I take the cake that come with mine, Tory
Is it worth it?
When everything that's bittersweet isn't perfect
Lookin' beyond the surface
And I can see the greatest go away
I never meant to break your heart
I never meant to break your heart, no
Look
I know I'm swingin' with the excalibur sword, calibers in the drawer
Copped me a brand new Cullinan, calendars lookin' for him
My balance fully attended, two talents full on the floor
My palace is full of awards, my shower is like the Falls
I'm serious
And my aim is never beef with my peers
When niggas careers like the game with the seat with the chairs
When the music goes off and you left sittin', seein' who's there
Yeah, niggas don't even compare
It hurt to say them words 'bout Roc Nation management
'Cause Jigga whole career, I've been a fan of it
And I'm just pissed 'bout how these niggas handled it
I worked for this for years
And outta nowhere, here comes Jill tryna come smear campaign and damage it
Like she hit me with the "Oh, well"
But I know this so well
I'm colder than a polar bear's toenail in my hotel
Got thick strippers gettin' motorboated in a motel
Made videos and TMZ'll pay me just to go sell
I don't like to do this, y'all just act like I ain't human
Been two months and seein' me on memes and I ain't suppose to do shit?
Oh, I get it, y'all think I'm stupid
I'm supposed to lose to these lies
Tellin' rumor and sellin' niggas that feudin'
And talkin' to GOAT, never with they chest but all with they throat
It's like you can only trust these niggas as far as you throw
As far as it goes, the check, cards in the wallet
Console still got these bitches tryna swallow me whole
You know me
Shawty said I can't be canceled 'cause I'm far too handsome
I hopped up out that yellow Lamb', her man start a tantrum
The bands fallin' over me just like a starvin' dancer
But take that up with the man who decide to harness answers
I know God got me, I know God got me
The car frame in two lanes, it's a wide body
She'd rather fuck me in her brain but try to side eye me
Them Flower City niggas with me, homie, why try me?
Crack the seal on the weed, still on the speed
Watch critics create meme with zero chill on my feed
They never expected me to react actually
But fuck it, that's that nigga, I'm back to bein' me
But I wonder if we'll talk again
Wonder if we'll run up on Runyon Canyon at 9 o'clock at night and take that walk again
Even if you don't, I still consider you my friend
And the greater that it came, is still the bigger that it is
In my darkest days, sittin' at the pillar countin' scrilla
Chinchilla jacket like Tony at the villa
Not only am I richer than these fuck ass rap niggas, I'm realer
And I'm down to put that work in until you feel him
Shotta had many visions of this time, made decisions for the prime
Future thinkin' how I'm speakin' on the past like, "What a time"
Once upon a time, was just a kid that loved to rhyme
Now the fame is bittersweet, I take the cake that come with mine, Tory
Is it worth it?
When everything that's bittersweet isn't perfect
Lookin' beyond the surface
And I can see the greatest flow away
I never meant to break your heart
I never meant to break your heart, no
Yo, why yuh come disrespect up mon?

Love me baby, love a nigga
Pullin' out the lot, stuntin' on a couple niggas
Only with a couple hittas
Only let a couple bitches cook up in this kitchen, nigga
Hit a lick with all my young niggas, now my whip is Kristi Yamaguchi
My wrist and my neck is on Burberry and now them niggas thinkin' that it's Gucci
Niggas talkin' at you loosely

And then we watched it all crash
Sent chills down my heart and my spine 
But I still want you to be mine
And if I underestimated anything you did for me, yeah
It's 'cause I didn't know, 'cause I didn't know, 'cause I didn't know
That love could feel this good
If I could rewind time, needa make you mine
You know if I could then I would, yeah-yeah-yeah 
You know I want you back, I want you back 
'Cause who gon' make me feel this way?
I want you back

Ooh-yeah

We felt the rush so fast
So fast that we could not last
Felt like someone took my cove 
You showed me the true meaning of real love
And if I underestimated anything you did for me, yeah
It's 'cause I didn't know, 'cause I didn't know, 'cause I didn't know
That love could feel this good

Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
I love you from a distance
It got me so persistent
I love you from a distance
It got me so persistent
My shorty had an abortion for me like three times
As hard is that to say that to y'all
I think it's much harder to keep it silent
I hide emotion behind a face that's devoted
To only winnin' this race and this pussy, money, and violence
How could I be so selfish and need this time for myself?
Needing time for your health to recover, I'm on some other
I'm out there sellin' soap to these fiends, hopin' for dough for myself
23 like is there hope for myself?
'Cause if I never have a kid again, I'll be pissed but I deserve it
I been cursed with all these man-made ways
In this earth that I been livin' in
Sorry for the present problems that I put you on and get you in
Father God, take my soul if I can't play my role
'Cause I know what I'm doin', it ain't right, it ain't wrong but
In mid decisions, takin' life just ain't the way of life
'Cause day and night, I pray to Christ
In all hopes that you'll forgive me, shawty
Question is, can you forgive, baby? 
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
I love you from a distance
It becomes so persistent
I love you from a distance
It becomes so persistent
Hopped off the phone with my dad, niggas barely do speak
But I'm sending Western Union wires every two weeks
I got a brand new brother and sister I never do see
He might call to send me a blessing and tell me do me
But shit, I been doin' me since 14
Four court cases, court scene, four courses caught clean
Corner boy fortune, unfortunate dope fiends
That got a nigga cuffed in the court with these lawyer fees
And I just felt the game callin' me "A"
Felt like Mitch in Paid in Full
In a world that's gon' pay me full
Dropped out of school, them teachers just called me "fool"
Packed the black bag up, I'm back on my bull
You always told me these problems would soon catch up to me
And shit is catchin' up and fuckin' me up
Fourth quarter hustlin', I'm 'bout to sell a three up
If the Ds come, I'm gone
Pop, please forgive me for this song, gotta understand
Question is, can you forgive, baby?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
I really contemplated killin' you
Grippin' and cluthin' on side this pistol in my hand
Used to be my fam, dawg, you used to be my man
Solely out respect for your mom, I say your name, but I can't, look
Niggas would say they love and wanna kill you
This feeling's feelin' familiar, I felt it for way too long
Feelin' like the feelin' you felt was just way too strong
It felt like jealousy was just weighin' in on your dome
Should've cut ties, man I should've cut ties
Lord please, Lord please forgive my young eyes
I was young and unwise, I was just so naive
I was tryin' just believe, I was tryin' just perceive
But them niggas, they was greed, they was livin' outta greed
Now I'm livin' out a dream, cookin' kitchen outta steam
And you gotta feel me
Yacht master on a yacht looking filthy
That's why they do not feel me
You dig?
Question is, can you forgive, baby?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
I love you from a distance
It becomes so persistent

Out the trenches tryna slide, tryna get it and I'm winnin' so I swear I never lied
Kiss you on your neck, say, "Everything is great"
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facin' eight
Can't believe she played the witness tryna make them statements
Grace of God, you know the truth, so I'm gon' beat them cases
I would never put my hands on a woman, dawg
I would never let it blam on a woman, dawg
'Cause if you know me, then you know just how I'm comin', dawg
'Cause I done worked to hard to throw this out for anyone of y'all
I came from seein' niggas on sight
Back to back Backwoods on them long nights
Even when my niggas wrong, say they alright
If they gon' lock me up because she lyin' then
Make sure my kid is alright, make sure my chick is alright
And make sure y'all sell these niggas
All my written records that I did in case we face them long nights
In case we face them hard nights, like these
She the only chick I fucked that ever did me this low
But, baby, out of code, I don't bend, break or fold
I know God got me, I ain't trippin' off these hoes
Niggas show they colors now I'm only with the bros

He nearly fell up out the window, had to hold his shirt, woah

Got this .30 and my young nigga 'bout it, yeah
Put that on my mama, I won't die no fuck nigga
When you start get commas, that's when they want fuck with you
When you starvin', who gon' come pick that re-up with you?
Niggas left you out for dead and never stuck with you
You had to feed the family, that's a first
Make them pussy niggas understand ya, that's a first
Rich and switch, 20 bands for a verse
Rich and switch, 20 bands for a course
I can't let no fuck niggas 'round me
But I'm 'bout it like these young niggas 'round me, yeah
Liberace steady drippin' off my wrist
Slip in Versace, then I mix it with the kitchen
I lost my conscious day I fucked up with them chickens
A lot of bread that we done fucked off on these bitches
I know it's wrong, I know it's wrong, I know I'm selfish
I see that Fendi, see Chanel and I can't help it
Got all this pain and I'm just tryna dodge the devil
We shot Diego then they gave Speedy double
It hurt my heart when niggas immigrated Karo
He down to let them bitches fly, no Furtado
He down to let them bitches sing, no vibrato
He gon' let them bitches
I got the liquor, the pour up, and shawty she got all the dope I could roll with
We run the city and I get the money from all the bitches I roll with
Hop in the Phantom, I hop in the Phantom

For life, nigga—Don't gotta do that
And Don Q together
Who’s that?
Yeah, yeah, because they was—they…
Who's that?
Yo, we only doin' this shit once
It get real frightening, you know?
I get real disrespectful when niggas get neglectful of what we do over here
Highbridge stand the fuck up, yeah
Canada!
Uh, live from the DM, I’m hollerin' at your BM
We discussin' which color casket you 'bout to leave in
I did this shit for no reason, I'm lettin' rookies battle
But how did I get in this battle with A Boogie's shadow?
Big Apple, New York City, more to pity
How could I beef with a dude only poppin' in four cities?
I made Forbes with Diddys and sat top floors with 50s
And now I’m fully open, I play the bully on ’em
Call for your squad, your rescue get decimated
You lookin' like a Styles P nephew that never made it
Forever hated on niggas like Boogie and me
’Cause we was poppin' in New York and every hood that you see
The day you beat me will be the day you see see
HOT 97 feedin' you more lovin' than they feed me
Don’t let these niggas gas you on that podcast and CC
Highbridge, the Label, but only one of y'all on TV
Only one of y'all'll see awards and eat with the stars
It ain't really hard to figure out who I'm speakin' up for
Now that my foot and knee in the door, let's talk about it, no walkin' out it
We 'bout to see Le'Quincy body with the chalk around it
I got the full baggage
You drive a Jeep Wrangler, the basic edition, shit ain't even the full package
Someone tell Quincy I turn beef into mince meat
Hottest of the century, why did he go up against me?
I show niggas love and hatred niggas wanna throw back
He tempted me but never had this energy for Kodak
You paid DreamDoll for a feature to get the pussy
And somehow you think you fuckin' with me
The first night I seen DreamDoll I fucked her for free
And now you walk around like somehow you got one up on me
Nigga please, this your brother part
This nigga found Soulja Boy's Gucci headband and wore it in his cover art
Why battle with A Boogie's shadow?
Why battle with A Boogie's shadow?
He ain't even a chapter, he ain't even a factor
QP and Bubba touchin' way more money than him, they ain't even the rappers
It hurts when you kill a nigga you love
Ironic that the salt thrown from the niggas that's slugs
Chewin' these niggas with no ingestion
I got a real message for my brother Quincy, my nigga, it's time to go get tested
It's a couple hoes in Starlets I know you infected
You really out here fuckin' raw with a scrotum infection
And what's worse is you know it, still you go unprotected
You need to focus on a hit, need to go get a record
See you can find a Don Q in the ho nigga section
Go get injected with whatever medicine you need to clear up
'Cause them pills ain't workin' for every time it flare up
Yuck, I'ma let you breathe on that
I'm really beggin' that you think about your physical health
You'll never see your fuckin' album on a physical shelf
I'll beat your ass, whip your kid with the belt
You never flipped it to sell
You're not a hustler, your daddy was a customer
I got the info from your baby mama playin' nympho
You drive a foreign but them 25 hundred dollar hosts ain't enough for you to pay those rentals
You a shameless mental, well my aim is mental, fuck it
My whole mood I showed y'all fuck it
My dick, I done told y'all suck it
I'll punch your fat ass in your stomach
And make everything in it go up it
You wrote a tape for your nigga that died
You made a promise it would pop and that the shit would be live
Hurts that you had to tell my nigga a lie
'Cause that mixtape flopped and so did your other five
Put the gun aside, my nigga, you ain't the one to shoot
Big guns, nigga, you got locked for a .22
Pussy gotta keep a gun on his waist
'Cause you lil' niggas scared to get punched in your face
Jada said it best, Quincy made his bed to rest
Invest in a better vest
Better for my case, these bullets rather hit your head than chest
Quit actin' like you the mob
You tryna play Gianni
But you got ran out of Amazura and Avianne
The Bridge is over, The Bridge is over
I got an extra long clip that'll hit your soldiers
My hand shoot like shampoo hit his head and shoulders
I'll send his nine year old a Barbie just to send condolence
Uh, not the money on the head
40 minutes on stage can put a hundred on his head
I made so much millis and hundreds of this bread
I can have the whole Highbridge comin' for his head
Top floor, Glock's stocked in the top drawer by the 38
Bound to bring Le'Quincy Anderson up to the pearly gates
Your daughter just came from turnin' eight
And takin' L's right in front of her is what you tryna perpetrate?
All this blood make me regurgitate
Don't let my Bronx niggas move and have to boost up the murder rate
But since we're goin' here, I'll let you know I'm here
'Cause this record right here's 'bout to give you more shine than A Boogie ever gave you in your whole career
I spit fire, you from the eastside of the Bronx, you just a Highbridge dick-rider
You mad at my nigga Mula 'cause his shit hotter
I know how it feels
Nah, I'm lyin', I don't know how it feels
I just know that everywhere I go a nigga know I'm s'posed to be real
And I don't know how exposin' me feel, fuck nigga
Just to keep it real, I'm only doin' this shit with you once
You know, I… I hope, I hope you enjoyed this shit though
I hope, I hope you take this as a blessing, you know?
This, this is a lot of pay-per-view time you're gettin' right now
I know you not used to this, you a little frightened
But it's okay, my son, you know I still fuck with you, nigga
And you know, I mean, at least off of this, at least the celebrities might know your name now, you know?
Like… I hope I did that for you
Oh, in other words too, you wild ugly, nigga

They ain't scared about just a regular Black man in America, yeah, they fear that nigga too
But they fear the independent man
They fear the nigga who goes out and gets his
They fear the nigga that goes out and says, "I ain't takin' no for an answer"
They fear the man that says, "I'ma do it, I'ma make the corporation"
They fear the man that thinks above the employee position
They fear the man that wants to be a boss
They fear the Black man in America who's accomplished
When you step outside, when you're in that Benz, when you're in that Bentley
And you shine and you got your ice and your jewelry on
They fear you, nigga
Niggas gotta be stupid to not see what's goin' on out here
They tryna black out every single successful Black man in America
If bein' Black is bein culture, what's the cancel culture?
Sound like some white shit them niggas planted on us
The cops killin' only heroes on the cam recorders
When major corporations ramblin' 'bout niggas on Twitter
When all they did was put BLM in they handles for us
Open your eyes, they ain't standin' for us
It's 2020, been a year, God planned it for us
A lot of things he got planning for us
I'm in the ring like Rocky
I got a shot type Aki, but it'll steal a score
What's everybody in they feelings for?
It's 'cause I'm aimin' at the ceilin' floor
Still poppin' on these niggas, waitin' while they slither
When I'm comin', they can feel it more
The blogs only want my words just to switch 'em more
What do you do when the court lawyers is tellin' you not to talk
And as soon you don't, you playin' the villain for it?
You got a lot of feelings still in store
I'm still hearin' stories, that nigga talkin' 'bout Tory is over
I'm God's child, I'm one of his most glorious soldiers
I'm workin' at the old man's, custodian, quota
I'm notorious for the stories of overcomin' the poorest of situations and comin' out glorious from 'em
Niggas taught us to sell dope when you bored in the summer
He was lackin' a couple cast, then got caught in the summer
Pulled up on him, they started clappin' his dome in the summer, no wonder
That was my dawg, I used to fuck with him hard
He pull up to the tour bus with the dawgs
He used to tell me I'm a Don and I'm a prince and how I come with the charm
And laughed back and say, "Don't fuck with no frauds"
'Lil cuz, you a star
Take me to the back, bust a cigar
Told me rap and stop hustlin' raw, but I was doublin' hard
Next step, cop comin' in car and you was always there to bust up a charge
Shit just fucked with me hard
Now it's pannin' out, news cameras standin' out
Wrongfully accused but on the news is what the man about
Even my own friends hands wasn't out
Tell me, what that's all about?
Fame got us fallin' out
Niggas hated on me, made me grind harder
It's gon' be people that gon' switch when the times harder
The door's open for a short line of niggas and it figures
It's the time, I ain't tryna make my line longer
I made my mind stronger
I made my heart colder
I work the best when my back was up at the wall for ya
I'm goin' through some changes, close friends turn to strangers
I'm tryna turn the pages even though it's anger in my heart for ya
Yeah, more important than ever
The snow is fallin' on my brain in the coldest December
I tell a lie like, "Yo, I'm fine," but I'm holdin' together
I'm back on pace for the race
I'm at a rate where niggas just start blowin' this cheddar so damn hard that I part ways
With both of my hoes and had 'em both trippin' out and goin' together
For all the ones that know me better, you know I'm fed up
The only way to hold a set up is to know a set up
I don't like to do this, y'all just act like I ain’t human
Please don't listen to the rumors that they try alludin'
I've never hit no woman, why the fuck would I just do this?
This be that dark label shit, them niggas tryna do me
I know the secrets and I know the fuckery
And they don't want me to say nothin' so they tryna shut— 
But God the only one in line to judge me
The other side and kind is ugly and they tryna fuck me, yeah
What happened to the times of helpin' self?
When we dehumanizin' celebrities with mental health
Don't know the story, so we make one and upset ourselves
So nowadays, I feel the pain from certain niggas I ain't never felt
We just marched in unity about us bein' brothers
And y'all ain't even hear my side, that's how we bein' brothers?
It's kinda crazy, white folks ain't even sayin' nothin'
Only celebs I'm seein' hatin' are my same color
Get it together, we gotta get it together
My nigga, we Black skin and we gotta live it together
Fuck how you feelin' about me, we got a mission together
You gotta listen, 'cause God, he gotta get his endeavor, preach
Tory, you in this situation, not because he's hatin'
He's usin' Megan as a vessel and a test of faith and
Even when you at the bottom, it's when he makes his way in
God, thank you for turnin' me into a demonstrationSet It Off

When Grandma kicked me out the crib, I was only a baby
Said fuck it, I hustled and went and bought me a Mercedes

So much lies to the people, they started not to defend me
The ballers, the rappers, singers, niggas with Emmys
Got me thinkin' from the start, they was holdin' some hidden envy
My peers that get offended, I love you but I meant it
Once upon a time, we had this thing called friendship
Instead y'all betrayed me, talk loud in your mentions
You laughed at my pain and only at my expenses
You wеnt from, "That's my brother for life. Quarantine, Quarantinе"
To now y'all just showin' me what bein' alone means
I don't hold it against you, you see me, it's love
You know I know what it is 'cause I know what it was
This is what fame 'bout, clickbaitin' the clout
Believin' one side of the story 'fore the other side come out
When your most firm believers are all startin' to doubt
Die for your soul before they kill you for cloutCashMoneyAP

Lil Tory 
Told my bitch, "I love her", she ain't say it back
My heart, I can't play with that
Fuck it, that's that, and we made it that
Runnin' through the trap to find my re-up, tryna make it back
BM trippin', I'm just tryna cop my son his favorite snacks
Love from the Crip, Bloods, and GDs
Scammin' out the bank, I made like fifty thou' on TD
In this trap, my homeboys my heart, but shit, I gotta move greedy
Got a budget for the lawyer case I lose with this PD 
'Cause we tryna get more than rich, fuck the fame and all the glitz
My bitch ain't had tits, so I bought her tits
I'm a lil' older, so I mold her 'til I taught the bitch
Boy, I woulda swore that she was loyal 'til I caught the bitch
I won't trust a soul, it's just me and my pole, playin' position
On that road, watchin' jackboys close
Gun closer than the sirens, see if them boys try me
Bitch, I'm openin' the fire, catchin' bodies like corona in the virus, nigga
Weed bought the Rolex, crack bought the bussdown
Trappin' did a home run, scammin' did a touchdown
Thinkin' 'bout my son now, know I gotta stay alive
'Cause I done let him down like four times and I can't make it five
Cops from a naked eye, watchin' in a foreign
But we movin' neat, the DA can't grant them no warrants 
The Birdman with me like Wayne in New Orleans
Rainin' and pourin', ragin' and warin'
Prolly lost my bitch to an athlete
Fuck it, I'ma pull up with another bitch, mad fleek
I remember Crystal done told me I was mad weak
From that day, I never let another bitch embarrass me 
I had to wear the same drawers
Goin' out for weeks, a nigga stank, but this shit paid off
Flexin' like I own the rental, nigga, I had to play it off
Hoes I put this dick off in they hole just like I'm playin' golf
Anytime I ran up out of work I sold 'em drywall
I was broke and threw it on the scale 'cause I can't eyeball
Homie, I just came from bein' homeless, that's a sidebar
That's why with this rap shit I be focused, can't take time off
Boy, I'm not a killer, but don't push me, that's on my mama
'Cause my killers out there swimmin' in the deep end
'Fore he knew that nigga drowned 'cause he was deep in
Scoreboard, bitch, you playin' on the defense
My lil' niggas catchin' bodies every weekend
My lil' shooter made the movie with the sequence
Play with us and we gon' turn that nigga pretense
In the foreign, picked him up from out the precinct
'Cause he gon' still put in that pressure 'til the beef ends, ayy
I wanna cheat but I'll prolly kill her if she cheat on me
Homicidal thoughts don't mix with Gs on me
Plus I be with Gs, homie, stick hot like ninety-eight degrees on me
Trigger finger itchy like some fleas on me
Sleepin' on my nigga sofa, sleepin' on the floor
I couldn't even tell a bitch, "Come over"
Now it's all Dior all on my body like my melatonin
Niggas took the stand, I can't believe them boys were tellin' on me
Street shit is hella phony, yeah
Look in my eyes, you see I'm dodgin' all the demons
Came a long way from swipin' fraud cards at all the Neiman's 
I was plottin' and schemin', poppin' bad beans and shit
I thought it, then dreamed it, turned it to reality
This a fatality, killin' any nigga sayin' he got the same style as me
I'm the only rapper sayin' shit with no apology
Pull up, you could holler, B
Your favorite rapper's shit just ain't as hot as me
Tory

She told me that she love a trap nigga gettin' fly

You'll probably call me a busta by the end of this song
But I ain't gon' act like there wasn't a time when I wasn't that guy
And you treated me like a nigga that's just on the passenger side
You and girls were screamin' that y'all don't wan't no scrubs

Then I made a decision, I'm with it, it's written
When I catch you slippin', I'm gon' do you wrong
So I done came up now, I got my cake up now
But I cannot forget all the times you used to say to me
No, I don't want no scrubs, do you remember that?
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me, do you remember that?
Sittin' on the passenger side 'cause I remember that
Of his best friend's ride tryna holla at me, you and all your friends would say
No, I don't want no scrubs, do you remember that?
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me, do you remember that?
Sittin' on the passenger side 'cause I remember that

You see I was the nigga that was all on the side of his best friend's ride
See my pockets were thinner and my dollars were slimmer
When I asked for your digits, you simply replied, "No scrubs"
So I finally waited, I waited for you
Plottin' the way I'm gon' do it and waitin' for you to fall through
I pulled up on you in that rental but you thought that shit was my own
And that's when you came up and gave me your number, it's sick just to know
But I ain't playin' timid, it's guaranteed that we did it
The first night I came over, she had me in her room
And all that I'm thinkin' is look what a car can do
It got me gettin' you outside your pants and you used to say
No, I don't want no scrubs, do you remember that?
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me, do you remember that?
Sittin' on the passenger side 'cause I remember that
Of his best friend's ride tryna holla at me, you and all your friends would say
No, I don't want no scrubs, do you remember that?
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me, do you remember that?
Sittin' on the passenger side 'cause I remember that
Of his best friend's ride tryna holla at me, you and all your friends would say

I need a comfort that I am not talkin'
To one that sit back at the bed when I sleep on the road

You know we move through the city like general pimpin'
While women just creep on the low
Me? I’m just rollin', I’m hopin' my soon to be finished

Spending your nights the way you wanna 
And I know that you got no one that does you like I do
And who you got right now can't fuck you like I do
And you got that type that I seem to like
And it feels like I missed my chance, so let's dance one more time
'Cause you might think you need someone brand new
Don't front like I'm not fucked up over you
You lost so much to me, don't know the truth
I'm stressing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you

I'm stressing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you
I'm stressing, yеah, I'm fucked up over you
You, uh
You might just think that you need someonе new
I fell in love with the thought of something true
I pull my brakes and tried to play it cool
Infatuated, I waited for you
Yeah, holding on this stance, things I should've said
Thoughts racing in my head
You know what I did
Got nervous, so I fled
I left it where I left it, won't leave your side again

Lucille: Okay, I'll take youIf I die before I wake up, pray the Lord my soul to take
Repent for my sins and meet him at the golden gate
Lost some of my dawgs, so in my heart, man, it's this frozen place
Gotta watch for your soul, man, you could go today
Oh, my dawg, I'm finna meet you at them golden gates
We sat together like a pair of fucking roller skates
Ridin' around inside that Civic with the stolen plates
They got a nigga feeling colder than the frozen lakes
Fell on my knees with all the Gs, man, it ain't no complaints
Gotta keep it real, dawg, never would you squeal, dawg
Fuck the frenemies and the enemies, this was my real dawg
See, even if you six feet deep, my nigga, you're still squad
And I'm finna hold your place when I see your daughter face
I wish I could re-wrote all them dates and have some soldiers placed
Even if it was on my time, I'd make them hold they place
Lord knows I ain't condoning, but they be shooting like it's Golden State
I got so much pain in what I used to call a golden place
Sip my liquor straight, 'cause when I sip, man, I can't cope with chase
Man, I lost my dawg, I lost my squad, I lost my fam, dawg
How many streets that I'm thuggin' in, I tryna get bam, dawg
When you were scamming, dawg, you would the Lamb and floss
We was both abandoned, we was trapping out of bandis, dawg
Thought that he could scam it all, but they gave him a headshot
Know that when you livin' you gon' die by that red dot
Cops is like some fire ants, so we was ducking red hots
Twistin' on them blocks, had make us lock it like it was dreadlocks
And I miss my dawg, was fighting fed shots
I can't believe this life done brought you to a dead stop
We were fighting fed cases, counting up these dead faces
Talking about this money we finna invest, 'cause the next year was pacin'
Never had no scared face, you was 10 toes down
Right behind a nigga when I was down with 10 fours 'round
When them niggas surround you, see who's around you, that's how it goes down
You was in a cold town, they caught you when you was slowed down
Prayin' five times a day, just tryin' to spill my soul out
'Posed be with me on tour days, 'cause everything is sold out, nah, nah, nah
I wish I could stunt one more time wit' my nigga
Hit the corner, jump one more time wit' my nigga
Wish I could get it jumpin' one more time wit' my nigga
I think about you everyday, yeah, I gotchu
If I die before I wake up, pray the Lord my soul to take
Repent for my sins and meet him at the golden gate
Lost some of my dawgs, so in my heart, man, it's this frozen place
Gotta watch for your soul, man, you could go todayYou know I met her in Miami, that my baby
She know a young nigga ballin' just like McGrady
I'm tryna give her the keys to that Mercedes
I take her over the seas because I'm wavy
And we not really in love but we go crazy
Shawty I can't blame you, you can't blame me
Shawty I can't play you, you can't play me
'Cause you do your thing two, I do my thing three
Any way that you put it, look it's the same thing
Bitch I'm wavy, I done pulled up in a 'cedes
Pockets on young and rich, let a nigga hate me
I'ma young rich nigga, can't believe I made it
Man I came from Kraft dinner, eatin' KD
Sleeping on the floor mats in the basement
Life hit me hard and I had to face it
I could never tell you niggas what them days did
You was with a nigga through the time I wasted
Smoked up, drinked up, I was wasted
Fame on the way and I could nearly taste it
They left me for dead, I could never rate it
Hit the block with me, niggas with me, they did
I just came from the bottom and it's back to basics
Shawty held me down, now when I'm famous
I just wanna ball hard, I know where my lane is
I'm feeling sedated, you got me waitin'
Shawty you know you're fine
And yeah you know you remind me of a bad little baby
Touching and tasting, when I get you alone
I send tingles up your spine and baby you know I
'Fore I made it out the gutter I was dreaming
'Fore I made it out the gutter I was dreaming
You know she my baby 
I ain't bullshittin' 
Met her in Miami walking outta Fingalicking 
Half innocent, half Video vixen 
Low mileage pussy, she want commitment 
I don't know too much about love
Ay, I'm from Memphis where your girlfriend and best friend are witness and co-defendant 
Shit crazy, the world that we live in 
Snitches still livin' while real niggas get sentenced
They love me for dead, I point out the hating 
Fast forward things, blues bustin' out the jean 
I bet on myself first, now I'm all in 
Will you be my b-a-b-y? 
All them hoes man and I see why 
I was switching planes, mid lanes of the G5 
Good in any hood from the south to the east side Can't nobody stop me
Can't nobody stop me
Yeah, I'll never let y'all niggas stop me
Look
We just lost Chadwick Boseman to cancer, colon
2020 quarantine, who know the plan his hand was holdin'?
The Black man stand for culture
The white man gave us cancel culture
And God bless the man you lay your hands up over
You gave me the keys, but see, the devil's like a tenet that won't hand 'em over
Angels still protect the neck, I laid and slang it over
Niggas ramble just to cancel Tory, they say my plan is over
God's plan can't bе over when the flow is still cold
As a man stuck in thе snow with his hands fold out in Manitoba
Camera catchin' still, stashin' numbers in my cannon holder
Tony Danza stance, still poppin' out the candy rover
Two sides to everythin', we bandin' over
What is all the slander over?
Oh, let's deport Tory for a story we don't know
But still got our necks out and hands up over
On my feed and timeline, there's niggas throwin' temper tantrums on 'em
Me, I just handle all 'em
Cut and throw a bandage on 'em
Stars playin' games, but Tory's never ashamed
'Cause if I did what they sayin', I'd probably would say the same
I would call me, "Bitch ass nigga," "Fuck boy" and everythin'
I just thought y'all hear my story before you thought I let that bang
But when the friends change, the story change
I just never thought that you would turn this to a Tory thing
I just never thought that you would turn this to a glory game
Once upon a time
My rap friends would never switch up they numbers on Tory Lanez
In the midst of the warrant things
I still ain't been convicted of shit, but they wanna bang
These the same niggas ridin' my dick on the Quarantine Radio
Crazy flow for my hoes that order name brand, poppin' imported things, I'm here
I refuse to be the poster boy for Black women unprotected
My mama Black, my sister Black
My baby mama Black, so how the fuck I'm unaffected?
Black women fueled my whole career for years
So don't make me some type of tear and unperfection
Love every color, every shape, size, and section
So I never left no one rejected
Yeah, I'm not perfect when you cut me up in sections
I got blunt objections
But if you teach me, I can work with lessons
Plus I'm real ill, we can chill, light a Dutch and burn the herbal essence
Don't tear me down, just lift me up and help me learn them lessons
Help a nigga learn them blessings
Help me more to understand your real plan is worth the stresses
That's the way to learn protection
That's the way to learn progression
Take your man to therapy, check on his mental health before you burn aggression
None of us deserve depression
None of this is worth the stressin'
It's just drama mixed with the trauma of curve and rejection
I get stuck in some evil thoughts, need words of correction
I start movin' too fast, I start burnin' my blessings
I go to interviews, niggas talkin', I'm curvin' they questions
Turnin' they table, I'm in they face and they heard I was reppin'
I'm on top on the world 
And God got me, so I'm poppin' on top of yo' girl
Stop light stoppin' yo' girl
They thought this wouldn't stop me, I still hot as a churro
I'm still stayin' stronger than black hair locked in a curl
I'm on the block and I'm thorough
Because I'm strong and plus I'm focused and I am the coldest
And any rapper in my position under this much pressure would've told on his open case and folded
It's kinda hard to tell yo' all and not be quoted in the court of law, yeah
Can't nobody stop me
Can't nobody stop me, ohYeah, yeah
Wow, wow, ayy
Temperature's risin’
And I'm fantasizin' bout’ givin' it to you
Givin' you somethin'
Won't lie, it's somethin' I wanna do to you

Time to make you feel it for real
Temperature risin’ 
Makin' love slow 
Your body's callin' 
Rubbin' on me slow 
Got my attention 
Undivided 
I wanna love ya
This time, this time, I wanna love ya
Tonight it's a love makin' affair
Temperature's risin'
And I'm still fantasizin' 'bout what I wanna do to you
My body pressed against your body, baby 
I'm hittin' places that nobody can 
Lickin' your body
Lovin' as the sweat drip down, yeah
I'm tellin' you to lock the door
If we ain't sexin', what we in here for?
Temperature risin' 
Makin' love slow 
Your body's callin' 
Rubbin' on me slow 
Got my attention 
Undivided 
I wanna love ya 
Tonight it's a love makin' affair My mama always told me I would have the hits
She wasn't alive to see me have a hit
Had to make decisions, go and hit the road
That was back when Keisha nearly had a kid
Nigga, had to sell about a quarter ounce
Sold pop of front of somethin' like a whole ounce
He said, "Why you never get to see me at the crib?"
Step mama moved in, nigga, so I bounced
Real shit, if I had to sell a quarter water
Only thing I gotta do I get rent pay
Told the teachers, nigga, I'ma be a fuckin' rebel
Dropped out next week, that was 10th grade
Yeah, rich young nigga, I came up
Told you niggas I would get my change up
Put 7 8 9 10 chains up
Fuck the 'gram, this show me where I came from
Yeah, know we in the place
Hit the Ricky Bobby with the .40 on my waist
Gold grill shinin' like a Rollie in my face
I just hit a point like I'm Kobe with the play
Talkin' to the kid, dawg, niggas pissed off
But we came here after the plays lift off
Nigga, you are now talkin' to the kid, foo'
Lot of niggas talk the shit but they ain't really with the shit
For a rich nigga, rich nigga
All my niggas stars, when you see us
You are lookin' at a big dipper
Oh boy, oh God, let a nigga win, we gon' buy the whole store
One Umbrella, yeah
I told you niggas, I told you niggas
My mama always told me I would have the hits
She wasn't alive to see me have a hit
Had to make decisions, go and hit the road
Young black nigga stickin' to the code
Had a court case I done tossed that
Couple ex bitches I divorced that
I remember when I could not afford that
Couldn't even sign for it, had to forge that
Yeah, money on my mind, got the ambition and the grind
Hang a fuck nigga like he dryin'
One twelfth rhyme
'Bout to order steak with the fries
Used to eat the Maruchan chicken with the side, one time
Every nigga workin' in the trap
Pray to Lord, help you if you servin' with the strap
Wait, J., you know I deserve me a plaque
If it ain't comin' to me, nigga, I murder a track
I'm a rich young nigga from the 416
Same bitches hatin', they be on my dick
Every year boy, we real heavy over here, boy
I waited for my time, now the shit is finally here, boy
Finally here, boy
My niggas finally here, boy
All the shit up in a year, boy
Standin' right here boy
It's clear boy
When I step up in the airport, hold up, yeah
Wall to wall money, I done did it
Nigga, I'm the truth and I admit it
Contracts gettin' written, I'm the nigga
Air Jordan, my nation, Scottie Pippen
Killas on the payroll
They'll shoot it if I say so
2014, I ain't really for the beef
I just want the fuckin' peso
Yeah, and the cheese with the queso
100 Gs in the case, Lord
We was just some lil niggas last year
Playin' with them lil things off safe mode
Young nigga, had to get the money and the funds quicker
I don't wanna have niggas sleepin' on my shit
After a nigga dropped this one
Im talking his and hers beamers for me and my side bitches
Calvin Klein pictures in all my design scriptures
Made alot of money just spitting what’s flying richer
So nggas try and lay low just hope that they lie in ditches
Im killing these nggas
George Forman in the 6 how I'm grilling these niggas
Yall like to play games and say names never to me directly
Just someone connected next to me, yall ain't got the heart so you try and talk on the reg to me
Niggas steady claim that they got it
Tried to use my name in some product til I found out
Shit is crazy I made it, from the bottom and told the Dot that i got em
Some niggas just ain’t believe me, but shit they couldn’t see it like Stevie
With the keys, but he still played them
And Jesus ain’t start with believers, but he still made em
I had to make some change, I made my dollars then I made my name
I’m never letting this fame let me change
I’m courtside a couple Lakers games
I’m always in some block a hater frames
Or some, gold and you see wanna rob a players chains
These niggas is like Destiny’s Child tryna say my name
Its worth it, I lay your hearse with purpose
These niggas put me on the hook cause they scared of my verses
And I can kill your best written while spitting my worst shit
Young rich and gifted nigga my writtens in cursive, listen
Yall taking bout them high tone women glowing skin tint purses
Already got my iPhone 6 with the Sprint Service
At sixteen in a limosines with the tint service
2015 its hard not commit murder
When i pull up, hop out, bringing the backwood up
Niggas hated last year now they saying what up
You was not around when i was selling the cook up
Or roaming downtown without a home to hook up
Grandma basically told me to find a corner
Little did I know I’d be selling that marijauna
Little did I know it would turn into that Madonna
Little did I know I’d be selling right on Spadina
Little did I know I would roll into local diners, to try and find me a sandwich or something
Cause this hunger from my heart is moving down to my stomach
Shit I’m scarred, trying to find myself on this fucking boulevard

Fuck niggas talkin', my teachers called me a disgrace
Had to pull up on 'em last weekend in the big Wraith
I sold work on sick days and ripped Js
I spent days tryna duck the ricochets
'Cause we were tryna figure which clique played with the shooter
Nowadays you boys just tryna figure who click play
I made bitches and made niggas, y'all boys just bitch made niggas
I flip it like a swiss, switchblade, nigga
Fuck around with me, come run the town with me
I do it for my dogs and niggas that's down with me

I mean, I find it funny they give me the same bundle without spendin' money, they just give it to me, 'cause I'm poppin'
More honesty and less lies
Skirted the McLaren off the lot, shit, I bought it as a test drive
I took the jet for the fuckin' 110th time
Hoping that I don't go out like Aaliyah or a Left Eye
Shit, I'm the greatest, I'm the people's favorite
Thanks to God's graces, I been number one in all these peoples' faces
So amazing how I made it from the mazes and the phases change faces, but I'm back to being basic
How many years am I gon' spend being famous?
Actin' like I'm normal, like I don't realize I made it, like I don't realize I'm famous
Like I don't realize every time I walk around the city, they look at me like the greatest
All-time hated nigga, put me in your playlist
Trunk on the front of McLaren's that need a waitlist
So when I back, back, I'm frontin' on fuck niggas, that told me I'll never made it, in my Audemar Piguet wrist
I hop the plane in sweats and the Bathing Ape kicks, 50 pointer bracelets, man's best fragrance
I'm still ballin', these foul niggas is still flagrant
I ain't got no business talkin', just a bill statement
See the lights from a far away
I still feel close on the nights when I'm far away
I comin' home, workin' at nights to a hard day
Tryin' to avoid nights in the hallway sellin' hard ye
Back when you was hip-hoppin' and watchin' Kanye
I was coach hoppin' and sleepin' inside a Hyundai
Made bands out of any floor, at your mom place
Tryna duck the crime rate, where the fuck was my mindstate?
I cry real tears thinkin' bout my mom face
If she was here, I'm thinkin', what would my mom say?
She'd say, I'm well-accomplished, she'd say I really did it
She said don't let her settle for no penny pincher
I, will not lose, no, I refuse niggas
I, 2 plus 2 niggas, I school niggas
She wanna get high, fuck with a cool nigga
48 floors, check out my view nigga
Uh, I already know the outcome
I may have fucked it up with Nicki right before this album
My ex on me like Malcolm, she know we can't be together
But still be askin' me, "How come?" I know the shit crazy
My life upgraded and I ain't going backwards
Closest thing going backwards is me rollin' Backwoods
Lookin' at you niggas like there's no more factors
Until the story over like there's no more chapters

Uh, beautiful Black child, let's have a conversation
Let's skip the contemplation
Let's talk more about moderation and modern-day shit
Let's learn Black love, take it back by the basis
We ain't even gotta fake shit
Beautiful Black women, help me to make you stronger
Help me to make me stronger
Help though it takes me as long as clock on the wall to get my act right and make me call hеr
Help me to make you bеtter, help me, I'll take you farther
All these insecurities play on your mind currently
Dealt with pain durably
And here I come inside of the bathroom, makin' it worse, blamin' you for the pain hurtin' me
We need God urgently
Lately, I've been workin' your feelings while on my workin' spree
Lately, I've been hurtin' your feelings, meanwhile, it's hurtin' me
Maybe I've been all in my feelings, tryna get back to you
Lately, I've been mindin' my bidness, tryna get back at you
Help me more to understand, it's traumas in my past that make me talk loud and lash at you
Sorry for the times my attitude mix with the status too
We've been smokin' weed and gettin' drunk, and mixin' bad in too
Fuck all that status, I'm tryna get back the back with you
Beautiful Black mothers, you raised so many of us
They build abortion clinics by your house to take you from us
Beautiful Black fathers, I know your back against the wall
You goin' hard but don't you let these people take you from us
We thuggin' hard, niggas die in the summer
Who gon' supply for our sons? Who gon' supply for our daughters?
We can't leave it to section eight to provide like a father
We can't leave our kids with these people decidin' the order
Last time I checked, nigga, we was decidin' the culture
Last time I checked, nigga, that's what decided the order
Last time I checked, nigga, we was controllin' the trend
Same one that got white kids Tik-Tokin' and woah'ing again
People been stealin' from us in blind sight
White people payin' Black blogs to damage us and self-damage us on all online sites
Shade Room, y'all ain't hidin', twenty million followers
To Black folk, you gotta be more positive
Even though your investor's a white guy named Bryce Robins
Is it worth explorin' the Black culture for the measly a hunnid thousand dollars?
Look Angelica, it ain't worth it
You a Black queen that push your scene above the surface
And we love you for that active drive and purpose
But it's time you take that hunnid thou', reverse it
Work it back into our communities, rehabilitate the unity
Young Black women shinin', don't be confused by my lines
Before they up and tryna take 'em and reconfuse as some hatred, listen
My Black child, I'm sayin' this 'cause I love you
But love ain't come with the lessons that's gon' live life all above you
The police gon' hate up on you, the government's never for you
But you can rise all above it as long as you keep your lovin'
I say this just 'cause I care
And I care for you, for you
And I'm there for you, I'm there for you
And I care for you, for you
And I'm there for you, I'm there for you
I was never good in school but smart enough to see the signs
Behind the fuckery and lies of the system and how they try
The grand plan is to separate us, tear us down, conquer divide
The main plan was to have the Black man silenced
And though, of course, we used our voice to override it
They influenced us by usin' niggas our color to talk 'bout drugs and violence and signed 'em
They made Black women talk more sex and less what they mind is
'80s all through the the '90s, like who the fuck is behind this?
You awake to remind us, I equate to remind ya
Business, they told you mind ya, listen and you ain't find your
Self inside of this war, the devil dive in your door
My Black skinned, Christians, know the devil pry at your more
My beautiful Black daughters, the ones who lash out in class
Out of anger, that angle the fact they had no fuckin' fathers
Or the ones they had would touch they daughters
We never knew 'cause they was quiet in school
No one supports them and the affection only came from fuck niggas that love in portions
Or some older cats that never made love, to fuck they forced it
But it's the way that love was taught to you, shawty
Nobody taught it, you gotta know that ain't your fault
You tryna tear your mind comparin' yourself to someone who's brought up in family genes
That means mother, father is present on family tree
That mean you don't take all the blame 'cause they wasn't there
That just mean you a Black queen whose life wasn't fair
But God give unfair to the favorites
None heirs to the hatred
Tests that bring you faith when it's unclear what the fate is
People talk 'bout your untamed hair, hey, it's my favorite
Dark skin and light skin, and love you for what your shade is
It's Black
Unapologetic and Afrocentric
With enough curve and ass for me to not have to mention all of my afro-hension
With natural hair, you fierce, they told you had to have extentions
That was cappin' past the fiction
Shawty, you a whole ninth inning, championship, when you batting that shit up past the fences
You know I'm past attentive, let's make some last decisions
My Black child, I'm sayin' this 'cause I love you
But love ain't come with the lessons that's gon' live life all above you
The police gon' hate up on you, the government's never for you
But you can rise all above it as long as you keep your lovin'
I say this just 'cause I care
And I care for you, for you
And I'm there for you, I'm there for you
And I care for you, for you
And I'm there for you, I'm there for youYou see, the thing about it is, we used to be them lil' niggas
Now we just them niggas
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bendin' off the corner, whippin' out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But I ain't gon' lose when I came from the bottom
Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows

My new resolution is stay the fuck away from fuck niggas
Ain't even drivin' 'em back
She come with the team, then she's stuck with us
I might buy a foreign
I'm thinkin' the plate should say, "Nigga Keep Up With Us"
Niggas gon' hate but they know I'm big homie
Ain't gotta know nothin' to know that it's somethin'
Now droppin' the bass when they see the big homie, drop it
I'm flooded, they with it, bitch you can bet it for sure
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bendin' off the corner, whippin' out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But I ain't gon' lose when I came from the bottom
Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows
Nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows, nigga, Lord knows
I walk in the bank and the teller call me Mr. Peterson
The diamonds all up in my Rollie, tell her we gon' meet again
Any time that my baby catch me with a chick I say, "She a friend"
Ironic, I came to the club and my jacket was cheetah skin
All of the real niggas come from Toronto
Niggas'll send you away
Goin' OT to kill you, then come back tomorrow
Woah, this a dirty game in here
He'll be a dead man walkin'
If he ever wear 30 chains in here
I ain't talkin' 'bout French Montana
Have to worry 'bout everything in there
Man niggas tryna take my soul
Pray the Lord that I make my dough

Pull up in all the big bodies

All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bendin' off the corner, whippin' out the lot, I got it

So I did what I did for the night
Had to go, had to get, a couple chicks, get it right

But my flaws and my dogs
Got involved, so I think that it's time
That I say what's on my mind
I think we both cheated love
And I'm certain we both got it bad

Fucked around and 
One more time 
Cheated, then I 
Did it once again
(You got it, you got it bad
Hang up, then you call right back

But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else

When you say that you love me but you really don't
All that shit that you been talking', you ain't really on
Said it's time that I find someone new
And I'm tryin', but I keep on findin' you
And when I get the time, she always split my mind
Sippin' on this drank, how did we slip with time?
'Cause my flaws and my dogs
Got involved, so I think that it's time
That I say what's on my mind
I think we both cheated love
And I'm certain we both got it bad
Cheated, then I 
Fucked around and

Cheated, then I 
Did it once again

Don't know what to do, get back right with you
Feels like I just walked right out
Someone told me that if it’s meant to be
She’ll wake up one day, and she’ll forgive me
So the best thing I can do
Is to just let her, let her go, I know
And the more I push, the more she pulls away from me
So I’m asking God for help, Lord I’m just a G
And I need her, I didn’t treat her the way she was meant to be treated
'Cause Lord I did her wrong and she’s gon' leave again
Feels like I just walked right out of heaven
Feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, hey
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, get back right with you

It's umbrellas on my sweater for bitches thats under weather
Blowin' kisses at the cheddar when I test that jaw

Yaught pimpin' on another cruise
Foreign model from another niggas pedestals

Bad bitch just touched down, she Tom Brady

You was on the feet, nigga, I was on my ass
You was in the sheets, nigga, I was on the ave
You was in the class nigga, I was on the dash
Hustlin' in corners, swearin' I was a goner
Welcome to the USA, I was a foreigner
Fame was a beautiful bitch, so I joined her

You my number one, just know that you got no contenders
You keep that pussy so clean when I be goin' in
I'd spend my life in your box, don't need no codefendant
Go 'head, cut these niggas off like they have no existence
They can't go the distance, I'm oh-for-oh for instance
Fuck the gym, let me pull up and give that stroke of fitness
She a five-star shawty, still down to go for Denny's
Down to go for Wendy's
McDonald's chicken fries, thickest thighs
Seen it in her eyes, shawty know I know I seen her
Netflix and chill, and we can go to dinner
My schedule busy, but for you, girl, I'll make no agenda
You got no contenders
You kept it hot for me all in my cold Decembers

Don't be trippin' on these niggas that you lovin' on
You gon' fuck 'em, treat 'em like you don't remember
Ooh, I need to have it 'til the day you gone

Whatever you want
More than happy to provide it
Wet like Poseidon
Whatever you want 
Oh, shawty, don't you deny it
It feel like we flyin'
Whatever you want 
You know I can provide it
Pullin' up to Story after Mr. Jones
Only thing I care about is who gon' get you home
My cigar full of this weed so I can switch the tone
We stumble to my house drunk, is anybody home?
Words slurrin' and my vision blown, different zone
Room spinnin', I don't know
Unzip my pants and get to blowin', you so nasty
Then what's up with me?
You stayed up tonight to fuck with me
Mmh, lucky me
Gucci panties, sit that pussy on some double G's
Fifty pairs of those'll only cost a couple G's, yeah
Just give me something to work with
Something with purpose
First time that we fucked, girl, you was nervous
Moanin' 'fore I even started touchin' the surface
Whatever you want
Whatever you want, hah
Whatever you want if you that quiet, shit
She want it now and fast
Grabbin' and smackin' ass, make it last
Beat me to the finish, wave the checkered flag
Toe tag, left the pussy on a deathbed
Been milkin' the game since I was breastfed
Long enough to know that women with lisps give the best head
But not with braces
Your pussy talking's the only conversation, yap, yap
Grab her hair, pull her track back
Got somethin' to prove
Not from Houston but I got somethin' to screw at all times
She said it's all mine
All dimes, y'all fuck with nickels
I be in them guts, pokin' them sides until it tickles
Squeeze the Charmin on her soft ass
No, I don't pay 'em to come, I pay 'em to go, ho
No credit, all cash 
Be slidin' up and use a worthful transaction
And then just hop up off my dick with no attachments
Usin' prophylactics 
Safe to say this song is whatever you want
But it's limited to this penis and a blunt
Holler at me, Luda
Whatever you want 
More than happy to provide it
Wet like Poseidon
Whatever you want 
Oh, shawty, don't you deny it
It feel like we flyin'
Whatever you want 
You know I can provide it 
Ooh, yeah, yeah

They both one and the same
Cupid's the one to blame
Say it 
I'm 'bout to shed some light
'Cause each and every night
You gotta do it right 
I'm 'bout to throw some game
They both one and the same
Cupid's the one to blame, say it

Oh, for sure
They don't even fuck with each other like that
She was in the car talkin' 'bout it and shit
Yeah, aight
Well, yo, look
Nigga, we was up in the barbershop the other day 
Smokin' blunts, drinkin' liquor 
Shootin' dice, talkin' shit
Aight, my nigga, I get it
What, like what you tryna tell me, bro? What's good?
Well, yo, my mans was tellin' me, bro

Hang up this phone
Ayy, yo, man, you know moms wildin' and shit
Man, you know what I'm sayin', it's all good 
I'ma holler at you later, bruh
Aight, my niggaYeah, yeah
Dope stash in my Bimmer, I can cash out on Adidas
Should I trap or should I rap and spend this cash all on a feature?
My niggas is in the field and they adopted, so I teach
But I gotta spend this cash all on this motherfuckin' re-up
I'm tryna be a leader but, shit, I'm fallin' in my past
The trap callin' for this cash, I scrape the bottom of the stash
Front a nigga one and I can press it, I can stretch that bitch to half
A lot of shit a nigga never had a nigga's tryna grab
And R.I.P. my nigga Black 'cause they done chopped him into pieces
He was tryna duck polices, I was tryna duck the Reaper
I was on the block, hustlin', just tryna stuff the reefer
In the pocket with the nina, shit, I'm poppin' with the heater if I need her
I'm in the kitchen bakin' like Anita, tryna freak it like Adina, sell and sneak it to a beaner
I was younger, was fuckin' up the re-up coppin' sneakers
'Cause the OGs never taught me how to be up, I got beat up
On them corners, but I came back
Trap back jumpin', had it poppin' on the same track
Lil' mama thuggin', got my name as her face tat
Shit, you gotta face facts
It's some real niggas in this shit, you can't replace that
Same block, same strap, shoot a nigga face back
Leave his head in his legs, waist in his wave cap
Cocked the K back, was blowin' blades where his braids at
Cocked the K back, had so much pain so I stained that
Mama cried tears, we did bids throughout the years
I had a couple niggas die and I'm just wishin' you was here, but shit is clear
I'm ridin' with my pistol like a Piston through the fear and let them niggas know I'm here
I promise when I die, they celebrate me like I'm 'Pac
It'll be because I reached my goal, not 'cause I sold this rock
Any nigga that try to hate me, promise, dawg, they gon' get shot
I'm from the Dot and I got some niggas that's still down to knock your top
I put this on my baby, this being broke shit done drove me crazy
All my friends done got ghost and went Swayze
My number-one question now is, "Lord, am I gon' make it?"
'Cause it's times I feel alone and just so hopeless on this pavement
I tried to work a nine-to-five, but I can't wait for payment
Shit, that shit just take too long and plus the feelin' so complacent
But I look at that road and it's like my goals are so adjacent
The devil on my shoulder, it's gettin' colder in this basement
I got killers on the left of me, drug dealers on my right
To the world they look scary, but I knew these niggas all my life
And now my little nigga scammin', he tryna cop it off a swipe
I remember different nights, duckin' cops and runnin' flights of stairs
Niggas gettin' scared, but, pussy boy, that ain't my type
I threw it up with niggas past my weight and twice my height
Ever sat up in that dark place just tryna find a light?
I can't even trust myself, my left hand don't know my right
I can put this on my dead mama
Marijuana sales done bought this Ferragamo
Out of state licks, done got to flex some Moncler on 'em
Bitch, I'm all smiles like the logo of the Murakami
Niggas can't stop me, now they fearin' on me
Only thing I fear is God, I can never fear the odds
Eric committin' a suicide the only time you seen the tears fall
Shot my nigga Nesta in his head, they tried to clear 'em off
Then my cousin Dave got shot in front of grandma's
I been in them shootouts in the parkin' lots and standoffs
Real plugs where I'm from, no niggas never ranned off
Give it to my lil' nigga, pass it by the hand-off
Had to sell him game, you gotta pass and put your man on
'Cause even if I
Even if I don't get it
Then I might die trying
'Cause I was born broke but I'ma die rich
Even if I
If I never get it
I'll still have this dope stash when I blow past
Sellin' snow like it's winter in the forecast
I gotta make it
I gotta make it
Said, I gotta make it
And if they won't give it to me, I'm gon' take it, woah
I gotta make it
I gotta make it
And if they won't give it to me, I'm gon' take itBaby need shoes, mama need a house, goin' through racks again
Baby mama bitchin' 'bout another bitch and I got 'em racks again
Caught me down when I was slippin', but I promise I'll never lack again
My shooter trigger finger itchy, nigga, might just hit you on accident
Reload the strap again, we comin' back again
You double-crossed on a nigga, we hit him and it ain't by accident
Throwin' new racks again, blowin' through stacks again
Hella new plaques again, spittin' these facts again
Sippin' the dirtiest, baby
The shipment come, we get the earliest, baby
I'ma spend it, I'm courteous, baby
The first to the fuckin' thirtieth, baby
It ain't a place a nigga can't go
One Umbrella, that's the fuckin' gang though
Had to imprint it on a chain though
Switchin' different whips like I'm lil' Django
I done came up from the sidewalk
Now I rap, nigga used to slang dope
From the fistfights to the shootouts
In the parking lot and now it's bankroll
Was a broke nigga, now I came up
I don't do this shit to entertain ya
Can't believe I even got this famous
Yesterday, I was grippin' on a stainless
I was sellin' dope from out the Popeyes
I was whippin' corner counter-clockwise
Tryna get the Porsche with the frog eyes
Sellin' dope, a nigga should be top five
Got extended clip inside a Glock 9
It was never times I forgot mine
If a nigga trippin', turn to Columbine
Shootin' anybody that his shots find
Niggas say that they deserve my position
But them pussy niggas, they did not grind
If we talkin' 'bout shit that separates me and you, nigga, it's a long line
I done came through, Bentayga Bentley
Never thought that I'd be seein' this when I was young and I was playin' Sega Genesis
Pancake seats made at Denny's, that's real nigga shit
We don't pay a bitch nigga debt
Bet your life on the line 'cause we don't make lil' nigga bets, nah
Look at all this dope, it ain't by accident
Bitch nigga, I'm froze, it ain't on accident
She gon' give me that throat, it ain't on accident
Fuck nigga, just know
Throwin' more racks again, blowin' through stacks again
Bitch, I might back the Benz, it ain't on accident
Backin' that back again , done fucked up my stacks again 
Nigga get clapped again, it ain't on accident
Shitted on 'em, so I know they mad
Copped my freezer from AZ in Rollie bag
Grippied up, we don't care where the police at
And we scorin', fuckboy, where your homies at?
Niggas know us, we 'bout it, we love to drill
Some my youngins be on that, they love the field
We pull up, we blastin' this shit for real
Mama said, "It's for nothin', you need to chill"
I'm goin' off, still on that gang shit
But I told you ain't lane switch
I catch a lick, it ain't really 'bout shit
We gon' spin off the strip and just change whips
Ain't no security with me, we totin' like fifty, that's life if the gang slip
But fuck it, we live how we live and I know what I did, plus it's too late to change shit
Ain't no fightin', that Glock rearrange shit
If you tryna meet death, I'll arrange it
In a foreign, I pick up your main bitch
She was suckin' my dick and I came quick
I ain't even gon' talk on the opp side
Y'all could say what y'all want, but do not slide
Caught him slippin', he ran into Popeyes
Everybody all tough 'til them shots fly, gang
Look at all this dope, it ain't by accident
Bitch nigga, I'm froze, it ain't on accident
She gon' give me that throat, it ain't on accident

Short black nigga in the Benzo

Girl, don't try to put me in the friendzone
Young nigga, still ride with 'em on the low low

Look, you my chick, let her full trick
While am still shootin' with numerous shots from the .44
I done moved on
But I don't want you to go home
I don't I want you to move on
I don't want you to see me at the light
But you do and I got another you on my futon
All in together, Jane and Finch where I met her
Thinkin' 'bout it all in the present
That was that 4-1
I would never forfeit on bullshit
And you would never fold for my cheddar
I was young successful, young and reckless
Runnin' reckless, tryna find the time to check it
It was wrong, I thought that time would tell
But damn, I fucked it up, and now I guess I'm just
Selfish, I'm selfish
'Cause I moved on and I don't want you boo
Selfish, I'm selfish
When I move on and I don't want you too
I'm selfish, I'm selfish
Just a young unlucky motherfucker in a Bimmer
I need ya to myself and then I leave ya
I did the same shit with Tina, Gina, Ashley and even Leena
Believe me, this shit hard but I make it look easy
For the go, got the crack on the low
You leave and I'm back in for more, young nigga

Young nigga with a dream, just chasin'
Big cake, lil nigga, no birthday
Backwood for the worst day
With a 1 back then I would back when
I was in the city of my my birthplace
Young girl runnin' with the keys to my heart
Shit hard but my heart so cold that it key wouldn't start it
Made a pact to my bosses
That if it don't go right I'ma keep you apart
In the future, it sound loose but it's truthful
And I ain't stupid, I know you out there lookin' for
Somethin' new but I know you still missin' what you used to
Love and lust and sex and trust and next is guess
I fucked it up and yes I know I will regret the extra stuff
Well stop me there 'cause that's enough
Been young and wild, we take for granted
All the things you planted in this life, we know you made for us
It's dangerous just to maintain us, babe, look uh
I'm the nigga out there
I don't know what was salty at all
But you know shit different out there
Back then, I was always downtown like I'm livin' out there
Nigga, these days I be in a new Lear
New key cup, blue pool clear
Only thing missin' is a bad one
Fuck that only thing missin' girl is you here
I been I be tryna front though
Only tellin' ain’t nobody I can front for
Yeah, when I'm runnin' right back on the low
Got the crack for the low
When you leave then I'm back in for more, young nigga
I'm not 'bout to lie on it
We don't even talk, oh no no more
So I'm not 'bout to lie on it
You can't be no one else's
'Cause I'm selfish, I'm selfish
I don't wanna be selfish
Tell me is it selfish? Am I selfish?
I don't wanna be selfish
Tell me is that selfish?
Tell me is that selfish?

People hustle all they life for diamonds and gold
And lose it all in one night by sellin' they soul
As the memories come and the memories go
People die every day but the memories don't
This my motherfuckin' albumThumbin' through this check, I'm 'bout to violate
My swag be fuckin' up the tri-state
I might confront you niggas, nah please
Bitch I move it spicy with that I A 
A nigga pulled up in a i8
Wavin' at you niggas like, "Hi hater"
My bitches love to ball, Sanaa Lathan
This that New Toronto, keep the driver waiting
Yeah, thank the Lord, I'm takin' charge
How can I forget when niggas made a star?
Smokin' in this whip I​ bought for 80 large
I am rich bitch, I could buy 80 cars
Triple goose, I'm feathered in it
My bitches silly, your bitches look whatever in it
Lift up the doors, got me feather weighted
Never say never, but pussy, my shit never endin'
When my momma died, they gave me Halmark's
I told myself, I get a crib as big as Walmart
I spit the days aimin', pointin' like a war dart
Now I spent the day, grace the stage at the ball park
We don't resort to violence, just resorts and islands
Book you nigga's for a show, get you scorched and silenced
Ironically, my keys got a horse and my whip visa Porsche
And I am hoppin' out the doors for stallions
Way before my lifestyle was marvellous
Could crack the code but it's back to that boulevard with us
When it was dark taxi cab will never stop with us
Non stop, four money, four blocks
I juiced and stressed, sellin' for four blocks
Pop found a four in my dresser, phone rock
Now I stressed, the compresser is still oppressive
Got me stuntin' on my exes
Short and sick, spent a couple hundred on my dresser
Said fuck that, left a couple hundred for my dresser
There's a war goin' on outside and we got pressure
So I ride with the strap, no joker, Heath Ledger
For Scarborough, Sauga City, Brampton
Thumbin' through the check I'm about to violate 
My swag be fuckin' up the tri-state
Shout out to Jane & Finch
I might confront you nigga's, nah please
Bitch, I move it spicy with that I A, hi daddy
My Rexdale niggas
A nigga pulled up in a i8
Wavin' at you niggas like, "Hi hater"
My bitches love to ball, so now I laid it
This that New Toronto, keeper drive away Yeah
Names that you know me by, praise to the holy high
Shit, been a lonely ride, all I do is only try
Weed is my only high, magazine forty-five
I can tell the pain in youngin' from my shorty's eyes
Rap niggas gettin' at me, young niggas pickin' at me
I'm shootin' past the limits, a nigga trigger happy
Shade Room gettin' nasty, Black girls flippin' at me
Bestfriends switchin' on me, shit, at least a nigga happy
White drapes on the wall, white babes on the call
Spanish joints on the call, white grape on the pour
Champagne where you see us, man came from to see us
Jay-Z and Penny Marshalls, I felt that and it's awful
Fake niggas tryna play me, lame bitches tryna blame me
Same niggas gassed up, same niggas tryna flame me
We made it past the margin and past the section eighty
We got white people marchin', this shit is fuckin' crazy
We gon' be on the favors, I'm soapy on the faker
It's real shit goin' on, George and Breonna Taylor
Type shit ain't on the fogal, fly bitches on my scrotum
They pay me for appearance and pay me for my vocals
Yeah, fuck all that happy shit niggas want me on
It's niggas in my line of work that want me gone
House that come with alarms, spouse that come with a charm
Lamb' that sit in garage, that don't come from the farm
I see wonderful views, when God got me, it'll pay any one of my dues
Holla at one of y'all, choose, how I was one of them dudes
Well if you was them you'd probably front on me too
Yeah, if I was you and you were me, I would stunt on me too
Cash from seein' blessings, I got too much money at this point to be aggressive
I hate bein' outside knowin' I need to stress it
I hate overprovin' myself without bein' present, preach nigga
Get in the booth now, so I'm like givin' it my own shit now
Lame niggas talk about me, same niggas walk around me
Hate me and strongly doubt me, I feel like Robert Downey
Back through the fly again, hoes sayin' "hi" again
Newly and improved suit, yeah lil' bitch, I'm Ironman
Hotter than bacon oil sittin' in the fryin' pan
New set of wings on me, Red Bull, flyin' man
We don't even count the money, we weigh it up and we eye the bands
I'm pullin' fuckin' strings, I feel like Einer Bankz
God usin' my situation to break the limitations
Soar past the niggas hatin', more past the shit that's waitin'
Devil in his recreations, Black on Black segregation
Turnin' us against each other, faith ain't gotta test your patience
Black boy, shine, nigga, Black women, grow baby
Black boy and Black women together, now that's a soul baby
That's on my soul, baby, down to the toes, baby
The feelin' to feel like "d-d-d, d-d-d, d-d-d, d-d-d, d-d-d"
Let's have some conversations, F all the contemplations
Look how we livin', young world, peep all the abominations
Shit is a prime example, truth in that time of answer
Truth and the time'll tell like Mike and Chance when it's time to sample
Slide through the vacant door, fuck niggas hate me more
Have we got this critical that we can't even be human and let niggas even make mistakes anymore?
What happened to bein' us? What happened to bein' more? Wassup
Woah, sexy moonlight dance on the horizon
It's over, it's cold and full of violence
I pray you find peace inside the silence
I pray that you see the light
Your words sting like bees all on my body
Make me sip, I speed in that Bugatti
Devil's on my soul and on my body
Just pray that I see the light
You know I-I realize I want to be like a-a walkin' testimony to-to kids
Or to-to teens and people who are worldwide that, you know they allow like the internet, the social media, the fake ass cancel culture to bring 'em down and—
You know thirty comments, two hundred comments, a thousand comments about you one day brings your world down
I want y'all to look at me and realize I'm walkin' testimony of someone who just doesn't give a fuck about none of that shit
Imagine the whole fuckin' world and a bunch of millions of mothafucka's just hatin' at the same time
Actin' like as if you're not human as if, you know a thousand death threats later you gon' feel the same you gon'—, you know?
But in all of that, you know, I kept a smile on my face because I knew what I know and beyond everything I want you to look at my situation and gain strength from me and realize that nigga, say what, "I didn't give a fuck, you ain't gotta give a fuck either"
And whatever you gon' do shall pass just like everything else in your life
You know the waves go, they go and you keep sailin'
Just keep sailin', keep sailin', keep sailin'
Eventually, you get to your destination and guess what?
You look back and you can't even see niggas no more
So never forget, it's three things: how special you are, the purpose you come with, the reason you're here
God bless youNa, na, na, oh yeah
Fiesta
PARTY
Oh I'm leaning, 420 leaning

Bitch, I look so good, even the dykes watch me
I'm on Dyckman with a bad lightskin
Chain rain so much water they think we 'bout to have lightning
When I spit, niggas think I'm in that lab fightin'
Niggas think that I'm left hooking and I'm jab writin'
One thing is, I ain't in that lab writin', nigga everything is off top
Word to my bald spot
I used to have to stash work in my broad spot
Cops came, had to stash work in her bra strap
Phone calls and my connect is just a call drop
We don't count down on those, that's a ball drop
Come on akh, pretendin' y'all niggas on block
Twin fives put like ten of y'all niggas on shots
We could do it however y'all niggas wan' rock
Make this shit pop like oil in a chrome pot
And it don't stop
I'm not a picture painter but I will put a nigga in his own chalk
I let the .9 spill
I got a ill lil' shooter out in Brownsville down for the wild deal
I'll feel blessed if nigga test and my shooter leave him streched 'til the bones in his spine chill
I'm ill nigga, this is not a time drill
I used to serve on the strip and watch Seinfield
Man, I remember serving on the strip
Watching out for cops hopping out suburbans on the strip
Working on the strip, chilling with a .30 on my hip
Whole team of shooters, bunch of Steph Curries in my clique
Boy, I'm a wild boy, check the style, boy
I'm a real baller, you a towel boy
I'll put 'em in the future, no Elroy
'Cause I pop tops like I'm opening some Altoids
Breath minty and fresh Fendi
Got a hustler chick down to smuggle bricks through the West Indies
I'll hustle 'til it's nothing left in me 
And the plug hear 'bout me and gotta invest in me
I send semi's at any nigga that's testin' me
I'm prayin' to the lord, he's the one that been blessing me
But yo, I got a sick set
And my jewels like dipset
And we on cam like dipset
These fuck niggas say they coming for the kid neck?
Give ya dog shots like I'm checking in a sick pet
Got street ties with the street guys
Even if they fly on G5s, they'll kill you for a G5
Fifteen hunnid, my FN gunning
My dawg copped twenty birds, and they just keep coming
He sold four and plus he let a sick team run 'em
We ain't talking 'bout a verse when it's a sixteen coming, check
I'm a real nigga
I keep a Tommy on my body but when you see me, I ain't wearin' Hilfigher
Just a ladder and a roofer that'll drill niggas
And down to take his own charge when he kill niggas
Look, I'm the hot kid in the school
I pull up to the party and I pop chicks in the pool
Hot chicks say I'm hot and my dick is a jewel
Just let me box with that twat, I'll stick it and move
Yo, she like the way my wrist dance
She like the way the wrists on my fist dance
Every time a nigga switch hands

You would thinks the guns designer, they way they come in rip pants
Wrist cuts, my wrist slants and I'm in the truck getting jiggy, tryna get up in your chick pants
Bitch dance
It's four hoes with me, if them four hoes did me, shawty, it won't be a fifth chance
My whole stretch from south France to Brisbane
And they attached to the arms like wrist bands
Look, I send 'em up and I'ma send them niggas back if they sent 'em up
My dawg got a twenty on him and a semi tucked
But, I've been in so many life or death situations, I just wanna live it up
I dropped it off and I picked it up
And my jewels all embedded and I'm feeling six'erd up
I'm in the club tryna find a thick chick to fuck
Man, after all my neck and wrist is all glittered up
Bitches wanna fuck it up, now they want to lick it up
They man hear about it next day and wan' get me touched
In a Bentley, tints tucked, Cuban linked up
Big chain on me in case I gotta get you inked up
Wrink up, see the wrist roller wrinked up
Whole squad looking like we robbed us a Brinks truck
Any cat that know Lanez know I'm worldwide

Look, I do this for that youngin' on the corner
That hustle all day though he never had a daughter
He never had a father, he hustle in the corner
I'm telling that he wilding tryna truck the shit to Florida
But niggas love to hustle, it's aura
When you come up from the poor, you struggle and you sure
You gon' do it for mother, lost your brother to the force
So you in the only son to keep the loving in the core
Every day you ducking strays tryna run in to the store
And you can't afford a bed, layin' covers on the floor
And you momma's stressing and her blood pressure getting lower
And your daughter want that brand new toy
But it's hard to show her that you broke and can't afford it
So you on the corner, niggas talking shit and the plug, he keep avoidin' ya
So you wanna hustle and you tryna get your coin up
Out there on your own, but shit, Satan will corner ya
So you wanna own, tryna get your own up
Now I'm on my own, I'm just tryna get my own up

Nigga, ma died daddy wasn't there
I was out here gettin' money with the scale
Brother in jail, need a canteen?
Now I'm sendin' money in the mail
Runnin' from the law
Only thing a nigga fearin' out here is the Lord, nigga
Did it all for my dogs, in a fresh pair of draws
Aw yeah, hit the window with the top down
Ride around, niggas in the mini caravan
Lookin' for a new wrist
Drop down in a bent air force, I be lookin' for a new link
Sure nigga, oh boy, you can tell them old niggas that it's over
Nigga came with that new shit, true shit
Dog, I been waitin' on you niggas
Motherfuckers hatin' on me, but it's cool
I'm gettin' paper, why you suckers got to play on a nigga?
For the name hoes change, nigga
Watch what you claim on these bitches
But the fame, my nigga
For the fame, only real bitch I had was Keisha
And she still changed on a nigga
You could picture the pain in my scriptures
Lame in your mixture
Young nigga, hangin' my tone
From the cold ass nights I was stinkin' alone
And my clothes ranked and they reeked of the dank ass weed
From the blanks and the floor, my nigga
Just love if you love me, don't ask me for nothin'
Just know that you got it
When Jay comin' back to Miami next week
Then you know that it's poppin'
I'm all in your crib like I'm Santa bitch
Don't make me open your stockings, open like Stockton
Grandma told me if I'm gonna be somethin'
Then it better be lawyer or doctor
But I'ma make more as a rapper, make more as a rapper
She ain't believe me, I did it and told her to open my chapter
And that's how you show by example
You see, my mom always thought I should get a regular job
She didn't really see the future in this, I had to show her
I had the license to burn money in what I was doing
I haven't had a real job in 20 years
If we can do it, so can youWe was just some little niggas
On and off the corner
Just wanna be a baller
I was just a little nigga
Just a little nigga
And I hit my lil lick
Same day I got rich
Then I
Had to drop 600 on the whip
Young nigga comin' out the 6, nigga 
Grandma kicked a nigga out the crib
Now where the fuck am I supposed to live, nigga?
Oh God help a nigga get it how I live
'Cause I was in the kitchen with the whip, nigga
Young nigga found out quick
This trappin' shit ain't really where it is, nigga
I just want my money when I come in the bank
Fishin' for the snitches like there's one in the tank
See the teller talkin' when I come to the bank
See I'm the realest, number 1 in the ring
You know, I had it fly for a new wrist
Jack tripper bubble cup, paint cool whip
These niggas try to hit me with a full clip
I admit it I was slippin' on the bullshit
Then I hopped in it
Fitted with my niggas, talkin' armageddon
Yeah what come around, goin' back around
But I ain't got the time to let the karma get him
Nigga, did it for a new wrist
Had to put him on a news clip
Went from workin' down at Mickey D's
To eatin' out at the Ruth Chris
The roaches would crawl at my crib on the floor
Man, I came up from nothin'
Was 14 and rollin' with niggas so cold that it ain't no discussion
Bought me a .40, I got me a .40, hope cops don't come for me
When you live up in that jungle them niggas try shot for your lonely
I'm up in the 600
My mind on that quick money
I just did my T-4
Now motherfuck my PO
I'm whippin' that box foreign
You talk but your bitches is not foreign
I'm the kid with the benefits
Don't make me that kid with the Glock .40'90s televisions, that raised me
Made me feel like it was gravy, I wasn't crazy
Nowadays, the kids all lazy, the pics all crazy
In the land of doin' drugs and bustin' clips off safety
I be cryin' to the Lord in the times that I feel unsure
Wisdom of the Scriptures like carvin' lines in the sword
I pray we stick together like all the vines on the wall
Climbin' until we fall and drivin' until we stall
Designer clothes got us here dyin' in every store
Buyin' it when we poor, knowin' this shit a hassle and
Money that should've been going to ownin' bigger castles
And still we'll dibble-dabble and try to find it abroad
Livin' life in this fog, our eyes covered
With all the self-inflicted danger, we could die from it
I'm runnin' through the game just tryna find some ties from it
I was buggin' the times that I said that I love it
Because I grew to love myself and who hovers above me
And plus my family and my brothers who love me
This is God purpose
I know the Devil wanna scratch me off surface
But every attempt he tryin' is worthless, that boy'll never get me
Or represent me, fall out and get to resent me
I'm part of Jehovah army, I know exactly who sent me
And I don't mean to sound like I'm preachin' you down
Disregard my past ways, this what I'm teachin' you now
Words that I should've been spoke, I'ma speak 'em up now
Niggas try to ether my style while keepin' me down
I can tell you, so many people wan' find reason for livin'
Wanna be a helpin' hand, but don't know how to give it
I told 'em, "Fall on your knees, repent for your evil deeds
Ask God to show you, but, nigga, actually seek
Mean it when you say it, don't pray it because I told you

Next thing you're down, out and you don't get it
I ain't holdin' you down, down on love
Unless you're down, down on loveI'm back!

Uh
Soon as you hear this verse, I'm out the record deal
Exceeded twelve albums, four years, and that's a record still
Hand to the sky like Emmett Till off the steppin' wheel
And minus all the sex appeal, your boy about to flex for real
Rolls-Royce Cullinan, four-doors 'cause my son in it
I'm drivin' down the Gardiner, Toronto, home city
With two tings that I partnered up, playin' putter and possum
Then I puff with my girls like Buttercup with a Blossom
Excessive needs for pussy, power, and SUVs
That drop us to the back-door entrances, stress relief
And no less, indeed, the shooters is pressin' like refugees
And the fee at the entranceway too high just to let 'em free
What can't alarm me is whose crew's finna harm me
My little dudes move like new recruits in the army
And all they see is food, shrimps, scallops, and calamari
I gallivant at a Barbie while they gather back at your party
Uh, should let the women I fuck raw and unprotected
Like, fuck, if you get pregnant, I'll keep it
Keep a secret, only in town for a week, and I'm
Datin' women knowin' I'm cheatin' for foreign reasonin'
Fuck y'all niggas throwin' y'all beef in, I'm goin' vegan with Heaven's timin'
Shootin' and set designin', they're movin' like I sold ten million records in record timin'
I did, then I kept on climbin'
I started at 90 Orenda, plays and private agendas
Tryna get fly, but niggas tried and I kindly reject 'em
They ran my name through the mud, but I'm finally respected
This here out of the plan, this more of a God purpose
This here out of my hands, this'll never feel like 2012
Signin' to Sean Kingston for clout and advance
I'm still proud of that man, know I fell out from his hands
He didn't do me worse than — and all of his friends
Them niggas out of this world, they came out of the sands
I'm still 'bout it, my mans
Thought this shit was mad love 'til I see my album advance
They took radio from me, I stayed proud of my stance
I kept slappin' the world with hits like I powdered my hands
I would've been ten times bigger if — wasn't bein' bitter and doubtin' my chance
Threatenin' to shelf my whole career for five years
As if he wasn't takin' money from out my advance
I got out by chance
Them nights was like the Super Bowl, watchin' out from the stands
God don't make things happen by chance
And it's some things you gon' have to experience
I'm dappin' up the border officer passin' the clearance
He always makes a corny joke 'bout my rapper appearance
Then I do a fake laugh that he catches like pass interference
I fly back into Paris
Blunt smoke ash on my terrace
My competition's just a empty-ass class full of chairs
Talkin' to myself, it's lonely, minus the fact that I'm here
I'm tryna see all of my niggas blossom
Mariah sellin' shows, Coachella her first year
And minus all the times we disagree, I'm still here
Pierre, Papi Yerr 'bout to be a whole millionaire
Davo comin' out the cut with a chick with Sicilian hair
Mansa droppin' next month, you niggas should be in fear
Watchin' Melii do the numbers like she runnin' track and field
Plus we just got Kaash in here
And it's all Umbrella army on full attack mode, for real
New Toronto 3, I'll leave it at that
And ain't nobody fuckin' with me, folk, I'll keep it at that, yeah
The next move is goin' fully independent
And any label offer under hundred mill' is just offensive
I promiseUh, it's all good 'til that ride go low
And the hoes you was fuckin', they don't slide no more
That's why I'm on this I-95 alone
Ridin' with the windows down, tryna sip it down now, uh
I think about it when I'm high, oh no
Like I don't even expect you to ride no more
Guess I can't worry 'bout nothin' but mine no ,ore
That's why I'm on this I-95 like no no no no no
It's like nothin' all over now
West side girls, where the fuck you been?
If you really know a nigga, holla at me then
Am I still fuckin' with these bitches?
Told myself I wouldn't but she's here inside my livin' room
Same slick dress on, lipstick pressed on
Gave a couple reasons why she ain't for bein' slept on
Killer in the line of that outfit designer they just came out with
She got a problem maxin' out my card, I hardly doubt it
That's why I'm out in all these malls tryna call accountants
And any time she do me wrong, I start to fuck more 'bout it
Bitches that's down to stripin' down to they slickest outfits
And they just wanna fuck the kid with kicks that ain't come out yet
And I'm just livin' life, no chaser, lemon spice
Young entertainer, livin' life just like I'm Evan White
Pacin' all my blatant move
Like from the line and shootin' threes, you could be takin' twos
You know you greater so you just do what you made to do
Fuck what they say dog?
Just pray to God and make it through, now make your moves, nigga
Uh, it's all good 'til that ride go low
And the hoes you was fuckin', they don't slide no more
That's why I'm on this I-95 alone
Ridin' with the windows down, tryna sip it down now, uh
I think about it when I'm high, oh no
Like I don't even expect you to ride no more
Guess I can't worry 'bout nothin' but mine no ,ore
That's why I'm on this I-95 like no no no no no
That's why I'm on this I-95 like no no no no no
West side girls, where the fuck you been?
If you really know a nigga, holla at me thenI, I, I remember them streets so well
I, I, I remember them people well
Them, them, them, them same niggas
Walk around and be tellin' everybody I changed nigga
I know that you only wanna fuck with me 'cause I hope you get
You say you want the old me 'cause the old me nigga was broke as shit
That's what you want huh? That's what you want huh?
Just gon' and say it to my face, my nigga, don't lie
Lately niggas been fakin', no blow but a nigga's been patient
Low blows, niggas just hatin', oh no
They just want to mess around and turn me to the nigga I used to be
Chillin' with the girls that I used to see
And all them same girls wanna keep it real with everybody else
And never want to tell the truth to me
But on the outside I'm a cool ass nigga
Y'all can't see all the pain nigga hold
Y'all can't see all the pain nigga show
Sittin' back watchin' all these lame niggas blow
But uh, don't trip 'cause I know a nigga time comin'
I be waitin' on the shit like a ride comin'
But right now I got to sit it on the side youngin'
Don't worry, I'ma get it, I get it
The fam like, "Nigga, admit it ya did it" and I be like, "Nigga, I ain't did shit"
Mind on the big shit, time for the big shit
I been on the grind so long, it's ridiculous
But niggas gon' doubt, well tell 'em wake there ass and see
I promise ya'll it's gon' happen for me!
I can't let you haters be my stress
Even though y'all done me all wrong
When they gon' cut me my check
Haters I remember all y'all, haters I remember all y'all
I, I, I used to walk around free
I, I know that you often doubt me
I, I can't help but feel the pain
Some nights nigga needed sun light but I really can't help but feel the rain
My gift, God given, hard liquor for hard livin'
My bluntness, pardon it, got a dream, gon' get it
Nigga, I'm never gon' go, let you niggas get used to me
Nigga, I'm feelin' so low that a nigga need a booster seat
I still feel like a bet he gon' get 'em
I'm in the studio like 24/7
I be on the move, plenty momentum
I ain't got room for any more venom
For you snakes and shit, the fakes in shit
It just makes me sick
This is not the motherfuckin' life a nigga signed up for
Lookin' at it like this can't be it
Damn, what a real nigga gots to do
To get a condo with a private view?
'Cause I be in the game lookin' at the superstars like
Everythin' you doin' nigga, I can do
So how could you be so arrogant, some of y'all people?
Walk around here like ya runnin' our people
And they talk like everyone is our equal
Y'all niggas fake, everyone of y'all see through
I can't let you haters be my stress
Even though y'all done me all wrong
When they gon' cut me my check
Haters I remember all y'all, haters I remember all y'allLightin' up a Cuban cigar down Collins Ave

Boy, they got me movin' like the hall of fame
Arm through the rim, Vince Carter
Your flow easy and your beats bore me

Plugged up 'til the day they call police on me
Say my shit the hardest 'cause my shit the hardest
In ten years, we'll check back 'bout who's the bigger artist
Whole clique of artists and they 'bout to get shit started
Even though the kid alone, could have your shit deported

So I'm in the VIP strip club section, I'm gettin' hot rubs
Big dutty .45 on me, in case they pop up
'Cause when the shot sober
Niggas leave you slouched over in the couch sofa
Dawg, especially when the block know ya

Oh DjadjaI remember I was 9 when my brother used to rhyme
Used to see him spit, switch flows, and hold nines
Seen the same bro catch case and hold time
All that made me wanna do is continue his prime
As a youngin' all I wanted was to be that nigga
All they did was look at you and be like, "He that nigga"
Older brother, older son of mother
One I would look up to in the source
Hopin' that one day you'd be the one that I turn into
I figured it was just a figment of imagination
The magic made this moment happen
Look at me growin'
Just that after all these years, they had you waitin'
In that cell while niggas givin' you hell, I knew you was still basic
And when them cells close and spite cover your eyes
I just pray God let light cover your skies
Hope your inner stressin' don't mess with you inside
Keep holdin' your head high with some blessings in the sky, my nigga
Things don't always go, always go your way
I know, everything that shine ain't gold
And we might think we're close
But even we can be far away
I know, everything that shine ain't gold
Everything that shine ain't gold
It ain't gold, it ain't gold
Everything that shine ain't gold
Things don't always go, always go your way
I know, everything that shine ain't gold
And we might think we're close
But even we can be far away
I know, everything that shine ain't gold
Everything that shine ain't gold
It ain't gold, it ain't gold
Everything that shine ain't goldSee the difference between me and you niggas

But I be with it when the drama there
Niggas pull up on me playin' Gotti, gotta pocket rocket when I pop in there

Now I only use that money to let wifey shop

For so many reasons

All my drinkers get your liq' right, yeah
Word to Jada, I'm smokin' fire, yeah, uh
Look, look, uh, yeah
I look at it funny, a whole lot of money
I'm juggin' it for me, ridiculous
I look at it funny when niggas that's gettin' belligerent know what the business is
All of my niggas indigenous
Nigga, take a second, please consider this
Weed, was trimmin' it
Product, was sellin' it, dream, we livin' it
Thinkin' of scammin' and schemes was givin' in
Used to be like, "Niggas over bitches"
Then my bitches kept it over real than niggas
I can feel it in my feelings
Realest shit my heart done ever said was not to chill with niggas
Now I'm backseat, I'm like Malcolm on the black street
With the album, I'm an athlete
The way I be makin' the track meet on the rap sheet 
Look how they did our nigga from Atlanta for not bein' born in Atlanta
The government so underhanded
They handed that shit off to someone who basically scammin'
And fuckin' and duckin' the Challenger full of police
And you know you a champion out here for thuggin' it
I found a loophole that niggas ain't want me to dig in
But, fuck it, I dug in it
All of the water that sit on my neck
It just couldn't amount to the oil that I struck in it
I used to sit in the kitchen so hungry
The oodles and noodles are boilin', bubblin', bubblin'
Mama workin' shift and doublin'
Wasn't 'til late in the night I was comin' in
I was in high school, no curfew, fuckin' hoes like come again
Look at the way that they made it, the people that hated
The divas I dated, the beef and the bullets got fired
The niggas that died, the problems the reaper created
We started with nothin' and made it to somethin'
The duckin' the bullets and keepin' the blade
Love for my dawg, don't wanna be him 'cause he in the cage
I'm deep in the maze
He look at me as I'm rappin' 'bout life in the street and the reason why he in the cage
Only thing different, we both talked about it, but life didn't give back an even exchange
Speakin' of life, my nigga Ike, he doin' three of them thangs
All he ever really wanted was to feed his daughter and get her the key to the Range
Almost stacked himself a milli' in cash, I'm tryna show you niggas he wasn't playin'
He was that nigga you had to go see when you needed a re-up for thangs
I beat up and bang
Pull up the block on the side with the opps and then cleaned up a stain for me and the gang
Shout out my baby 'cause she was the same, give me the brain, Caribbean thing
She willin' and ready and ready for my Willie, just like she Vivian Banks
Shit is insane
That just went over your head like, "Oh, it's a bird, no, oh, oh shit, it's a plane"
I did it again
Pull up to the party, tell all the women to get in the Range
All of the women inside the party wanna get in, but they couldn't fit in the thing
Go on the 'Gram, scroll on the page, look at the shit that I happened to see
Look at what happened to 21 Savage, I'm knowin' that shit could've happened to me
How they gon' cut our nigga from the country for simply rappin' on beats
That happened to reach his goals, touchin' the souls
Of niggas that happened to be out trappin' the trees?
Or packin' the nines, a Gat in their spine, it's that or the back of the seat
I saw a video of his lil' daughter this mornin', it made me so happy to see
Happy her daddy was on the television, acceptin' awards and actually free
Let's keep it real, we ain't finna lie, I think everybody laughed at the memes
And then I realized that that shit is mean
You can't be jokin' 'bout somebody's freedom
Most of these people don't know the severity of a situation, know where they hearin' it
All of the blogs that filter the good and cater the bad, man, we need some clearer shit
I'm on a mission to find me some clarity
I'm on a mission to find me some clarity, nigga, yeah
From the north, from the north, know it's us
Yeah, I, I, I think the biggest misconception about me is, uh
If you from the gang you gon' throw it up
Somehow niggas think I'm arrogant when I say shit
If you from the gang, gon' and throw it up
From the north, throw it up

Overheard discussions, niggas talk about it
Tryna be the greatest, sell a billion records
Standin' right with God is the best way of goin' 'bout it
Think it’s time I take this time to give them blessings
Niggas stressin'
Niggas can't see the situation they gettin' blessed in
Came a ways from, robbin' niggas with them Smith and Wessons
Gotta understand, shows sellin' out, hoes yellin' out
Far from my coke shootin', dope sellin' routes
I kicked it with niggas it was no tellin' 'bout
Some Armenian thugs that blow melons out
I used to play the corner while niggas was playin' on it
I had to stay informed and study, just playin' dormant
Back when I was tryin' to set the play up with Jay and Lawrence
I knew I was 'bout to be major
But fuck it, that’s just a page in the booklet
He’s just a name in the story
You gotta pay your respects, I had to pay it in glory
I would play the block slow 'til the corner block corner shop closed
And play the slots in the winter until I'm snot nosed
Abandoned bastard, I was stranded
I guess that was the cards that I was handed
Sleepin' in the back of broken vans and lands
With both hands inside my lane, yeah nigga, that's just where I landed
Campin' out was always standin' out
I was that nigga that done branched out
I was that nigga so I've spoken 'bout
The brand that these niggas that got focused, they had they hands outNo, I believe nothing in art is inappropriate. I paint what I see
We're going to have to insist that the face be removed
Absolutely not
Look, you son of a bitch
Same clothes on me for a week straight
Pray the Lord help me for my peep's sake
When my mama died, I became a soldier
Papa couldn't save him, I was out there gettin' paper, hol' up
Same clothes on me for a week straight
Pray the Lord help me for my peep's sake
When my mama died, I became a soldier
Papa couldn't save him, I was out there gettin' paper, hol' up
MAC-11, barcodes in my arsenal
Lil' nigga Lost Cause, Arg Fargo
Pray to Lord every night, repentin' every weekend
We was really in the beef and I was really reachin'
Colt .45, bands from my younger peers
See my older niggas die up in they younger years
Ask my brother what the fuck I'm supposed to tell his mother
Know his sister and his cousin, plus his little brother
So we ride for him, caravan slide door
Just the team, just some beef my mother cry for
Copin' with the pain, smokin' in the rain
Movin' Macaulay Culkin, hopin' that it chain
Same clothes on me for a week straight
Pray the Lord help me for my peep's sake
When my mama died, I became a soldier
Papa couldn't save him, I was out there gettin' paper, hol' up
Should we ride 'til the wheels fall
Pay these tickets for your biscuit if it's will call
And when this thief come and tell you I'ma lil dog
Stone cold, we just wanted that control, lil nigga, hold up
I'm with my niggas rollin' in this whip, it's stolen
Off a fifth of Hogan, if you chick is scoldin'
The whip get open and your bitch get open
Shit, this shit is sinister, ain't it ironic
My pops was a minister, nigga
For that side, I will ride, I will finish a nigga
Catch them how I rolled 'em
Shootin' photos of the job, hold it
Young Fargo, I'm just tryna let it all go, listen
Same clothes on me for a week straight
Pray the Lord help me for my peep's sake
When my mama died, I became a soldier
Papa couldn't save him, I was out there gettin' paper, hol' up
Lil sister cryin', she got multiple structures
Takin' needles every night just to hold a discussion
You don't know that pain nigga you don't know that rain
Beggin' niggas for they change, you don't know that shame
You never fucked up on a re-up you don't know that change
Walkin' in The Dot, nigga, you ain't show that chain
You ain't sleep in no park, you had a home to stay
I was down and dirty, tryna get a pound of 30
Niggas hated on me, threw dirt on my name
There's hurt in my veins, lightin' this purple the flame
I'm confused in this lost world
My daddy's daughter was a lost girl
And she my sister, she love me when I was younger
And told me fuck with the music
Instead of holdin' my gun up
She told me that maybe if I prayed
He gon' bring the sun up for me

You know, sometimes I wanna argue with these niggas
Then I call my bank teller and she say the balance
It's over
Uh, I'm talkin' 40 days, 40 nights
All a nigga got is God up on these hopeless nights
14 and homeless, tryna find an open bite
Scopin' out the open public, rollin' with this open stomach
Fiends on the work phone, ex on my other jack
Said come home, but she don't know I need this hundred stack
I ain't even comin' back, I'ma be here all night
Son up in her stomach, I'm like it's gon' be a long night
I remember dark nights, hallways and hard white
Schemin' like, "Might get that Rari with the fog lights"
I'ma be a don, black statues on the lawn
Used to stress when I was sleepin' on a mattress at my mom's
Momma died and now I'm sleepin' on a mattress all alone
In the O's with three niggas, I ain't barely even know 'em
When I had my coldest winters, it was barely even snowin'
OGs tell me chill, they don't barely even know 'em
First D.D. got locked and Shoakes got locked
Mo and Brooks tried to flee but they both got knocked
Shit was real on the field, I was sayin' through the grape vine
Pour a fifth of Henny for my niggas doin' state time
Niggas tryna keep the shine from me, I'ma take mine
Been the underdog, so I'm doin' over state grind
I pray to Lord I never drop dead
If I show up in that drophead
Foreign with the doors pointed at the top ledge, I'm a boss
Lil' nigga, big body, hoppin' out the Porsche
Now in Neiman Marcus, we ain't gotta shop at Ross
Feds for the bottles, how we came and copped the charge
Whoa, look, hype change, dice games
She just snap a photo for that light fame
And I was sellin' quarters for that ice chain
'Til I found God and my life changed
Sittin' on the block right now, I was tryna get change
A nigga need God right now, way more than ever
Smokin' on strong I been goin' hard all day long

Ich bin gestolpert, mein Drink auf dein Kleid
Und es tut mir leid, doch vielleicht soll es so sein
Vielleicht hatte ich einfach zu viel Jägermeister drin
Doch so ist das Leben, Baby - jeder fällt mal hin
Und ich weiß nicht wohin mit mir selbst
Wenn ich seh', wie du tanzt, du bist wunderschön
Mir wird heiß, mir wird kalt
Deine Schenkel, das Fleisch, Baby, einfach so unverschämt
Bitte lass mich nicht hier heute Nacht
Komm, wir geh'n bisschen raus, eine Runde dreh'n
Vielleicht bist du spontan und wir sind schon am Strand
Wenn die Sonne wieder untergeht
Wir werden's nie erfahr'n, wenn wir's nicht probier'n
Denn keiner von uns weiß, wohin die Reise geht
Also bitte lass agier'n und nicht diskutier'n
Baby, ist das hier für immer oder bleibt's ein Date?
And if you want me
And if you let me love you now
It's true what I need
Is someone for love me right now
It's true I'm a freak
It's time to love you now
And if you want me
I'm falling
Everyone falls in love sometimes

Tory’s Girlfriend: Nah, you ain’t going no where, like your not, your notSecond cycle, the kid is movin' like Billy Idol
With some past due W's that I'm still entitled
City love me I treat it like it's a bridal
Tux black as the strap I'm using to hit the rival
Last album was great but I know this one is greater
I made it this far as a great tastemaker without a spread from Complex and them covers that come in from FADER
I'm at tables with mans you love it
Fuck it, I made it from buckets
Slept in the rugged seats of a Civic
To walking through the city and niggas screaming I did it
I spit this shit from way back for 'em
This for niggas that told me, "I'll come back" but never came back for 'em
Loyal to them so I wait back for 'em like they my niggas
Knowin' they isn't, these niggas so insufficient
When we was both dealing, I used to throw in the pigeon
I guess, that mean nothing when niggas start coexisting
I done lost some good girls and niggas that I would cope with
Been backstabbed by niggas I used to smoke with
As far as rap I'm not the one to toe-to-toe with or go at it blow for blow with the silly shit no for no with
Money on the line, its money all on my mind
Calculating this vision, I sum it up for the grind
I promise when I got it I'd fuck it up for the times
Put 20k on the tab and buss it up every time, you get me?
In a Bentley smokin' on a fat 20, jealous niggas don't offend me, Dior dripped in the Fendi
I do it for the family OGs that never sent me on mission when I was down to put clip in and leave it empty and work
I ain't trippin' 'bout who got at me and dissed
I'm blessed, when I think about who shot at me and missed
I came from real situations
Niggas got clapped for little insinuations, time and impatience
Been grindin', finding my way in so much bros like the Wayans
Sometime it weigh me down whenever they try weigh in
In the day out, in the day in, shooters on say when
Niggas got clapped before the day end
The city I come from, taught me that there's nothing to run from
It taught me get my money in lump sums
So 'til that day, still at war, I'm still at pay
Never change boy, we still that way
It's young FargoAye, aye, aye

Got rid of some niggas, they mood, I couldn't hang with 'em
Smile in my face, but them niggas was hidin' hate in 'em
Oh, no
Yeah, we was born champions
And we was turned soldiers
Somewhere encaged in the concrete jungle, we all lost touch
Head to the sky, back to the wall
Young and not fully prepared to understand the facts of it all
With starvation in our stomachs and concentration in our eyes
You see niggas deprived of a life we thought was perfect
So what that mean is every scheme, hustle, and jugg is worth it until we murdered, nigga
No license, top down, you still pushin'

And anythin' I ever wanted she could make it real
Mama kept it so real
It's us against the world ,then we tell them, "Oh well"
I be like, "Oh, hell nah, you talk about my Mom?
It's about to be on in the schoolyard"
I gotta thank my mom for all the things she did
Sittin', reminiscin' on the things you said
If it was from my mama, never could go wrong
And that's the whole reason why I wrote this song, to say hey
Hey, thank you, mama
Thank you, mama
Hey, thank you, mama

I'm back on the road with a four and a baby
So baby just hit up my pager, nigga I'm major
This shit was a movie, I took her for sushi
My kick is front Louie, my chick outta truly
Your bitches are groupies, one of Wasatcha
My nigga book me the flight
I was gon' book her the ticket to fuck her
But it only took me one night and I damn near
Head in a Porsche I crashed the Panamera
I ain't got a damn care cause I'm the man in here
Walking with the metal cause the mofucking devil
Ain't playing it fair, I throw a damn chair
Liquor and the weed got me looking like a nigga with a blank stare
I'm in the bank yeah, every time I step up in your city
I'm the nigga getting banked out, I said I said it before
She getting me high but give me head on the low
I been getting the dough but really getting it though
Got the KDE moving and that's a cheddar to go
I b-redded flow enough finesse on the low
You can never nigga when I'm coming all up in it
Niggas talk money but it's funny to me
They don't see me like the car tinted
 Everything I'm doing gotta have an R in it
Audemar, Audecar, authentic
The streets wanna know why you and Drizzy Drake
Ain't been doing no features
I'm not for the answers the only thing I am is ready when he is
In living Jesus I nailed 'em my keeper to help me spit ether
My women let Bellevardé spill on designer they know I got cleaners
Fuck with me shawty, if it ain't me then who else?
We learned it from early don't bite off the hand
That's gon' feed you some wealth
Killer on the street, I preach and I repeat
No slip I sleep, I creep with my heat
Ice deep, even on my street with my peep the nigga might try pre-or
Got off a tour, 'bout to go hop on another one
Tell a fuck nigga to fall back 
Just like the summer done
Said it when I was eleven when I put the pen into the pad
Like Paramedic Pat, now we pull up pressing 
We done took an interception
Jugging in a cooking section, niggas took it that you took a lesson
But I didn't 
And you know the mofucka in the hood
Rapping like a mofucking hood reverendFull lyrics to be added soon.....

Way too much to drink
Just saying what I thinkKissing me goodnight with the saliva
Dried up on your lips like our love
Should've left the second that I knew you're already gone
Crying to me like I shouldn't blame you
Begging me to stay like I'm the one
Choosing someone else when that's all you've ever done
I'm suffocating while you're taking my pain just like it's yours
And I'm silent while you're crying
'Cause you're feeling it all and now I can't feel nothing
Numb
You're feeling it all and now I can't feel nothing
Numb
Won't let you cry no more
You're feeling it all and now I can't feel nothing
Numb
Numb to you , I'm numb to you
I done had a lot of drinks and I can't undo 'em
We've got boundaries and we about to run through 'em
Things in the dark, brought the sun to 'em
And all I found was the lies that you once threw
I hope you feel the same way I feel 'bout you
L-O-V-E, yeah, I fell out of
You know me please don't try to doubt it
Said I'd be out if you went scouting
Look what you did, you took it all
You went around, gave it to everybody
But me baby, how'd you do it?
Look what I did, I thought that I loving you down
But only I got hurt in doing what you're doing 
How could I be stupid enough to let you come up in my life
With all that I need? 
How'd you doubt me?
Prolly you and all without me but now you gon' see I'm
Numb
You're feeling it all and now I can't feel nothing 
Numb
Won't let you cry no more
You're feeling it all and now I can't feel nothing
Numb
Numb
Can’t feel nothing
I hope you feel the same way I feel bout you
L-O-V-E
Yeah, I fell out of, phone lit up but it stay on silent
You gon' see how you made me
Numb
You're feeling it all and now I can't feel nothing 
Numb
Won't let you cry no more
You're feeling it all and now I can't feel nothing
Numb14 kicked out on my own
Ain't shit for a nigga in the world
'Cause when you in a single parent home
Money the motive and nigga you ain't thinkin' 'bout a girl
When the day turn dark and the night come
The pain cut deep and it might run
Try to hide it all and ya light somethin'
Hopin' that the feelin' there might numb
But it don't and it won't
Ever ever ever go the fuck away
When you livin' on the street for another day
Dead broke thinkin', "Man, it's gotta be another way"
Tryna get a job but it don't go
Tryna build money when it don't grow
Kinda feel funny when you don't got funds
And you tryna cop a crib, it's a no go
Find life gettin' all loco
And you're livin' all low pro
And you still need a roof-in
So you move in with three niggas that you don't know
A little spot downtown
In the city, life with a twist
You spendin' every night gettin' pissed
And you find the true meanin' of life is a bitch
Black male, black male
Young Canadian black male
Livin' in the motherfuckin' slum
I figured I would make crack sell
Too bad that didn't work
But bein' in the back didn't work
And music, it wasn't in the plans
I was like, "Yeah right, like that's getting heard"
I locked up, niggas started robbin'
I fucked up, niggas I was robbin'
Got fucked up for the niggas I was robbin'
Just some little fucked up niggas that was mobbin'
I tried to invest in a gun
Bad outcomes destined to come
Mom died, Dad cried
Dad tried to do the best for his son
Well send the things we're gone, pop
'Cause everything went wrong, pop
And even though I took the long way
I guess I really had to learn the hard way huh, pop
It beats me
But the hatin' ain't gon' grease me
So I roll the pain in these streets
'Cause it's way too hard to sleep sweet
This ain't an act nor a story
This a chapter of Tory
And what's after the story
Hand claps and the glory
That's when it got bad for me
So hows that for a story?
Not bad, but guess what
This ain't even half of my storyIt's love, we just caught in the moment
Swavey, baby, yeah
Say you're frustrated, baby
Your main game, you do it right
I get so impatient, baby
Thinkin' 'bout you tonightt

With a mink on and four fingers that my rings on
Quick drawin' like you don't know where my dick going
Like I ain't been up in your chick dorm since the flip phones
My ice rocky, nice jocky
So much maple leaf money, niggas think I'm playing ice hockey
I'm that fly type, move through the night cocky
Bitch, I look so good, even the dykes watch me
I'm on indictment with a bad lightskin
Chain rain so much water they think we 'bout to have lightning
When I spit, niggas think I'm in that lab fightin'
Niggas think that I'm left hooking and I'm jab writin'
One thing is, I ain't in that lab writin', nigga everything is off top
Word to my bald spot
I used to have to stash work in my broad spot
Cops came, had to stash work in the bra strap
Phone calls and my connect is just a call drop
We don't count down on those, that's a ball drop
Come on akh, pretendin' y'all niggas on block
Twin fives put like ten of y'all niggas on shots
We could do it however y'all niggas wan' rock
Make this shit pop like oil in a chrome pot
And it don't stop
I'm not a picture painter but I will put a nigga in his own chalk
I let the .9 spill
I got a ill lil' shooter out in Brownsville down for the wild deal
I'll feel blessed if nigga test and my shooter leave him streched 'til the bones in his spine chill
I'm ill nigga, this is not a time drill
I used to serve on the strip and watch Seinfield
Man, I remember serving on the strip
Watching out for cops hoping out suburbans on the strip
Working on the strip, chilling with a .30 on my hip
Whole team of shooters, bunch of Steph Curries in my clique
Boy, I'm a wild boy, check the style, boy
I'm a real baller, you a towel boy
I'll put 'em in the future, no Elroy
'Cause I pop tops like I'm opening some Altoids
Breath minty and fresh Fendi
Got a hustler chick down to smuggle bricks through the West Indies
I'll hustle 'til it's nothing left in me, and the plug hear 'bout me and gotta invest in me
I send semi's at any nigga that's testin' me
I'm prayin' to the lord, he's the one that been blessing me
But yo, I got a sick set
And my jewels like dipset
And we on cam like dipset
These fuck niggas say they coming for the kid neck?
Give you dog shots like I'm checking in a sick pet
Got street ties with the street guys
Even if they fly on G5s, they'll kill you for a G5
Fifteen hunnid, my FN gunning
My dawg copped twenty birds, and they just keep coming
He sold four and plus he let a sick team run 'em
We ain't talking 'bout a verse when it's a sixteen coming 
I'm a real nigga
I keep a Tommy on my body but when you see me, I ain't wearin' Hilfigher
Just a ladder and a roofer that'll drill niggas
And down to take his charge when he kill niggas
Look, I'm the hot kid in the school
I pull up to the party and I pop chicks in the pool
Hot chicks say I'm hot and my dick is a jewel
Just let me box with that twat, I'll stick it and move
Yo, she like the way my wrist dance
She like the way the wrists on my fist dance
Every time a nigga switch hands
And my guns and shooters on quickstands
You would thinks the guns designer, they way they come in rip pants
Wrist cuts, my wrist slants and I'm in the truck getting jiggy, tryna get up in your chick pants
Bitch dance
It's four hoes with me, if them four hoes did me, shawty, it won't be a fifth chance
My whole stretch from south France to Brisbane
And they attached to the arms like wrist bands
Look, I send 'em up and I'ma send a  back if they sent 'em up
My dawg got a twenty on him and a semi tucked
But, I've been in so many life or death situations, I just wanna live it up
I dropped it off and I picked it up
And my Joels all Embiided and I'm feeling all sixered up
I'm in the club tryna find a thick chick to fuck
Man, after all my neck and wrist is all glittered up
Bitches wanna fuck it up, now they want to lick it up
They man hear about it next day and wan' get me touched
In a Bentley, tints tucked, Cuban linked up
Big chain on me in case I gotta get you inked up
Wrink up, see the wrist roller wrinked up
Whole squad looking like we robbed us a Brink's truck
Any cat that know Lanez know I'm worldwide
I leave you on your sweatshirt like Earl died
I'm more wavy than a surfer on a curl tide
And you a bitch, even lookin' from your girl's eyes
I'm a stunna, my wrist done up, my girls got the scar tissue on her tits done up
Fucking with her, I'ma have to lift gun up and bang bang 'til the tissue on your hip come up
I'm a all around star player
I'm a lot of y'all father like Darth Vader
Fuck niggas know I charge for my hard labour
I spent nights in that cold for that hard paper
Listen, that's why I feel I'm the most hot in the place
A lot of niggas saying they hot but they not in the place
And your block? It ain't hot, man it's safe
Next nigga diss Tory Lanez 'bout to get shot in his face, nigga
I hate niggas that lie and move funny
That why keep fly and chill on the cruise money
Y'all niggas lose money, y'all niggas just snooze money
Just look at my blood, my shit is just ooze money
Look, I do this for that youngin' on the corner
That hustle all day though he never had a daughter
He never had a father, he hustle in the corner
I'm telling that he wilding tryna truck the shit to Florida
But niggas love to hustle, it's aura
When you come up from the poor, you struggle and you short
You gon' do it for mother, lost your brother to the force
So you in the only son to keep the loving in the core
Every day you ducking strays tryna run in to the store
And you can't afford a bed, layin' covers on the floor
And you momma's stressing and her blood pressure getting lower
And your daughter want that brand new toy
But it's hard to show her that you broke and can't afford it
So you on the corner, niggas talking shit and the plug, he keep avoidin' ya
So you wanna hustle and you tryna get your coin up
Out there on your own, but shit, Satan will corner ya
So you wanna own, tryna get your own up
Now I'm on my own, I'm just tryna get my own up
Had to come through, 54, bought the chrome up
Niggas tried to hate, had to bring back the chrome up

My Canada niggas
It’s the realest shit I ever wrote
It’s the illest shit she’ll ever quote
Uh, I know these niggas love to hate me but fuck it, I’m with it
I’m running the city!
A buck fifty for them bitches were a bucket of fifty
Swiss cheese for some niggas I’m fucking with swiftly
And break bread with all them niggas is hustling with me
I know the feeling I felt it before feeling it
Screw fake city I felt it before grilling it
I grew up fast, too much cash
In the brain of this nigga, that ain’t blew up fast
I send prayers to my mom though, my mind on the dime though
I’mma keep kickin', till I’m looking like Rolando
Stress is my feeling, cause I’m feeling it’s my time though
Knowing I’mma kill it, I’m the illest from my time bro
Time zone, time switch, I get grind, get money and a mind switch
I’m in a mosh pit, with no money, so hungry than a live pit
Before the country I rap it cause it’s my shit
I, guess I'm seeing how you niggas get
If I was on my face, you wouldn’t give a nigga shit
So fuck you all young owe a nigga enough
And everybody’s selling dreams and most of the niggas bluffing
Ain’t gotta brag, and boast a nigga, I’m coming
They know what they’re fucking fear
They show it all in the public
Yeah, but I can see them through my third eye
We gonna be on top, shots watching from the bird’s eye
View from the school, no rules where the birds lie
I was in the basement, trying to get the words out
All the brothers locked up for trying to put some birds out
Million on this case they was trying to bring the herd out
He tried to feed his family, trying to see a Grammy
Working so hard, I ain’t got time to see my family
Niggas on the B role, they’ll be fucking with me
That if I don't make this rapping they go back to selling kilos
You gotta understand that a nigga like me I was raised where
If you got a beef, you throw the hands back
Fuck what your man’s at!
If it’s going down, it’s right now for the hand clap
You down, and you staring back, back to my bullshit
Used to chill with niggas that was strapped with a full clip
Squad up type niggas, started problems over bullshit
But he never caught up, look how he was brought up
Stay up on your feet, cause the closest niggas harm ya
Breaking the alarms up, we was doing bad like there was no such thing as karma
Shout my nigga, that’s the way, he didn’t have no armor
Had my nigga, Big leaning like he was out from....
I can’t see it any further
Lot of single mothers, I ain’t seeing any fathers
She don't see either
Maybe on the weekend, if you see some cooking decent, and
He'll probably call her, and she'll probably spoil him, and
Been rich, went broke, then rich again
With all that I’ve seen and found a lot of missing friends, niggas
That was just pretend, fuck the bails, skip the pen
Riding like District 10, a hundred bands just to spin
Rumor a nigga whispering, what’s a nigga whispering
To a mother fucker that ain’t listening, and bitches just
Jump on a nigga dick, ride it cause a nigga sick
Then the buzz dying, all the mother fucking bitches dip
I don’t give a fuck now, made a nigga numb now
Bitch who’s going dumb, and I’ll never plan the dumb down
I face it, going harder, then it’s bass and its sounds fair
Let the game play and I'll make a goal like a touch down!
I put that on Syriah, I’m on fire
Get a mother fucking grip, nigga bald tire
Fuck these nigga and these bitches, they are all liars
But got niggas and some bitches, nigga bonfires
Yeah, and I'm forever on some fly shit
I’mma draw the line, you niggas pick who you gonna ride with
Shot goes out to Nipsey, I fuck with you for fucking with me
Half of niggas is pussies, you pussy niggas is dickies
Hickies left on my neck from a bitch, I swear that she get me
Me and her both know that she only here for my Benjies
Roldses, Benzes, and Bentleys
Politics couldn't prevent me
So all you niggas resent me for all the hate that you send me
But, it's okay though, I only came up
Sense for the future, back in high school
Teachers called me a looser
Cause she thought that I was focused on banging, soo woopin'
Fuck you for not using
The better side of you and judging the young nigga
With dreams and aspirations for making my funds bigger
Aye, a lot of things I had to figure out
So fake shit don’t ever come about this nigga mouth!
Nigga, Canada! Aha! Live nigga trying to shit on me, it’s all good nigga

I ask you look down upon me with mercy and judge me not by the crimes I commit, but by the character of my heart. Feel the conflicts in my soul. As of this moment, I pray that you guard with with protection. If it's gon' be my day to leave this earth by your will, I sincerely repent and accept you as my saviour

Sometimes I feel like other guys be dissin' you
And we just don't do the same things we used to
So tonight girl, I'm gonna do something you ain't used to
Tonight, girl take off your clothes
Up against the door
And it will take all night, all night
Tonight, girl take off your clothes
Down against the floor
And it will take all night, all night long
Baby girl, you're on my mind
Got me spendin' all my time
So after we get done and all the fun is gone
I could be a thousand miles away and still rememberin' our love
So baby girl, take that jacket off
And shawty, ain't no way I'm backin' off
Ain't nothin' that can stop this crazy feelin'
Ain't nothin' that can stop the way I'm feelin'
Tonight, girl take off your clothes
Up against the door
And it will take all night, all night
Tonight, girl take off your clothes
Down against the floor
And it will take all night, all night long
Just the way you make it whine
You got me spendin' my time
Girl, you do what you do and you do whatever it is that you do to me
Girl, it's you on my mind all the time and I'm never thinkin' 'bout it usually
It be like, oh baby girl
Oh oh baby girl
So after we get done and all the fun is gone
I could be a thousand miles away and still rememberin' our love
Tonight, girl take off your clothes
Up against the door
And it will take all night, all night
Tonight, girl take off your clothes
Down against the floor
And it will take all night, all night long
Tonight, girl take off your clothes
Up against the door
And it will take all night, all night
Tonight, girl take off your clothes
Down against the floor
And it will take all night, all night longTell me what happened to us?
Mishaps, the trust, the laughs, the love, couple things we ain't doing now
I hear you say you movin' on and you movin' out
Its like we been in jail, I ain't know you was out
Say you want some new shit, you chuckin' your deuces
I'm like "Who are you Chris?" girl, you know that's foolish
I feel the rougher we come, fuck it, the lovin' is done
Chuck it up in a bums bucket and cover with gum
Lucky I'm a rugged brother, feel like the lovin' was fun
Now it's done, send it back, give up and refund
See the thing about love is it comes when it comes
But when it leaves, it'll hurt like a cut in the gums
No jumpin' the gun, think you've paired up with the one
Until one day she had enough, it's fed up and it's done
So don't ever take for granted what your mind feel
Remember she can be the one but only time tells
Said I'ma write it down, hopin' you reply
I'ma throw it up, throw this to the sky
Now it's floatin' up, look at where it fly
Look at who we were, look at who we are now
I wish we could fly
I wish I could take you up and fly
And this my notice to the sky
I'm just gon' throw it up and hope it lands in front of you
This is about us, this is about trust
This isn't about lust or none of that other stuff
This is is about truth, whenever truth occurs
Do you have the courage to tell the truth instead of words?
I dislike liars, I'm just like Mia, you get the best of me and I just might fire
And it's the main reason I can't give you all my feelings or nothin'
I feel like you frontin', I feel like you be dealin'
With somethin' that got nothin' to do with me
And look what you do to me, try to give you a truer me
But you was just foolin' me
I guess the fool is me and little foolish me
I was just tryina make it better for you and me
And what I couldn't see is that me and you
Will never ever be who we use to be
And I took for granted what my mind told
I had to sit and let it happen and only time told, Swavey
Said I'ma write it down, hopin' you reply
I'ma throw it up, throw this to the sky
Now it's floatin' up, look at where it fly
Look at who we were, look at who we are now
I wish we could fly
I wish I could take you up and fly
And this my notice to the sky
I'm just gon' throw it up and hope it lands in front of youMs. Backseat Love

Lyrics By: SumanStudiosAyo, Ciravo, man
I done talked to like 10 of my producers
And none of them can make this beat
So I'm gon' make it myself
Let's try somethin' out man
Let's just beat box it out
Like the old school days
Swavey
You know you fine with them Hello Kitty PJ's on
And when you walkin' in the room, girl, you ain't even wrong
You got your hair twirled down to the side, babe
And love to brush it when you talkin' on your Skype, babe
Ooh girl, won't you let me see it?
Let me come over when you layin' in the Vicky Secrets
Said I been feenin' all day, won't you let me beep it?
And we ain't gotta tell nobody, it's our little secret
You say you ain't dressed up
But you ain't gotta dress up
And when you got no make up on
Girl, I just wanna take you on
'Cause she got that T-shirt on with the slides
Rock the swim pants with the hair tied
So got her Uggs on, on the phone
Girl, you're so comfortable and fly
I love it when you're comfortable, girl
You're comfortable, girl
I love it when you're comfortable, girl
You're comfortable, girl
I love it when you're comfortable, girl
Hol' up, now this one is strictly for the ladies
Let me ask y'all somethin'
I said do you, do you, do you like to be comfortable?
I said do you, do you, do you like to be comfortable?
'Cause she got that T-shirt on with the slides
Rock the swim pants with the hair tie
She got her Uggs on, on the phone
Girl, you're so comfortable and fly
I love it when you're comfortable, girl
You're comfortable, girl
I love it when you're comfortable, girl
You're comfortable, girl
I love it when you're comfortable, girl
Baby, yeah, Swavey, baby
There's nothin' better than you when you're comfortable, baby

Well uh, we gon' sign off, this has been a Lanez creation
Produced by Lanez
Yo Sauce, I made it a reality, playboy

I pull up to the dealer, buy any car in it
Bitches sayin', "Aw yeah" 'cause I'm Authentic
Gotta make 100 more, yeah 'cause I'm gon' get it
Motherfucker stylish, I be shoppin' in Thailand
Women takin' pictures like a nigga hop out the fire
Tryna get paper like niggas made it up out of college
Yo chick be on my dick, I ball like a set of eye lids
I just be like pull up you bitches, hoodlums and bullet shit pictures
Y'all wanna fuck with a nigga, pushups and pullups you bitches

Cops comin', had to tell em put the top down

That DAB tryna get me, go fetch this weed that we're givin'
I be that nigga you notice, so shit these bitches the notice
Bitches of mixin' the moment, pictures yo bitch when I'm bonin'
And the whole room full of drugs
Whole corner niggas camouflaged
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me
Bitch, shut the fuck up when you talk to me
I'm fuckin' awesome
I'm fuckin' awesome
I'm fuckin' awesome
Come on nigga, you won't beat me up nigga, you just BMW nigga. The fuck wrong with you? My bitch don't push my buttons, nigga. The only buttons she push is the ones that stole them cars, nigga
Could tell you all you need to know, I'm gon' say
I've never got dropped, had to drop 
You ain't want to flex, I got people on the Tecs
Swavey on the T's, got the sneakers comin' next
Just so I can ball, I went and bought me a Rawling, nigga
Gettin' closer to gold and weigh up out of this song
Play like you got that hate like when we be cakin' in Jordans
Niggas hatin', ain't no fuckin' talkin' in this star, nigga
You don't wanna fuck around, get your life tooken
Uh uh fuck around, get your wife tooken
Black Phanton in the night lurkin'
Like a black plane with a flight bookin'
Okay, I just bought a Rollie, plus the Phantom and parolies
Niggas yeah, they can't stand, I'm on the man, they wanna know me
Holy Bible by my bed, I keep that rifle by my head
Niggas find me, I'm gon' let it through, I'm grimey on the grit and that for real, nigga
And the whole room full of drugs
Whole corner niggas camouflaged
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me
Bitch, shut the fuck up when you talk to me
I'm fuckin' awesome
I'm fuckin' awesome
I'm fuckin' awesome
You know what I'm sayin', nigga? Niggas can't fuck with us, just hatin' ass niggas so we fuck. I got a Persian rug for every bad bitch I got. Fuck is wrong with you niggas, man? CanadaPass the weed. Ay nigga, ay you seen that bitch Chloe upstairs, nigga? Bitch was damn near dancin' on my leg, nigga. Ay, ay kill that shit. Now who the fuck is that over there? That don't look like Gotti car? That is that nigga shit. These niggas tryna ride on us, nigga. Fuck that. Hey everybody take your positions, I gotta get my shit upstairs, man. Hey, T Ray, you comin' with me, man. Thes niggas ain't finna fuckin' ride on us
As I stand here in this fuckin' mirror
Pistol in my hand, it’s nothin' but bloody stairs
Cold glasses, watchin' up in the stairs
They watchin' from a corner, cops hop the blocks on her
I tried to make paper, was makin' the block warmer
Aroma of gettin' cake and chasin' cash, tag laser like
I got a stripper that’s workin' for good dollars
I predict myself later in life for some good father
Conflicts of a nigga, so I feel it
Shit I ever wrote, I bet this probably be the realest
And this population full of highly poppin' armadillos
It’s only gettin' realer but these niggas never book 'em
Back in my days, we sold drugs and never took 'em
But look what it’s comin' into
I’m livin' in a war and got pussy up on my mental
Niggas murdered my cousin in front of my grandmother, you the one that had vent to
When rappers got the nerve to make you kill, it’s uneventful
Fuckin' murderer, rappers find you and murder you
That could change me to the same word that I heard you were
But I don’t care about the cycle though
I’m 'bout to lift 'em in the air like you’re Michael yo
A pair of Jordans, black clothin', the Air Forces
Woke up leanin' somethin' like I pad noxious
Fuck the clutch and grab the Nina and that new tutu
Pulled it out from under the sweater and tu tu tuf
Niggas, young ringin', gun singin' like
Young ringin', gun singin' like
Still in shock, never ran up off the block
'Til I felt the shot nearly ring across my top
100 meter dash was the way I start to drop
Thinkin' at my thoughts like damn, man I shot
Another nigga, could’ve been some niggas’ pops
Or brother nigga, hustle figure, help a nigga’s guap more
Wasted out was niggas, been addicted to this pot
Instead of gettin' guap, niggas got evicted from the spot
Could’ve picked the lock, should’ve been a nigga but I’m not
That ignorant just figured that this bickerin' will stop
Liquor run this shot, gotta get my mind off that
Back on guard, my mind on track
Livin' a life of sellin' drugs to niggas gettin' signed off rap
Wasn’t in my plans, neither was this gun up in my hand
But you know how niggas get, not knowin' why niggas weird
And niggas is old and stupid, always doin' hot nigga shit like
Fuck 'em, can’t without 'em, I duck 'em
I figured that if them niggas is with you, there ain’t no trust in you
You love' em from a distance, doin' thug don’t go with niggas
'Cause that could be your greater reason why you’re here in prison
See first 48, I seen the closest niggas snitchin'
And since then, I ain’t been provokin' niggas when they see
I rather can and deal your man the handle on my business then
Dip into the light like I was damn near fishin', gang
Ay, fuck out, fuck out, nigga. Ay Tory, Tory nigga. Get the fuck in the car, we gotta get the fuck up outta here. Shit. Fuck man, these niggas got Mugz and Bogs, my nigga. God fuck. Shit. Ay my nigga, ay nigga, wake the fuck up right now, my nigga. I feel like I'm havin' a prophecy or somethin', nigga. Nigga, Mugz and Bogs ain't get a second chance, nigga but we did. We gotta make it straight with God, nigga. Shit, we don't even know if it's gon' be a second chance next time, Tory. Ay Tory, ay wake the fuck up, my nigga. ToryShe know how I do

Uh, y'all can't be that nigga for too long
Been smokin' loud then got these bitches on the bong
She fucked around and landed in the place of G niggas
I push that six, don't blow my shit out the street, nigga
I keep figures big as the shits I'm takin' on motherfuckers
Just wait, I got my paper straight, I make this motherfucker
Wit' all my niggas, bottled liquor for my favorite women
Don't hate, I make your chick undress to meet my favorite linen
Been in different situations wit' different types of women
She know this life I live excitin', plus I ball like ain't no type of spendin'

Try to enjoy the moments I won't get again
After graduation, when time goes past, remember me for long
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do they go?
You know what I'm sayin'
She comin' down real clean on 'em shit
Memories are just wrong, me and my niggas holdin'
Smokin' loud in the parkin' lot, tryna chap teens and enroll
Little niggas just gettin' it, pool party we dip in it
17 and I'm extra leanin' and no model chick stand next to me
I'm in there, swimmin' wear 'til the lights out and it's dim next
My niggas sayin it's fuck that, I hit the jam and take bus back
Nigga, 9th grade was all that, skippin' class with no hall pass
I had a crush on lil Kiki but that damn girl ain't never call back
And we so young
You and I get higher then a fuckin' tube sock
We hit the west to 2Pac
And I wish I can get this fuckin' pictures in 'cause they gone
Let's leave the past behind the master mind of love
Try to enjoy the moments I won't get again
After graduation, when time goes past, remember me for long
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do they go?
This that SLS nigga

I remember tellin' Keisha put that ass on the floor
Lil nigga rolling', whip stolen, hands on my dope

Star nigga O'Brian, bad bitches on my end
Two 50 for the bus fare, I'm fresh as swave so it's fuck yeah

Bitch, don’t get it twisted 'cause a nigga out here singin', I’ll just split you in yo shit
Pilin' money to the ceilin', I can’t fuck with no bitch
Since a bitch fucked up my business, now I’m stuck with a lick
Gettin' riches like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
But the pussy was my sweetest joy, then I done caught a bullet
Nigga, let's get rich and fuck these bitches when they come
I'm grippin' .5, thinkin' 'bout these niggas switchin' sides
Gettin' high just to ease the pain
When all of your people done changed
The same people that claimed to bang
Once you do whatever things you do you gave it to this game
Well change the thoughts and minds that niggas is fakin' and snakin' and lyin'
And makin' 'em wanna get all on yo' side, my God
Protect my soul through all this madness
Heaven's contradictions, all these demons talkin' fictions
Talkin' 'bout how they gon' get and give me light
I know this ain’t right, all these women try
I know this ain’t life, still I’m gettin' high

Looking around, and you're no where to be found
Searching high and low, I feel like my eyes go
Anywhere the wind blows
Am I too late to show up?
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
No, my
Stole my heart
Stole my heart, heart
And this is the part where you think you found her but really you never found her
You found out you didn't need her, instead of lovin', you leave her
And wound up cuffin' some 22 year old whose name is Lisa
And found out Lisa don't need you but keep you just for the reason
She couldn't get over Paul who's 20 studyin' law
And gettin; that major paper and pushin' the latest Range
And lately you made a change 'bout how you claimin' your dame
You found out Lisa ain't it and you want that love to remain
But who you came into shit with but fuck it you such a nimwit
You loved her she fuckin' missed it, you lied she upd and listened
Goodbye as you uppedd and kissed him, she tried but you upped and dissed her
So why is the fuckin' question and why is you fuckin' stressin?
You need it back, but she disagree with that
See while you was cheatin', chasin', yeah she was out rereplacin'
Findin' another lover that someone won't keep her waitin'
So she got on the ball, and met this nigga named Paul, who Lisa chasin'
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
No, my
Stole my heart
Stole my heart, heart
Looking around, and you're no where to be found
Searching high and low, I feel like my eyes go
Anywhere the wind blows
Am I too late to show up?SLS 'til the death
Warner Brother forever
And shout out to Kids
Trill girl Camillo
I ride for my niggas, dawg
I ride for my niggas
.45 on my niggas, sold
.45 on my niggas
Stay schemin', niggas tryna fuck my bitch
Damn, life so long
Fuck her, she ain't wanna hit the bong
Fuck it, I got bunches for the next bitch
Drip drippin' on the dick like it's Nesquik
I had your bitch doin' somersaults
All my motherfuckin' life, I been an underdog
All my motherfuckin' life, I been an underdog
All my motherfuckin' life, I been an underdog
All my, all my, all my-my-my
All my motherfuckin' life, I been an underdog
That's why I gotta stack this paper 'fore the summer, dawg
Big dick on your chick tit like a underbra
Vegas with my top hoe, drop top with the top
Chop plates, slop slow, tell a hater lock load
He can keep grillin' 'cause them killers on the top floor
Tatted like a botso
It's one tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor her, baby, this is shot four
Got this bitch jumpin' like I'm standin' on the hop floor
Spittin' like a snot nose, sneeze on the drop rose
Niggas lookin' hungry and the cheese like a pot roast
Young niggas with the shit
Got these niggas pissy that this young nigga gettin' it
I keep tryin' ball out, keep sharin' bitches
'Cause with bitches, niggas fall out
Been a situation, that niggas had to crawl out
Niggas talkin' tougher when you seein' them stall out
Phoney ass hoe tryna ball out
Shit, I can say that they inspire me
But for what they are, not these niggas that they tryna be
I love life, nigga
Bandana tie like thug life, nigga
Murder on the track just because, my nigga
Then I kill that shit, that's enough life, nigga
Ladies and gentlemen, I did my little thing but it's not about me right now. It's about my older brother in this motherfucker,  Sos Couture. So give it up for the man I'm about to let out of the motherfuckin' cage and let's get nasty
I had the block doin' backflips
Make crack flip and hallways that smelled like cat piss
Pass packs to bad kids who had dreams
Of pushin' fast whips that would attract fast checks
I hustle, hustle so suffer from havin' to watch shit
Cold nights consisted of frost bitten fingers and cracked lips
Weekends in Hawaii and I spend it all at Saaks 5th
Didn't save for dimes 'cause at the time to see my lacked sense
Though I could account for everywhere that them packs went
I wasn't tryna rap sickles, I was tryna wrap bricks
3 Os in one night, called that the hat trick
3 hoes in one night, called that the hat trick
Model my stories if I told you my story
My guts and glory, that have you flabbergasted
Take a long puff of the pushin' pinger and pass it
Tryna live life to the fullest, tryna pass on the casket
8 balls served, no ragged
Cops on my ass tryna break up my rackin'
Ratchet 'cause I hit the block, harder than a crackin'
Soldiers got to crack, right up and they crackin'
And make it all disappear in 10 minutes, that's magic
But the destruction of a young mom, that's tragic
But it all depends on whoever you askin'
The school teacher or the fiend in the street scratchin'
Thankin' my nigga Fresh, kicks plus 10
Fresh my nigga, I hate to, hate to be him
Bitch, you wasn't with my shittin' in the bed
Bitch, you wasn't with my shittin' in the bed
Gettin' hard up in the boulevard and even harder in the jail cell
Prosecution, lies and judge deny his bail
But my mind gets stronger as the time sells
Like they gave me time to realise where my crime fell
But a man to help, tryna sleep in the belly of the beast
Where I need me a seroquel
But even lookin' in the mirror kills
Shit, at times I give myself the chills, watchin' as the anger builds
But don't rush, I got my back to build
And my shoes laced, in the place where the wolves prey
Yeah, yeah
Yo man, leave it, lemme talk, lemme talk my shit, man. Give me a second. Y'all niggas, y'all niggas stay schemin', man. Y'all niggas stay plottin' on the real ones. Persons told you to motherfuckin' manage it. Somebody should have popped you right in the mouth the first time you put your hands in the cookie jar. Say I got the rhythm. One Umbrella. Canada. Sincerely Tory, March 26, my nigga. You already know what it is, it's Fres, don't make me put that in the end. Canada, Canada          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        Uh
I know we separated baby
Let me ask you one question though
I said "who am I?"
"Baby, what are you and I?"
We used to be suicide do or die
Never knew it that a newer guy, you would find
I figured I was on to the next one
But my heart, it was hard to forget one
Regrettin' every scar that I left, uh
I feel 'em when I pause, and the stress come
I was really in love with this girl, like
But keep it on some real shit
You was somebody that a brother could really deal with
The only woman I could chill with, and really chill with
Instead of tryna hit it real quick, real spit
Feel it
I guess I couldn't see it comin'
It's like a bill from the cab when the meter runnin'
I'm still feelin like I'm needin your lovin
Up in this race, girl you're keepin' me runnin'
But, fuck it, uh
I guess the lovin' is gone
Go with him but he ain't never gonna love you as strong
You, you, could never tell me that the lovin' was wrong
'Cause we both know that it took us to above and beyond
I, I, I'm still thinkin' that you must be the one
Look how you got me fucked up, look at what we become
But I ain't trippin' 'cause I knew that you done done what you done
And every relationship gotta be done when it's done, and I know
Sometimes I think, what if I was wrong?
Would I be sittin' here, writing out this song?
I know that sometimes I may have been wrong
But you gotta forgive me, yeah yeah
And I know that we both done made some mistakes
When I face it
All I want is you, you, you, you, you
Now that you're gone, ay
All I want is you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
Hey girl
All I want is you, you, you, you, you
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Don't leave me hangin' babe
Girl I need you
All I need is you, ohhhh
Babe
And Mr. Peterson drops
January 1st, 2011
Make sure you got that tape
It's gon' be a classic
So classicI just called to say hello
Remember me from junior high? Your little guy
Do you recall that beautiful note I wrote?
Said circle yes if you wanna be mine, all mine
Prom night, you were beautiful
You wore the heels with your dress, girl, you were fresh
But there's just one thing you should know, woah
Breakin' up with you, I do regret, oh I do regret
Hello, I just called to say hello
Hello, oh I'm just callin' your phone to say
Hello, girl, I just called you to say
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello today

Don't even remember the fight
The years have gone and time has grown
But you'll always be on my mind, my mind
Girl, you used to give me so much joy
I can't say I don't miss your laugh, your laugh, yeah
Passin' notes in all our class
Say, truth is, girl, I want you back, you back, you back
Hello, I just called to say hello
Hello, oh I'm just callin' your phone to say
Hello, girl, I just called you to say
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello todayIm tryin to run away from temptations, but the shit’s calling
I’m at the Ritz Carlton, sitting in this bitch balling
I know these women faking and still I can’t call it
They like you drive, but ain’t arrivin when your whip is stallin
I thought this fame shit would change shit
I turn around, I’m still surrounded by the same shit
I’m on a champagne sip, got the flame late still moving up
It’s open seas like the salve ship, buffling the plague click
You know you with the don its whatever
Lyrically im Kobe and Lebron put together
Niggas can’t accept it so they tell me that im soundin like
Uh, a bunch of rappers that dont sound alike
Fuck you, man, I’m off the subject
These niggers be faking, these bitches be hating
Shit, I’m about my budget
First class from the seven is filling the norms
Scotty Gripping balling win to my women is from
That’s why they love the dome
In house left the keys out and never know
Give me two bad bitches, I give my Elleanor
And some ice cold water to sip this lemon all
Fuck you niggers, you nigga’s about fifty
She’s skinny and gold jimmy
For you think you fuck strictly I’m here to get fucked quickly
Scar mouth, she got Mohawk and he thoughts
With a left dress, which body is the mess
Don’t be a dog, I can show you how I’m pimping
Rather leash neat this lifestyle when I’m limping
Rule number one, keep your head up in the wind
You gotta, gotta make some money, go bananas like it’s chimping
Folks don’t ever know, heard this pussy niggers hating, fuck, who ever do
Fly diva, I eat her if she had a boo, but she got to have millions, rapper villie on, stacks on zillion
You rolling with the state up next, ball met your face like a break up, nigga
And I see I’m trying to take up next, we gonna make a next call it jake out, nigga
We need to fight for, nigga, switch your side, tell me who you ride for
Do your verge, stop and turn it, nigga, fight for
Pump seven out of eleven bottle side shore
I got worry, we should kill it, nigga, why for?
Can in the stupid your level, I’m in the sky more
I’m in the Louie V style, shit is Gucci guitar
I’m meaning Suzuki models give me Gucci a lot
Bitch, I’m mobbing through the mall, got trullies ‘em all
You’re telling get money, niggers, while I’m truly depart
Me and sun shine up a deal, best skin coping for another winning
Have ‘em like the track field how you run up in it
‘till it’s dead and finished, hop in mane and fuck it with it
Why is they fucking with me? On my shit, get off my dick
Don’t know what this money all mean
All I’m left and all I’m which, c’mon
Niggers still hating, c’mon
Niggers getting ready, c’mon
Why there is the begging, c’mon
C’mon, c’mon, c’mon
C’mon, c’mon, c’mon
C’mon, c’mon, c’mon
C’mon, c’mon, c’mon
C’mon, c’mon, c’mon
C’mon, c’mon
C’mon, c’mon
C’mon, c’mon
C’mon, c’mon
C’mon, don’t leave me alone
Babe, please, don’t leave me aloneHow do I tell you to when it's just all a lie?
I don't even need you now, feel like I'm living to stay
When we get closer, I love you
But when it's all over, don't love ya no more
I say fuck it's, it's fucked up
No baby, it's all fucked up
Don't even need to have to say go
Get your highs and your leather, take off
'Cause I just wanna take you there, baby
Let me take you there
Sextasy, you next to me
Love me down, I love the sound
You don't know what I can do with your body
You don't know just how I feel when you're naughty
When we get closer, I love you
But when it's all over, don't love ya no more
I say fuck it's, it's fucked up
No baby, it's all fucked up
Don't even need to have to say go
Get your highs and your leather, take off
You just wanna touch
Touch me, babe
Sextasy, you next to me
Love me down, I love the sound
Sextasy, you next to me
Love me down, I love the soundYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, look
Damn, won't you get her her paradise
Somethin' more than a store with a pair of Nikes
That we probably can't afford 'cause the wearin' price
So instead, we just window shop
At night time, gotta keep her windows locked
'Cause niggas outside with they things on cock
And money so low though, through they been throwin' rock
I heard he savin' up for that Benz old drop
But if cops knock 'em down and his ears gon' flop
So the ink from his pen gon' drop
'Cause when we do the crime, everythin's blown out
I help the portion, women havin' abortions
And we as black males should not be black male
We can make planes instead of them crack sales
Think about it, you ruinin' someone's life
And if they come back, you doin' it to 'em twice
Let's all to sleep
Just a dream a day
Way them clouds ain't grey
And you're miles away
So just let your head
Think away the pain
From your cloudy day
Because now you stay in a beautiful place
Damn, won't you give a man good livin'
Good cookin' that ain't comin' outta hood kitchen
Build a better community that we could live in
Give us better predicaments that we shoulda been in
I mean not all of us bad, some got a good vision
And our role models gettin' shot up in the hood slippin'
The fall out's appall seen
How do we graduate if drop outs all we see?
And when we sleep, the only time that we offer peace
Wish I could wake up and all my pain's all a dream
All as God's human beings, come all a team
Where everybody on the bus on the car to be
We need difference in the world, predominantly
Need change, more than an Obama speech
We need to listen like the times when our mama speaks
So we can finally expand like we oughta be, uh
Let's all to sleep
Just a dream a day
Way them clouds ain't grey
And you're miles away
So just let your head
Think away the pain
From your cloudy day
Because now you stay in a beautiful place
How could we see clearly if the circumstances we've been born into are not as golden or bright as others? How does someone do so right if only seein' so wrong? How does a community change for the better to change another community? The answer is one word, self. You see you must first change yourself as a person before you can change someone else or correct anyone on their own problems. Only he without sin has the right to judge someone with sins in their wrong heart. Some people are good hearted, some people are bad hearted. Good and bad people both have their differences but one thing they have in common is sleep. You see no matter how long you stay awake, you will always need to sleep. And in that sleep, you exist in another world, another realm. You will wake up in the morning only to have to go to sleep that same night. And then you exist again in the dream world. Keep the dream alive. Mr. PetersonStrugglin', lil niggas is hustlin'
Cops with the K-9 dogs they never muzzlin'
Buttons on apartment floors that we be buzzin' in
Theres something real, someone in trouble and all the youngin' em
I'd kill for my youning' em, feel for the youngin' em
Tryin' to make a mill, to make a meal for my youngin' em
Something I'm discoverin', when we start to love again
That'll be the day we get some peace
But other than that there'll be niggas in the streets
Mad when it's the winter and niggas can't afford heat
When the baby want jordan's but daddy can't afford sneaks
Like whats more important, a pair of J's or the feast
He look at his girl, he gotta provide
It's cold in the house, it's hot outside
And I don't mean that in a weather sense
There's stupid niggas on the premises
Brothers tryin' to be hard headed and so they hella dense
4 year murder still nobody found no evidence
Gotta live your life cause all that other shit irrelevant
Caught up in the light will take your breath up out your ???????
I read about this way back, back in genesis
This is for the mothers holding baby's in they stomachs
Going crazy cause their lover is never there, and rubbers were never there
When lusting you never cared, you frontin'
You just cared about a nut or something
Well something up in your mind was tellin' you don't do it, its too soon
Now you got a little daughter she'll be 2 soon
Plus a son up in your stomach he'll be due in June
And that father try to visit in a blue moon
Its safety still, life ain't a game its real
From the finch to the jane get filled
To the park and the scarbs all the way through steels
Lifes hard, sometimes the cut it might scar
If you live past 18 years your lifes long
Thank god for livin', them bad times we livin' em'
Prayin' that the youth gets baptised I'm serious
Niggas stop selling them cap size, get serious
Need to stop tryna be that guy cause really it
Really ain't worth your soul, ain't worth parole or probation
Life gets more crazy, gotta keep fighting guarantee your gon' make it
Times it will get so deep you can't take it
God gotta be the only one you leave your faith with
Safe it, sacred, place in the safe or the basement
If something worth chasing then chase it
This a serious thing, nothing to play games with
Can't trust friends, some friends will bring hatred
Its safe to say it nigga, its so blatant but God gotta be the only one to leave your faith withWarner Brother
All directions now pointed to haters
That's why these haters so directed at us
Canada
As the lies fall, Canada
Canada
Sincerely Tory, March 26
Shorty residential, I can be your sponsor
I don't want your love baby, just give me them tonsils
Honey know I'm fly like a fuckin' air marshall
Dot niggas ball, it don't matter what it cost you
My niggas on they chains like a motherfuckin' fence
Someone tell them lames hit the motherfuckin' bench
80 for the frames on the eyes of a king
Eyes out for the shirt, iPod for the ring, that's the iPhone
Bad bitches wanna bite me like a python
I'm in your skin like hair with the lice on
It like shit, you can get your face split
Like a zit that you pop when you think it's hot shit
I don't know how I did it, I don't know how I did it
I get so much pussy man, that I don't know how I get it
I be on that I hit it, you be on that I get it
You be on that grown shit, I be on that I live it
Ridin', I'm dippin' dirty, them bitches, they gettin' flirty
I'm high and I'm sippin' purple, I lie no, I'm in the dirty
Them bitches they wanna fuck, I pass to my nigga Kirky
We fuck then we get up early, you want it then get it early
The haters they black ball, paper the back ball
I hit em in the front and leave they brain in the back yard
It's paper to stack dawg, so why you niggas stallin'?
If you ain't stackin;, don't be actin like you ballin'
Actin like Spalding, all up on the court side
Ridin' for the north side, nigga come through
I'm lookin' smoother than a door slide
Move a couple units in, we can get the Porsche ride, livin' by the shore side
When I was just a youngin', imagine little 5-10
Nigga with a onion with some wishes for the bunion
Money ain't a power, ain't a fuckin' nigga stuntin'
I keep it too real that's why these fuckin' niggas frontin'
I put it on his head and let another nigga done him
Never touch the work, I let another nigga run 'em
Pack the Louis luggage, got the one way out to London
We just passed through customs, me and Jae be out the country
And I'm somethin' like a teepee, niggas can't see me
If you pullin' hoes, you gotta rope one for Stevie
Bitches couldn't play me if they burnt me on a CD
Model after model, shit is lookin' like a repeat
I fuck a bitch and pull the swave out of her
Shout my nigga Honey, it's gon' be a loud summer
That's my little sister and I'm very proud of her
Now back to the business, 'bout to blow this cloud bubble
And I, I do this shit, I'm too legit
Refuse your bitch, like a Skype call
I'm killin' germ ass niggas like some lysol
I'm eatin' through the game, it's like a rice wall
But yeah, can I say it any clearer?
That a nigga got your boo but ain't tryna get your scare, get it?
I slide through a chick like debit
Then she eat the dick like credit
Got a new trend and I just might set it
Should of let your mom know, I can get your mind blown
I can kill that bird on your shirt, you can die slow
This that SLS now get the fuck up outta my throne, motherfucker, oh yeahTake my love aside
Talking of my appreciation, babe
Touch me, feel me on you
Half of me, know we can't play no games
Love in the bedroom
Feeling I'm addicted to it
Knocking the headboard
Baby, I'm addicted to it
I wanna make love to you daily
We can do our thing 'til the sun comes up
Baby, if this love was a symphony
If love was a symphony
Then we'd be the high notes
Yeah, raising the high notes
Raising the high notes
Take my confidence in
Make it bigger 'cause girl, I need you
Give me necessary
All the things to, all this love, baby
Love in the bedroom
Feeling I'm addicted to it
Knocking the headboard
Your my gun and I'ma pull the trigger just to show it
I wanna make love to you daily
We can do our thing 'til the sun comes up
Baby, if this love was a symphony
If love was a symphony
Then we'd be the high notes
Yeah, raising the high notes
Raising the high notes
Take me away from it
Pretty little symphony
Pretty little symphonyYou used to be mine
You used to be mine
Sendin' this one now to a lil lady out there. I used to see her, I mean, she used to be mine, right
Look, reminiscin' on the times we had
Made things fine when the times was bad
I couldn't write a rhyme to define your class
Even though I spent time 'til the timin' passed
You used to rock two shoes, miss beautiful
Jimmy Choo shoes and the kiss you would do
From my heart, girl, you had me from the start
There was somethin' 'bout her, I couldn't live without her
The good love with somethin', you couldn't get me outta
I can't lie, I had my first doubts
I thought that you was too pretty for this to work out
I was surprised how this situation turned out
I guess things ain't the way the seem for what it means
Even though we was only younger teens
You always seemed to keep a certain love for me
That's why I'll never know why you set my lovin' free
Tell me if I'm wastin' time
Or does what I'm sayin' register in your mind?
Rememberin' things we used to do
And they keep bringin' me back to you
She used to be my girl
She used to be mine oh mine
I said that you were my girl
Before you met that other guy
She used to be my girl
She used to be mine
She used to be mine oh mine
I said that you were my girl
Oh I, oh I, I wish you were here right now, girl
Oh I, oh I, I wish you were here right now, girl
Oh I, oh I, I wish you were here right now, girl
Oh I, oh I, I wish you were here right now, girl
I know that this might take some time
But at least tell me what's on your mind
So many heartaches that keep happenin' and you know it
And girl, I hate this feelin' but I can't control it
Shawty, girl, I'm down because you ain't around
Oh well, gone for now, hope you hear this now
She used to be my girl
She used to be mine oh mine
I said that you were my girl
Before you met that other guy
She used to be my girl, my girl, my girl, my girl
Reminiscin' on them times, babe. Real hip hop, baby. I say all them times thinkin' 'bout it, got me here reminiscin', yeahYou see the swave is an undeniable force
You see I wanna talk swave but don't know swave talkin'
Now I go by the name of Slim Juice
Keepin' it pimp proof through the tape proof
And I don't know if y'all have enough vernacular in your system for this swavey
Now when you swavey, you ain't no lame man 'cause you out here makin' history
Now I'ma let my brother come up here to the mic
And give y'all a lesson on here this swave play, thank you  brother
Bitches on my uh 'cause I'm swavey
Niggas talkin' slick 'cause I'm swavey
Lame suckers, they know for gang G
Big old rock chain, it's lookin' like the 80's
We don't talk, we make statements
Oh yeah bruh, I mean let me take a second
This is that grade A swave play
Hand me my tail comb, baby
It's the force speakin'
So call up all of your coaches and tell them all of they ballers takin' the off season
I see your flaws like I'm palm readin'
And it's the don 1 speakin', it's the under palm treein'
Cloud speakin', palm peakin', on my own readin'
The time for me to see it, the times I'm keepin'
So they sent that palyer, you ain't even follow that rhyme
I'm not on your time, to catch me, roughers gotta rewind
I mean, I thought that you congratulate me
Turn around and fabricate me
The game changin', look how that fame changed 'em
It's what they say behind the line and now they friends hatin'
Wow, it's friggin' amazin'
It's crazy how I came from a young nigga
Into my country's number 1 nigga
Wow, palms thicker
I just figured fun;s thicker
This the don't you put me in the midst of mixup
I need loyalty
Now the fiends need a fix up
This is exactly what you paid for
They make time and make way for us
Tory Lanez orb, Mr. Paid For
You sure? Yeah, I'm safe sure
Haters hatin' more
There's more money than in the safe drawer
Need I say more? I brought my nigga with me. I mean when life gives me 100 reasons to cry, I show life I got a million reasons to smile. I mean 'cause in the end, it's not gon' matter how many raps I took or how many moments I took breath away. Swavey, I mean you gotta be yourself man. I mean 'cause the ones that mind don't matter, the ones that matter don't mind. Oh yeah, I don't do hip-hop music, or R&B. I do swavey, so that is the genreIf you could put your eyesight through my eye view
Swear you'd see it shorter than a shorty who's 5"2'
High cool palms through this paper I write through
Bout that "Real Love" that a Mary J. Blige do
I do things for shorties who's eyes blue
But her light skin red like Piru
And damn, I'm feeling like a plane
I'm just looking for a air-head shorty to fly through
And I sky through whips like a crash dummy
You cats funny, this rapping is my dad sonny
Lost the mother years back, don't ask money
Niggas who got religious will still blast for me
I'm back like fiends for the drug money
You dumb funny fuckers fronting like thugs buddy
Anyone with a flag can be a blood, but he won't be a blood when it comes to the sun dummy
Asking women, "Why your man counting ones honey?"
Without Wayne, he's still dealing with young money
And I been looking for a girl, so you can take three and lose two and still wouldn't be the one for me
I never wished for niggas to get it intertwined
The money 360°, even sitting in a line
I realize none of these niggas is friends of mine
Mel Gibson ain't the only nigga catching signs
You gotta understand I'm in a different mind
I'm Vince Carter x2, I'm in a different prime
I got my fork and my knife like it's dinner time
Taking niggas greens like trees in the winter time
I feel lost with this pen of mine
I'm just talking, I ain't even begin to rhyme
I'm burning up rappers like 
Like a pimp at a strip club, you can get behind
Feel your mind change, in this diaphram
It's all mind games, It's part of the diagram
And I sit back and watch time change
My frame cool in a room full of five lames
Mr. Nine chain wearing round my neck piece
SB fans in the winter with the fresh fleece
I'm X streets,  best be
In and out the slot like a USB
Crew freshly dressed 
Watch your M-A-N-V-M-E
But I can bring that fly shit right back
Make a broad say I'm bad like Mike Jack
Type of rappers wanna lie while I write facts
Sleeping on niggas, PJs and a night cap
You see, I'm cold as an ice rack
But I'm fresh out the mouth like a nice jab
I heard your pipe rap, Family Guy
I ain't sharp, one shot your brain marrow fly
But I can burn you mans alive
You faker than a human disguise
Just take it how two mans collide
I shine, I can take the sun from the South and leave Houston deprived
But, Houston, we got a P-R-oblem
Whether you are Batman or Robin
 in a room, a bafoon or a goon or a goblin
You are nothing but a joker in the city of Gotham
I feel I was tossed in this mix off
Shit got me puzzled like a jigsaw, shit, boy
We living it all like it's pish posh
But I'm feeling like a block, like Chris Bosh
To see succession or beat depression and leave recession
I got devilish style, I need to see the Reverend
I need a blessing to leave a lesson, to key in testing
'Cause I'm professional, born in a seminal
If I'm the envelope, you niggas the centerfold
I'm in heaven still tryna dodge the men below
I'm telling every girl that we can't elope
States boy getting peeled like antelope
And we ain't on the same level, the same stage
Still Fly like Drake, but we ain't on the same page
As far as the future sees
Welcome to the future, T.O
Welcome to the mixtapeHa ha, Yessir
You know this one's going out to all my T Dot Girls, baby
Ha, what they look like rounds, ha ha
Yea, you know how we do it for the shorties reppin' out the T.O. right

Fightin' niggas older than me
My older brother said he won't defend me
I'm like, "Fuck it, nigga, don't defend me"
I know the Lord sent me
I sense Jehovah in me every time my soul is empty
I know the devil on my shoulder heavy
But the Lord'll always have some soldiers ready
I've exposed how deadly this war can get already
Mind, body, flesh, and my flesh
I know the heavens and the hells
Is both fightin' for my soul when I rest
I got these tightened up holes in my chest
They feel cold in my vest
And still, I pray my son'll grow in my steps
So he can get that same feelin' at night
And know his life got a purpose
And he ain't gotta pop a pill in his life
Ain't gotta hit them corners, chillin' wit' them killers at night
Like I did, and make mistakes that I did, tryna provide for my kid
I can't let him just rumble through all of the fumble that I did
'Cause I slid, so many times on all of these niggas I just can't 
Let his life fall into shambles, know this, life is all a gamble
But we bettin' from this angle, nigga
I'm tryna teach my brothers 'bout the dangers, nigga
Cold world, I'm tryna make some fuckin' changes, nigga
Give us somethin' that's gon' change us, nigga
Positive conversations when niggas angry, nigga
Instead of throwin' us in cages, nigga
Section 8, they got us livin' by these wages, nigga
Stop treatin' us like we dangerous, nigga
And maybe we'll stop bein' so dangerous, nigga
A lot of niggas out here stainin' niggas
If he your color, he your brother, you can't hate this nigga
Self-hatred what they taught us 
And look at all the shit it brought us
Mothers, daughters, sons, and sisters all in coffins
And what we got to show? Somebody that's recordin', nigga
Mental illness at an all-time high
We so caught up in the 'Gram, tryna be all-time fly
So much, you can't even show up in the same clothes
Somebody always lurkin', they clockin' your same pose
Callin' all women hoes, you know how the sayin' goes
Everywhere I go, I see the same hoes
But that's the same shit I'm sayin' don't save souls
Am I a hypocrite for sayin' them same roles?
I'm tryna change life, change mines, and change yours
But bitch, I'm only human, I fall in the same toes sometimesJust lemme breathe
I feel like I'm goin' crazy, love me or hate me
Who's gonna save me from myself?
When I feel like there's no one else
When it feels like there's no one left
To keep my feet on the ground
'Cause I'm happy now but I'm crashin' down
Who's gon' save me from myself?
To keep my feet on the ground
I feel everybody needs somethin' from me
Me, I just feel like I need me some money
Or somethin' real soon, I need a deal soon
The only paper comin' are these fuckin' bills due
But wintertime comin', I ain't fuckin' chill proof
Mind tellin' me, "Chill, money's comin' real soon"
Still I feel I'm under like I'm stuck in milldew
Surrounded by fake people who don't speak the real truth
My girl hate me, think I'm creepin' with the duck
Or think I'm sleepin' with another but she don't even trust 'em
She wanna leave 'em, she don't love 'em
I understand, I just wanna let you know I wasn't, but fuck it then
Just know it's huggin' when it's huggin'
You always know it's real when it's comin' from the stomach
See this is how I feel, these the problems I'm confrontin'
I wish that I could clutch 'em and crush 'em, but fuck it
I feel like I'm goin' crazy, love me or hate me
Who's gonna save me from myself?
When I feel like there's no one else
When it feels like there's no one left
To keep my feet on the ground
'Cause I'm happy now but I'm crashin' down
Who's gon' save me from myself?
To keep my feet on the ground
I wake up every day up on the floor
Waitin' for the day I'm on my tour
Prayin' for today to be the score, maybe not, maybe sure
I wanna better myself, I wanna make me more
I wanna live good, I want the lake and shore
I want the sold out shows with a great applause
I wanna be the star player in the game of cards
But when I take the score, it's like they hate me more
And child openings ain't openin'
So he prays to God hopin' that'll help but some hope in him
Now he's feelin' low again, exploadin' and openin' on folks of him
All he wants to do is get his vocals spin
They don't even see him like it's invisible clothes he's in
They must love to tease and that's the reason they provokin' him
Cheesin' with the coldest grin, he don't like to show it so he holds it in
Just know that I know it, man, yeah
I feel like I'm goin' crazy, love me or hate me
Who's gonna save me from myself?
When I feel like there's no one else
When it feels like there's no one left
To keep my feet on the ground
'Cause I'm happy now but I'm crashin' down
Who's gon' save me from myself?
To keep my feet on the ground
Look at me, I'm just like you
Got my own list of problems
Yeah, who gon' save me from myself?
Crashin' down, but I'm happy now, but it's
I feel like I'm goin' crazy, love me or hate me
Who's gonna save me from myself?
When I feel like there's no one else
When it feels like there's no one left
To keep my feet on the ground
'Cause I'm happy now but I'm crashin' down
Who's gon' save me from myself?
To keep my feet on the groundStupid ass lil bitch

Feel me drugs to try and fight
All my memories of the night and day
I often ask myself to run away
I'm still ashamed that I ain't done it yet

Good livin' in the summer day
'Cause I'm a war child, yeah
There ain't no love for no war child, yeah
Watch your back, lay 'em down
Pull the trigger, bang
Pull me on the floor, bang me on the kitchen sink
Why you can't fight? Tell me why they have to go
Take me to your village and prepare me for the war
Livin' sin, livin' walls
This is my fear now
Mama dead, father cried
Try to find a way to people that like me inside
This the war, ain't no stoppin' now
Bodies on the floor, children on them bodies
When you hear the roar, who is causin' that?
Oh that just be me you must of got me in the eye

'Cause I'm hungry, I'm to the point that my ribs ache
I just wanna see your hips shake
My Latin shawty call me papi while she fix me up a big steak
See I'm hungry for a big plate 
And I'm never full even though I just ate
Call me the foreign model fucker, get they twist on like a soda bottle cover
Tired of breaking it to niggas that I got they lover, hold her and I fold her like some sort of origami sculpture
Read between the lines, see between her eyes
Killing that pussy R.I.P. between yo thighs

Fake niggas do fake shit so don't believe the liesKnow you messin' with a winner, baby
I mean we only with the best though
You know I never fail, right?
I mean but it's not about me
'Cause we can leave the season in a bliss
Say the best silence is me with a kiss
Well, I guess I got a meetin' with your lips
In case with your face and agree with your hips
They say love's just agreement with a twist
Me, I see love is the reason we exist
And baby, you the sweetest, see you click
And I would hate to see you leave for someone else who ain't this

And I ain't gotta even know her name yet
I hit the spots that your ex can't get
Even though X marks it, I'll be in the star ship
Bringin' you the stars 'til you star sick

I'll be in there, seats on recline, bad bitch in the passenger
Spliff burning with Matesa on, you feel me?
Lay back, just cruise
Riding to the music, this is how we do it , all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all 
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go 
Whether that's right I will never know
But here goes nothing
Uh, everybody saying remember me
But where the hell is y'all memories?
I'm searching through walls of my membrane
It's insane, I'm entertainin' the big names
Through diamond, silver lining on my big frames
Niggas stressin' all I'm seeing through the Oakleys
Shit depressin', so we investing to blow trees
Had a dream I was chillin' in the OC
Then I landed out in Cali where they woke me
Discrete mumbles, from summer to street jungle
Voice from my uncle he tell me to keep humble
But at times I slip into deep wonder
Would they show they support in the event that my feet stumble?
See, when you already on, it's harder to say shit
Like the feelin' when you dazed and caught in amazement
Girls gotta stay separate from all of your statements
'Cause for the most part, hoes want a part of the payment
I'm relaxing in the Rolls Royce
Getting money 'cause I give these hoes no choice
I'm all alone in my box, blunt burnin' in the zone with my thots, wait
Sometimes a nigga change for the money
Ladies that love me and all of these whips I roll
But buying all the dollars, so why would I holla?
Tryna put my pockets on swole
And I ain't got no time, no-no time 
I just got memories, oh no-no, yeah
Riding to the music, this is how we do it , all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

Thank you, baby. You're a doll
Hey Mr. Lanez
Yessir
Go get 'em
Uh, la-la-la-landin' out a rocket ship
Pick my head from out the glass, breathin' check for oxygen
I don't know where I'm at, compass check, where's the map?
Fuck the world and if you don't love a nigga, wear a hat
Landed on this atmosphere, all I hear is snare and clap
Took everythin' that I feared, rerecord, hear it back
Told me that my mother died, me, I wasn't clear to that
I look in the mirror, my reflection doesn't mirror back
Grandma say I'm hella dense, father say intelligent
Aunt Suzanne let me be free, been my nigga ever since
Brock always supported me, Moses thought me morals he
Showed me what to do, now I make music, so accordingly
Yeah, I swear everything happens for a reason
Day to day begins and every day creates a season
I take off my space gear, pull myself from placement
Open up the slidin' doors and hop up out the spaceship
When the lights are blinding
And everything that surrounds your being
And tonight's your landing
In the new world, and planned this
And you're just landing
You're landing, you're landing, you're landing
You're landing, you're landing, you're landing
And you're landing, you're landing, and you're landing, you're landing, and you're landing, you're landing
And you're landing, you're landing, and you're landing, you're landing, and you're landing, you're landing 
When the lights are blinding
And everything that surrounds your being
And tonight's your landing
In the new world, and planned this
And you're just landing
You're landing, you're landing, you're landing
You're landing, you're landing, you're landing Um, what up? It's your boy, it's your bad ol' Tory Lanez, man. And um, I figured a tape wouldn't be right without one of these so. You know how we gon' do it. Sunny on the boys, me on the beat. You know I'ma create some crazy shit like them doowop boys and corner boys back in the day. Let's go
This a story 'bout this girl, her name is Lori
And she livin' right down the street
Ooh baby, with the high school range
Walkin' down 7th street
And you know what they say
'Bout a girl in here is perfect for me
But I'm young and I got high school dreams
Of bein' your dancin' king
Now this story just a little bit different
'Cause Lori 'bout 23
And it's sad that I wanna get a little hot
'Cause I'm only like 17
Girl, I don't wanna wait
Forever for your love
Not another day
So tell me, are you down?
Are you down?
So baby, are you down?
So tell me, are you down?
So you know, I walked into her now. That's pretty much what I told her. She just busted out and just said, "And you know and you know and you know." I'm not, nah she good. Alright, that's that um. She did them ones or twos, man on the microphone on and um, I'm outta here and you know like. You know you
Don't speak it, you don't speak what you don't know. Shoutout all my SLS niggas, we outta here. All my corner boys comin' with me, we outta here. Move back off your shit, my niggaYeah, Carolina High, shit blows
Carolina High, shit blows
Somebody told me the women I used to fuck with tried they luck with all my past niggas
I figured they no Cinderellas with no glass slippers
They only fall for big money ballers and cash getters
Just like the women I used to love in my past letters
We claimin' fuck 'em but them niggas love 'em
That's why when winter come around, you find them niggas cuffin'
That's why when women come around, you find them niggas bluffin'
That fly nigga come around, you find your chick is nothin'
'Cause see, women attracted to them niggas with status
And we niggas attracted to these bitches with ass and tits
Chanel bags with some fashion tips
To keep 'em sexy round they ass and hips
Shit, I heard Aneesa got a baby now
I heard Alisha got a lady now
I heard them streets done got crazy wild
I heard my nigga black car caught a motherfuckin' crack charge
And he in the pen servin' 80 now
Wow, shit got real after high school
Remember Kelly was so friendly back in night school
'Til she moved with this nigga named Ty
Got her high, now that bitch is movin' colder than an ice cube
I know minimum wage will kill ya
And trust me, I ain't got to work minimum wage to fell ya
'Cause when he out the cellar, for wish without he sellin'
Is court cases is spillin', he tryna pay for appealin'
And still, they label him villian and still that cable need electricity
Bills up to the ceilin', he can surely make a deal if fuck
If you don't feel him, I don't know about you
Emergin' all you bad girls, take that whore 'bout ya
They love when niggas low 'cause he ain't thinkin' all about ya
And don't be strippin' 'cause a nigga need some dough up out ya
That shit is crazy and it always made me wonder why
You made 200 dollars, give that man 105
I see your face could see your place, you need to come and find
Baby, you are a human, you ain't no wonder line
And way too smart to be undermined for a fuckin' dime
And for some sense up in your brain, I think it's fuckin' time
See these Carolina blues is what marijuana do
Lot of women gotta lie to niggas that they lyin' to
And because of this, it make it harder to define true
And because of this, it make it harder to define you
And I'm always talkin' 'bout some women that I should have got
And always talkin' 'bout some pussy that I should have popped
And always talkin' 'bout some pussy that I should have shot
And when I see that lil motherfucker, nigga watch
In all reality, I'm probably gon' see him on a day that I don't want it
Fuckin' leave him but really this shit is crazy
And maybe, I might just leak him
But whatever I choose to do and you just better believe him, nigga, Carolina high
If you don't feel me, I don't know
I don't knowI'm leanin'
You don't even know
I'm leanin'
Rollin', zonin'
Tell me you don't mean it
You don't mean it, you don't mean it
Sippin' on somethin' strong
And you don't wanna even know
Sippin' on somethin' strong
When I got nothin' to lean up on
Sippin' on somethin' strong
I'm paint fallin', my place stalln'
They in the whip, they hatin' on me
They say they love me, they snakin' on me
They outside, they waitin' on me
Aw yeah, I'm ready
Smokin' up and I'm steady smokin'
They holdin' down on it, posed to hold me up
Ballin' niggas so heavy
And I'm ridin' clean, hoes outta me
But they tell the truth to them niggas
Fuck y'all, I'm 'bout to fuck y'all
I'm glidin' through with my niggas
I got cash to fuck
With a ass like that, I have to fuck
Oh oh, now let me come down, ooh, I'm dippin'
We takin' shots tonight, Scotty Pippen
It's this bitch, call me Pippen in this bitch, yeah
I'm leanin'
Rollin', zonin'
Tell me you don't mean it
You don't mean it, you don't mean it
Sippin' on somethin' strong
And you don't wanna even know
Sippin' on somethin' strong
When I got nothin' to lean up on
Sippin' on somethin' strongAy girl, I know it's been a long while since we last talked
It's been about a couple years now, we been away too long
I wish that I could pick it up, from where we left off
Now girl, I know it ain't the same now, I heard you got a man
But look at what you look like, girl, you don't understand
If we get caught up in the mood, crack a bottle of the Rosé
Would you wanna be my boo? Would you wanna be my shawty?
What if we go out, do all your favourite things
Everything's alright, tell me do you think this could be
A situation, situation
Uh, seems rain is the weather
Know the situation ain't makin' things better
But nowadays, shawty duckin' under pressure
'Cause it seems conversations full of fuck it and whatevers
Still she love me, it's a blessing
Still she got another lover and she love when they together
But fuck it, it's whatever
'Cause we ought to get to touchin', you don't know what do next
A situation come usually
But she ain't love the man her man used to be
I just wanna see it truthfully
I just wanna see it truthfully
I just wanna see it truthfully
I just wanna see it truthfully
The situation is serious, had to break it down
Let's lay under the summer, lemme break you down
Muai tai dinners, you penners with cubes in 'em
Religion True denims that match mine, you damn fly
Look you better than Miss Curly Sue
I would cop you the ring, rocky pearly blue
Baby, we can be a match, that'll surely do
With my fly stacks and curvey you
Just hit me in the early now
If we get caught up in the mood, crack a bottle of the Rosé
Would you wanna be my boo? Would you wanna be my shawty?
What if we go out, do all your favourite things
Everything's alright, tell me do you think this could be
A situation, situation
Now baby, what if we go out
What if we do your things
Like everything's alright
Tell baby, do you think
Now baby, what if we go out
What if we do your things
Like everything's alright
Tell baby, do you think
What if we go out, do all your favourite things
Everything's alright, tell me do you think this could be
A situation, situation

Gold grill, give a lil bitch cold chills
I don't really give a shit about a hoe still
But I will let her ride like a four wheel

Turn up the speakers pimp and you know it penetrate
I came to the club, I sat that bitch on 28s
I ain't on a budget, you know I'm spendin' money great
But I still go to dinner and I make 100k
Shinin' on my schedule, I spend 90 on my bezzle
And I'm lookin' hotter than an iron on a kettle

You know swavey, that's the model, so we only backin' models, Swavey
I woke up, I'm still cute
That's your new girl? She'll do
Old money, mills do
New shoes on the coupe, where the roof?
I think that it's time we put you niggas in the lay off
Know that I'm ballin' and put a nigga in the Playoffs
Canada bull ridin', Pirellis in the coupe
Don't gotta be watchin' them jack boys on the stoop
It's money we makin', you know a nigga really get it
And we gon' ball because we stackin' 'til we tippin'
I'm blowin' the money on me, you know I'm gettin' paper
And if you trip, trippin' then I gotta see you later
All the women buggin', she just chucked it for a bill
Baby by the field like we duffin' off a pill
And I'm wearin' Js, 150 for my sneakers
I'm tryna grow my hair, women say they love my features, Swavey
I woke up, I'm still cute
That's your new girl? She'll do
Old money, mills do
New shoes on the coupe, where the roof?

Yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
I can't believe it I did it all to get it and livin' and riskin' it all to live it all
For suckers that shitted on me and bitches that didn't call
And niggas that doubted, hated, plotted my town fall but never got it
I made it, I'm watchin' they frown fall
Ain't no better feelin', nigga, sayin' you better kill it
The last nigga that got it done did it big
And you could potentially do it bigger
Eventually to the figures that move you in the position here enemies shoot to kill you
I am livin' fast and I have notice time is an essence
And I'm thankin' God in a clock, I noticed time is a blessin'
And bitches just like the feds, cuffin', try and arrest them
My luck was on this dummy while on this ride to progression
I'm barely focused on jewelry, fuck it diamonds' a stresser
I want you to love me for me and I was shinin' on my chest
So I do livin' while enjoyin' the finer things
I owe the shit outta y'all for givin' me fucking wings, thank you
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
And I owe this shit all to Shawn for showin' me all the wrongs
He told me I have a chance, I told him, "It's fuckin' on"
He knew my verses was wild, he sat and nurtured my style
He always would have these discussions, I sat and I heard him mad
He said, "Don't get caught up with women, don't be concerned with a child
They vividly ain't the catcher, this industry it ain't with you
The niggas you callin' friends is the niggas that play to get you
And always stay on your grind if it's dollar signs that you picture and shit
Remember your sound and remember who found you
And when you blow, just remember who was never around you
All them niggas that clowned you and the bitches that downed you
When you doin' something they go and go and look at you or somethin'
But all they do is frontin', so fuck them, to you, they nothin'
See that you knew they stuntin', they act like you new or somethin'"
So livin' good and enjoyin' the flyer things
I owe this shit all to Shawn for giving me fuckin' wings, my nigga
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
I be like hell, ain't no way is not over
My memory takin' me back to that day in October
Me and my brother Jay was sittin' right there on that corner
Our faces was full of tears, just waitin' to blow up
All our niggas was job stuntin', we shoulda been job huntin'
But fuck it we was some drop outs, ready to rob somethin'
And I'm livin' in sin, I'm a shawty nigga
Jay helped me settle down, always got me, my nigga
Was live in broken homes, took me from open homes
His mother let me live inside her house with open arms
Cold as December night, shit, you remember right?
We stayed up late, just fantasizin' 'bout that lemon life
Now that I got it, you need it, I'm fuckin' 'bout it
I see it and everywhere we gon' be there nigga, I'm promisin'
Livin' good, enjoyin' the finer things
I owe this shit all to you for givin me fuckin' wings, my nigga
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the rowLoving you right, loving you right, loving you 
Loving you right, loving you right, loving you 
Touching you right, touching you right, touching you
Feels for the night, dancing in the midnight
Oh, I just wanna be loving you right, loving you right
Give any rubbersNow, Mr. Peterson, this is no ordinary classroom we're talkin' about You see, this is classroom 105
Now I'm warnin' you, some of these students are not right in their minds
You see, these were the kids who couldn't pay attention in class because they were too busy drawin' or writin' lyrics in their song books
With you bein' the substitute teacher, Mr. Peterson, I can't lie to you, these kids are lookin' for a show
Soon as my sneakers hit the tile of the classroom
I am your latest teacher, this is past due
Mr. Class Clown, boy, sit your ass down
I am not issuin' hall passes for the bathroom
Mr. Peterson is teachin' this
So much soul brother, I'm preachin' it, leadin' it
Students like, "Oh, oh, he's so secretive"
Even secretaries couldn't tell me what my secret is
My first lesson is maneuver shit
I'm so fly, I need a stewardess for jewels to fit
So if you got the new, I know I got the newer-ish
And I don't even shit on them, it's manure, bitch
My flockin' brains on planet Mars
I ride the beat like wheels with some handle bars
My flow iller than a man with a can of sauce
It's Mr. Peterson, baby, I am in charge
Juicin' this music, am I confusin' your students?
'Cause I don't want to, I just want you to get through when you do it
Movin' through, doin' your schoolin', coolin' with friends that you cool with
You sure would love with this music, it's like aruga from Cupid
They screamin' man on fire, red so hot that
The children wanna die that my hands on fire
This the best of me and I can't call Maya
12 for the rims, suckers can't ball higher
I'm goin' too hard
I swear my students say recordin' is my job, they mock me foolish lately
Call me a slob, that's what they used to say
But now you ain't even got a choice, gotta get used to me
It's Mr. Peterson, I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone
I'm outta here
Lately, I been tired of loving
So cold, so cold, so cold
Lately, I been tired of loving
So cold, so cold, so cold
Said it's the Mr. Peterson
It's the Mr. Peterson
I'm so motherflockin' go
We outta here, baby
We outta here, baby, woah
We outta here, baby
We outta here, baby
We outta here, baby
We outta here, babyI mean I figured, I figured I'd give you the real me
So you could feel me, yeah
This is what I call the makin' of the motherlovin' greatest
Amazin' how I made it through the gutter to your playlist
Some still wondered, I tunnel through all the hatin'
And I made it to the top, y'all can stop your debatin'
I lay face with my face to the pavement
Days when I slept on the floor, my aunt's basement
Ain't lookin' for remorse, I just showin' you the basics
Course I was forced to make it or be the wasted
Niggas could've loved, instead they engraved hatred in they hearts for me
Please God, turn the cards for me
I'm on top of the world with no apostrophe
I know my mother's up there with you
I know she lookin' down at me through a clear picture
Bear with me, let me share with you
'Cause in my lifetime, I jot it down when I write rhymes
See I was left lane cruisin', I wasn't in my right mind
How could y'all judge me?
If y'all don't love me, just say you don't love me
Fuck it, I ain't lookin' for your love nor judgement
Long as this money more comin'
Niggas I don't love nor trust them
The grind got me addicted to cash flow
Room spinnin', feel I'm sippin' in a fast forward motion
Tell the waiter pass more portion
Gotta thank God for my mom, she could have had an abortion
I'm true meanin' that dreams can come true
If somethin' that's a lie can never become true
So if you got a dream, believe and just you
'Cause when everybody gone, who left? Just you
We can master crash up bein' active
We are more than people, we are the masters
If I wasn't here, I prolly be in the casket
Gotta get money, nigga, fuck livin' average
Come on niggas, you gotta think smarter
When you ain't got much, you gotta think Sparta
Life swing at you, you gotta swing harder
Think before I shoot, it's more Vince Carter
Uh, I been alone since 14
Was forced to be the man on my own since 14
Stand for more things but plans for more dreams
They put me in positions to sit inside the land of no dreams
How could you blame me? This is my life, nigga
This no entertainment and nigga, this is real
If it's fakin', I never claim it
My life written in stone, this shit is ancient
This is ancient like a slave ship
Niggas pussy 'cause I take trips all around down
Now I'm on my grizzly jams, to the damn town
Know I'm on curve busy like a pretty, brown round nickel
I can't let the time just pass me
So don't worry 'bout me
Baby I'm outchea
Dreams that I'm chasin', I can't forsake them
But I'm gon' chase my dreams until I die
So don't worry 'bout me
Baby I'm outchea
Dreams that I'm chasin', I can't forsake them
Yeah, constant repetition
It's passive aggression
I mean I been doin' this so long
It's like I feel like
I could go twice what I already did
Feel meBreakfast N Vegas

Como no sabía que cartera comprarte, te las compré to'as
Baby, tú sabes que por ti me voy a to'a
Por ti le picheo a to'as
Me ves llegar de Versace y te mojas to'a, yeh
Dime como corre la BM en la carretera
Chequea si la corta cabe en tu Carolina Herrera
Si quieres en tu closet monto una boutique de zapato y cartera
Y chingando, bebé, hago to'o lo que tú quieras
Tú eres exclusiva, como ella ya no vienen
Las otras no suenan igual cuando se vienen
Con tu totito me comprometí
La llevé pa' Francia como se lo prometí
Con vista a la torre Eiffel se lo metí
I give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up for you
Yo tengo el control, bebé
Desnúdate, entrégate
Con un par de gotas de miel, voy a decorar tu piel
Usa Armani y Chanel
Eso pa' ti 
Yo soy tú religión y tú mi monja fiel
Yo voy a darte hasta mojarte
Me vuelvo un demonio y devoro tus partes
Si se  voy a enseñarte
Múltiples orgasmos voy a causarte
Yo sé que el dinero a ti te emociona
Yo soy tu león y tú mi leona
Tu cuerpo desnudo en el Amazonas
 control de tu zona
I give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up for you
All this for you
Todo esto para ti
Pide lo que quieras, baby
Solo tú me pone así
Dale, mami, entonces pide lo que quieras
¿Quieres zapatos o tú quieres una cartera?
En mi lista tú eres la primera
Quieres mi mango, yo te doy la parte entera
Todo lo que tu quieras, tú te lo mereces
Tú eres la mas dura, la que me enloquece
Baby girl, yo soy tu lo loquito
De todito favorito
De tu sexo un adicto
Ma', quiero cuidar tu chamaquito

Hear This Music
Hear This MusicTory: Ay, yo y'all remembered last summer though, cuz
Man I had this bangin' shorty last summer. Fly too and super-duper cute
Friend 1: Yo Lanez man, I told you about that  shit, player
Tory: So what y'all tryna say, y'all don't believe me b? Y'all don't believe me?
Friend 2: Explain yourself
Tory: I'll explain it right now, listen
This is that 90s shit. Yea yea y'all, yea yea y'all
Listen here, it's the freshman o' the year y'all
Like yea yea y'all, yea yea y'all
I got a story to tell, it's right hear y'all
Now when I met this one girl early October 
Late night clubbing where the girlies not sober
All the Autumn leaves were falling, but it barely got colder
A hoodie season beginner wear, seems we lost quota
I  a couple times but my lines crossed over
Told her that I don't drive because I got chauffeured
She took all my rich words and swissed all the mixed slurs
So off a this, I'm thinking yo this is my chick, word
We moved on to dinner dated with the Crouton
To even bigger date, Interstate, with the roof gone
I'm thinkin', yo I really like this girl
 got me tryna wife this girl, now-e-e
And since I'm thinking wedding gowns in the future
F them, ye man, settle down with the cuter, Kama Sutra
Sheets up, umbrella upstairs
She lay me on the sofa and took over from there, yea
Your'e that girl
With the  I've never seen
And I swear that your so fine
You send chills right to my spine
So I hope you commit to being mine
My summer girl, oh yea yea
To share with my whole world 
So my love , you know I need that summer love
That summer love 
That summer love 
You know I need that summer love 
So then I woke up, low cut, fade on my brain
Feel great, engraved her name on my chain
Sweet, One of the same, Her chain, it read 'Lanez'
Had the Cat Woman dance, black braids and red frames
Word is born, listen to the words of this song
Might think a happy ending, well your version is wrong
Yo my love life is close to the dung
I woke up in the morning, couldn't see her like a verse in the song
Shorty was magic
She vanished like a hat in a rabbit
I'm psychiatric, I'm thinking like that chick was attractive
Now I'm looking at the table there
A label there? No it's a letter and it's made to share
I read the letter, it read:
My love, Lanez, had to leave and it's a bummer
But keep me in your dreams, I'mma see ya next summer
For no particular reason, she was leaving for a season
Instead cheefing, I just listened and kept on dreaming, One Love
Your'e that girl
With the  I've never seen
And I swear that your so fine
You send chills right to my spine
So I hope you commit to being mine
My summer girl, oh yea yea
To share with my whole world 
So my love , you know I need that summer love
That summer love
That summer love 
You know I need that summer love 
Yo son, she was driving me wild then. I was like damn
Know what i'm saying, shorty was like the black Marilyn Monroe for real
She was good from the stay, I was right there. You feel me though?
I'mma see you next summer though Kim, fo real
But until then, you know it's summer love, cause she be driving me outa my mind
Hope I see that bitch next summer, ha ha ha ha

But they love you when you broke and you in their position
Just beware when your nigga in love with bigger bossin'
'Cause that same nigga lovin' be that nigga crossin'
Pickin' duckin' the visions of bigger budgets
We ignore haters and all them niggas they fuck with
They the same suckers that run and tell you they love you
As soon as you turn your back, they be tellin' lies to the public
Well uh, tell your lies, tell your lies, tell your lies, nigga
Just makin' sure you don't end up tellin' to my niggas

I can tell my time comin', I can feel it's madness
Know it's comin', know it's comin' like I know these nigga
Knowin' money, blowin' money, I'm so fuckin' careless
Never judge me for the shit that I say on the record

I opened Pandora's box and got Pandora swave
Now every time I dress, a nigga over swavey
Ain't gotta rap, my shows pay
And when I go to dinner, my hoes pay
Got the bow, we look like Ohio
Line me up some women, I make sure they single file
Got these women whinin' like I sprayed them with Biscotto
With your favourite chicken tryna get it like the lotto
Ain't got time for you, it's Swavey, I back the bottom
Got 'em talkin' 'bout that big paper, I'm stackin' bottles
And I'm shinin' like a light saber that's swervin' back
I be ballin' like a white Laker, that's workin' heavy
I got paper like the mayor, I can't do nothin' but swave it out
Girls on my dick 'cause it ain't bigger than my bank account
I mean my dick is big but there's just too much of a bank amount
Bravo switch the beat up, everythin' they think about
Pandora swave, yes I'm in that
Charlie Sheen, trickin' women
Bunch of fly flock of women chillin' with me
Charlie Sheen, trickin' women
Now, we're gonna take a break, have a rest stop. Just havin' some technical difficulties. It's just too much swave happenin'
My girl got shape like a cinderblock
I get more paper than a printer god
I don't buy my clothes, I let my women shop
'Cause they know how I'm s'posed to look when I go out
Heavy shard lazy, like it's four cities with my glasses Varsayse
Oops I mean Versace, Herachi, from 9th street
Women they harass me, they ask me to dine me
I swim, put money on these 8-7's, tell me what you talkin'
Trickin', ballin' like I play for Memphis, mean I'm on my Grizzley
Might as well just call me Michael Pippey
My last broad couldn't hang, I threw her like a frisbee
Word to the swave, I got a chick off that, nigga go on, holla
Put that big bank roll look like oblongata
But this big car note look like long thong thotta
Swave maker original dime thotta, swavey
Pandora swave, yes I'm in that
Charlie Sheen, trickin' women
Bunch of fly flock of women chillin' with me
Charlie Sheen, trickin' women
Don't worry, the swave will only be here foreverKid 1: If I had me a million dollars, I get me a Porsche 959
Kid 2: I get me a sports car like a Jaguar
Kid 3: Damn, I get me a Ferrari Testarossa with V12 engine. Get me a Porsche 930, straight 6 turbo engine. Get me a Vector B12, twin turbo. Go from 0 to 60 in 7.8 seconds. So don't even talk
Kid 4: Yeah but who cares 'cause you ain't never gon' have a million dollars anyway
Kid 3: I will to
Kid 4: Who's trippin' now?
Kid 3: Ain't nobody trippin'. I'm gon' have it. Someday, I'm gon' have it

Rimes what up, you know what I'm sayin'
We don't like 'em, we one night 'em you dig
Uh, uhI gotta get into my, uhh
Story-telling state
It's like
Ayo, what happened last summer
It started with a text message saying
"Hey man, my name is Raven and we exchanged numbers
Sometime last night around the Government club"
Now I'm sittin 'here wondering "what?", cause I don't 'member that
But I sat back and played along with her
I logged on my phone, seen her face on Twitter
The voice in my brain saying "Lanez go on get her"
So I'm thinking with all that switching
Looking at my phone, no call back digits
Matter of fact, the phone call restricted
She won't come straight, so I'm all offended
But I let it down
Cause just cause lil mama call block didn't mean we couldn't mess around
So I kept on texting, but I shouldn't love her
And by now she had me open like a book cover
I mean shorty knew everything about me
She my ray of sunshine when it's cloudy
It's like shorty my 3-1 without 3
And then she questioned like "Do you heave a girlfriend?"
I said "nah, I'm as single as first head"
And even though I know I'm lying my pants off
Shorty too special just to give up the chance dawg
And I never seen Raven in person
But the pictures that she sent me are the whirlwind
And I would change my girlfriend for her sting
So I text her the question "Would you be mine?"
And then I sat back waiting for a reply
And then she text me
See I'm gon' show a lil' something that's gon blow through your sweet mind
She said "Don't get me wrong, cause I ain't player hatin'
But it's your girlfriend nigga, I was playing Raven
The whole time it was me on the phone
Well I know that you ain't faithful, Imma leave you alone
So uhh, to end it off nigga here is my one note
The dream love me and you had is done for
Now this is how I lost a good girl to a dumb phone
You have no messagesYou can catch me in an orange bandanna with a swagger elite
In a normal whip, sittin in the passenger seat
And maybe you can roll with me, cruisin down the whole city
So pretty, just chillin and bumpin old Biggie
With my boy, got his G2, 
Drove around the city's from T.O to Mississiauga
We never look back, we face the road
Just a couple young teens with no place to go
I took the transit but soon I got enough after
I hated paying 3 dollars for a bus transfer
So I would sit up in a whip with my dude
And tell em, when I'm famous, Imma get him a new
Clean whip to cruise the streets, in that, I'd be a live threat
But he'd be up under the wheel, cause I don't drive yet
Talkin bout the future, when I'm blown up and that
So I can go and turn that lil' tiny whip to a Phantom
We just ride, cops see under the dash
Throgh your hand back, I prommised the rest
We just ride, know we do it and run it
Just chill on the road, while music be bumpin
And you can catch me in my Ralph Laurens, so look out for me, spot me by the balcony
Rather be on my different ish, louder than your little sister is
Mister Mister take your little sister from her innocents
Yeah, I swear I'm feelin bigger than ever
Since I've been thinkin propellers
Make a fella fly, like damn, man, I get hella high
I be higher than an addict in the sky
My cool fool's super cool fools shoes on
Blue armored whip crush like croutons
My whole crew arms, I think I might do time
We used to skateboard, and matter a fact, we hated cars
I laugh about it cause I'm older now
And now them windows getting colder and skateboards don't hold you down
Be what I be, I'm layed back gettin them aged racks
I'm famous, Maybacks in my lane, you feel me
Tory!
We just ride, cops see under the dash
Throgh your hand back, I prommised the rest
We just ride, know we do it and run it
Just chill on the road, while music be bumpinLet me take you to a place nice and quiet
There ain't no one there to interrupt, ain't gotta rush
I just wanna take it nice and slow
See, I've been waiting for this for so long

Honeys love me 'cause honey is money affiliated

Bag her like a brick of white, she'll be at the crib tonight

Let me take you to a place nice and quiet

Got your dame on my jock, gave her mouth a rest

Still notorious nigga she call me Morpheus
And we ain't have to grind our choice 'cause they was forcing us
Still the voice of the poorest of all the poorest

And my engine gets so loud a nigga just gotta floor it
I got more than a Ford Explorer to explore it
And I'm out with a Lauren, it's South for Ralph Lauren
And the game nearly died I put mouth to mouth on it
Meet my meat come put your scalp on it

She call my nigga Jay, she love that nigga Rimes
And we just love to see her 'cause we hit it every time
You mad because your baddest chick is probably just a 9

        She said she born up Tiny Island in Tapioca
I heard she got 10 from deported out in Mexico
They tried to send 'em home but she say, "Let me go"
They put the tracker in her purse so they know where she go
I told her run, run, run, run, run
This country no win ting for you, you, you and me
Beautiful refugee
And even when she stayin' with me in the tropical
She always checkin' off her phone and say she got to go
Would love to keep her here forever but I can't
And the harsh reality of what I think
'Cause she's on the run, yeah yeah, she's on the run
She's on the run to America, oh
So tell me why they wan' take from me?
My beautiful refugee
She, she's so sweet
So why they wan' take her from me?
My beautiful refugee
Why they wan' take her from me?
My beautiful refugee
So why they wan' take her from me?
They always seem to know just where she go
Up in the Hamptons, had her dancin', tell her go
She know they follow her everywhere that she go out
Don't need to tell her 'bout the government, she know about
She say, "Why, why them chase me?
I just want to roam free
As a beautiful refugee"
She say she hate it when they catch her on a J
She on a mission, she say she will never fail
She told me every second counts, can't let a day go
She say they wanna deport her back to Tapioca
She's on the run, yeah yeah, she's on the run
She's on the run to America, oh
So tell me why they wan' take from me?
My beautiful refugee
She, she's so sweet
So why they wan' take her from me?
My beautiful refugee
Why they wan' take her from me?

This is where I'm placing your frame in case you was wonderin'
Niggas getting comfortable too comfortable thinking I won't come up on some other shit, nigga you on some other shit
Heavenly grace so I never forsake the covenant
Though I'm hotter than the covers that you covered with
Still the youngest muh'flocka in the building
And if it ain't the flight then it's probably not appealing
My top ceiling got that ceiling to fill in we in the middle with the dealing just grillin'
So talk and to pop pill in your ceiling it's something close like it's really your feeling
What's going on with the game don't nobody keep it real now
Crooked straight playing up on the deal now
Look how niggas done got you in the field now
Now they slaving your ass you gotta kill now
Huh, lucky I got up on some smarter shit
I always kept it 300 on some Sparta shit
I never let a nigga sway me on no offer shit
I'm really coming for the game I want all of it
More money more problems
Boy I'm getting out Gore money Obama
Tour money oh nigga more drama
More records more checks more commas

Type that and give me my night swirl
I called her in the bed like how you finna do that?
You my next diva, breath sweeter than Similac

Hit the scene like we could chill in the three five
If you wanna bring Donna, we'll smoke the marijuana, it's on
Throw some rake up so that grown shit don't

And girl, tell me what's your name, ain't that
Caucasian girls all over me
Came and you changed my world
And you loved someone
That's my caucasian girl
She came and she changed my world
With a love so real
I know I like my all Asians, black chicks and caucasians
And Latinas nothin' less than divine
Butter pecan, Puerto Ricans

Then I beat it out the freezer
I'm fresh, nigga
You feel it in your chest, nigga
Vanilla chicks is the best
Gets my dick in duress
I'm on some fly shit
Drivin' two in a nine whip
If you don't like me, nigga, then hop off of my

Look at the bigger picture, baby, I'll miss ya, it's Lanez, holla
Caucasian girls all over me
Came and you changed my world
And you loved someone
That's my caucasian girl
She came and she changed my world
With a love so real
I'm lookin' for miss Library
You're stirrin' the high berry
And ice and nine cherries
And lightin' the nine scary
I might get high very 'cause really, I'm low do
Hit the photo, baby, just wait 'til that door close
Back in '92 when I was playin' it roughly
The earth's got burst so it's negative puppy, uh
And schoolgirls used to call me ugly
Made it to the big leagues and they all wanna fuck me
Around 1 AM we was at the club
1:15 showed your boy some love
Around 3 AM I took her back to the house
She say she wanna lay down, I threw her ass on the couch
Now it's 4 AM, she was feelin' the kid
Around 4:03 now I'm dickin' her ribs
Around 5 AM, started lippin' her mouth
About 5:09 I was kickin' her out
Yo, big money, sonny thinkin' that shit's funny
I get in your rib, honey, like somethin' you did funny, gotta love me
If you don't then I don't know better
It's awkward like the coat without the rose gold sweater, I'm gone
Caucasian girls all over me
Came and you changed my world
And you loved someone
That's my caucasian girl
She came and she changed my world
With a love so realThere's so many people in this open world
Doing things they don't understand
Just tryna find happiness
And touch the feeling with their hands
See all the kids are stuck on Instagram
And all our soldiers fighting wars for no reason
When you hurt nobody gives a damn
They pull out phones and start recordin' just to post it and delete it, I know, oh-oh
I won't be a hypocrite, I've been in your position and I've had my share of laughs before
But that don't mean that I'm not tryna grow
'Cause I can be a helping hand
If, all that I can give you is a helping hand, yeah, oh-oh
'Cause I can be a helping hand
If, all that I can give you is a helping hand, yeah, oh-oh
What examples are we setting for the kids?
I stopped and gotta ask myself that question
We show 'em things they don't understand
And all the lessons every one forgot to mention
I don't wanna be a hypocrite, I'm not the best of influences either
But me I'm just like you and we're just tryna grow
'Cause  growing, it's everyday people
'Cause I can be a helping hand
If, all that I can give you is a helping hand, yeah, oh-oh
'Cause I can be a helping hand
If, all that I can give you is a helping hand, yeah, oh-oh
Woah, woah, oh
Oh woahBitch

Sometimes I just wanna get away from everything, you know what I mean?
Think I need a vacation or somethin', uh
I wake up in the morning, life has got a nigga stressed out , stressed out
From the living room I hear my father telling, yelling, "Get out of this house" 
He tells me, "Son, you need a J-O-B"
And then I say, "Dad, man, that ain't for me"
And really I know he ain't havin' that
And says you're gonna need money to fill your habitat
Look in his eyes, I see deep stressin'
Plus, my mother died and that's a depression
On top of that, here comes the weed session
So I smoke and get high
And sometimes I wanna getaway, getaway
Sometimes I wanna getaway, getaway
Every day I need a getaway, getaway
And I just gotta get away, get away
My teacher says I'm kicked out
So I ain't doin' shit now
And plus, I just caught a case
Sometimes I feel my future's bein' thrown away
Out the door without a pause
I'm outta options
And watchin' all the kids graduate
While I'm sittin' in class, I'm in a angry state
My state of mind, I'm wastin' time
I feel like I ain't even close like it's a waitin' line
I just wanna skip but people tell me wait in line
So I smoke and get high
And sometimes I wanna getaway, getaway
Sometimes I wanna getaway, getaway
Every day I need a getaway, getaway
My new girl is trippin' out
Because I'm always dippin' out
Callin' my phone like, "You know what this shit's about"
And I say "Easy, that's some shit you could forget about"
But she don't listen, she keep on bitchin'
And I think, think, is it all worth it?
'Cause baby girl know I'ma be a star
So she can't leave me now, she believe that I'm creepin' dog
I try to tell her I ain't doin' that
But she don't listen, she just listen to her stupid friends
And then she goes, I hang up the phone
Can't deal wit' it, she can't
I just smoke and get high
And sometimes I wanna getaway, getaway
Sometimes I wanna getaway, getaway
Every day I need a getaway, getaway
And I just gotta get away, get awayYeah
Uh huh
It's T Lanez
You already know who it is I shouldn't have even said that

Made it squirt but it took time

You don't need no one to get you to college
You don't need no one to get you the books
Sexy as hell, but your professor probably touch it and he give you an A for effort

Let's go
N-Rimes
Ay 
My camp pull the mileage
Your mans astonishin' family
Possibly, sadly walk through the valley of tossin' and that ain't even 
The shadow of death is the path you accept
If you're passin' the threat I act and address your absentness
Steps 
I will enable, first fatal works 'til you base the verse
Make you hate that pain or be breakin' your stable
Face it on earth
Opposin' the hoes or be open and swallow so stay alert 
'Cause I motion to smoke 'em hopin' not to go to Maplehurst
'Cause my eyes on the fetty, I'm grindin' for plenty
You try my, I'm ready, you'll die if you're empty
So why even test me? 
And keep on resentin' the lesson, I'm guessin' you want it 
So speak in my presence, you're gettin' the present I promise 
A snuff to your head and knee to your ribs 
I flee to your crib and told you're momma "Speak to a kid" 
And after that you actin' wack
I pack up late to catch a fade
Slippin', you'll just have turn  pass the maze
Choppin' bodies in garbage
Honest-hearted and all of them
Harvest, carvin', starve hearts and an arm and leg on an offerin'
Show up to your apartment, walk into the hall of it
Dartin' into the offices
Officer, often talkin'
I'm gone inside of the audits 
Flawless, lawless and heartless
Started   with the dissin
Nigga missin' in a mission and hit you quicker than pixels'
Is you, is you, is you rippin'?
I got your bitch and I'm willin' to break her britches
I break my dick in
Strictly kickin' you chickens and bitches
Is wishin' that he'd ever stopped, but he never stops
Hella hot shots to your melon
Watch rocks in the hella hot
What the  is you gonna do?
Comet crew, I'm comin' through
100 dudes like who the  is you?
Come at you, a homi', I break your body in  tombsWe all in Margiela

Yo bullet to the back make a pussy nigga yell
And I had to get this money 'cause I heard it too surreal

We was riding past the block we hit the brakes he had to bail
And I come from the field leave a nigga by the hill
And the trappers that got high we was aiming outer space
Smokin' strain, you insane, I ain't feeling on the girl
If he ever try to share it with a nigga he get killed
I come from the trap house, my druggy named Tom

Hit a nigga broad day he was dead by the dawn
In the night get it early yeah mommy used to worry

My opps they super super shaky need to kill more
These niggas broke up in these streets so than what's the trap for
I was trapping up north
And still trying go north
I knew if niggas want more notes then druggies pay more
And the system tie you up like extension cords
You make his flight board, homicide
Yo bullet to the back make a pussy nigga yell
And I had to get this money 'cause I heard it too surreal
Then at the label all alone trying to orchestrate a deal
We was riding past the block we hit the brakes he had to bail
And I come from the field leave a nigga by the hill
And the trappers that got high we was aiming outer space
Smokin' strain, you insane, I ain't feeling on the girl
If he ever try to share it with a nigga he get killed
I'd keep a deal witcha

        Dawg I used to fuck her on the weekend
And I swear that pussy smell like peaches
Instagram the photo with no filter
Or SnapChat me that pussy with no features
She let me fuck her on the weekday
And told me not to tell nobody
Left the party with her three friends
We smokin' since I hit the lobby
All these bitches want is trues
And some music they can do 'em too
We on this fuckin' tour bus
Made it this far, now what are you gon' do, for me?
What happened to this?
'Cause we got it in
And we get it in on the side of the city
And you gotta feel me
I'm smellin' like hundreds and 20s and 50s
Inside of the buildin'
She got on money, it's time to come get it
Come ask for these digits
All this time that I spent on you
Now you gon' tell me 
All this time that I spent on you
Girl you know you have to give me some
All this money that I spent on you
Just for you to tell me that it's wrong
For all the time that I spent on you
Girl you know I had to write this song
She let me fuck her on the weekend
And told me not to tell nobody
Left the party with her three friends
We smokin' since I hit the lobby
All these bitches want is trues
And some music they can do 'em too
We on this fuckin' tour bus
Made it this far, now what are you gon' do, for me?
