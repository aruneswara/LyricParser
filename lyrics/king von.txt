And I'ma let that MAC fly just like my nigga Durk 
I’ma let this MAC fly with this, hold on
I said I'ma let that⁠—
Alright, come on , alright 
Got a drop on this flexin' nigga, he from Tennessee
I had a thot, she be with the shit, she told me where he be
I said for sure, baby let me know if you wanna eat
She like, "Von, you already know, just put your girl on fleek"
I’m like, "Cool, I can do that, boo, what you want, some shoes?"
"Jimmy Choo? With a handbag, too? Red or baby blue?"
She get to smilin', she ain't used to this 'cause she ain't used to shit
I'm just laughin', coulda been a pimp the way I move my lips
I be speedin', coulda been a driver the way I push the whip
You a ho, coulda been a bitch the way you throw a fit
But fuck that, right back to the script ’cause this a major lick
He got bricks, plus his neck is icy and it match his wrist
Now it’s like six, told her hit his phone, meet her in The Wic
But he ain't go, but he ain’t that slow, say meet 'em at the store
I'm like cool, let 'em front his move, do what he gon’ do
'Cause this the plot, put 'em in the pot, let it cook like stew
I grab my Glock, it been through a lot, but it still shoot like new
We at the top, yeah we lost a lot​, but that just how it go
But check the score, if y'all lose one more, that's 6-24
Let me focus, can't be zoning out, he pullin' up now
He double parked, he ain't getting out, he in that push to start
That new Porsche, it's built like a horse, colors like the fourth
He got a ring, I guess he ain't divorced, wife probably a whore
Now she walk up, she struttin' her stuff, this bitch thick as fuck
Got in the truck, kissed him on his lip, he cuppin' her butt
Now I sneak up, crouching like a tiger, like Snoop off The Wire
Block on fire, so I take precaution, mask on, Michael Myers
I'm on his ass, he finna be mad, he gon' beat her ass
But this what happen, I got to the door, I thought I was cappin'
I was lacking, 'cause there go the opps, yellin' out, "What's crackin'?"
I'm like, "What?" I'm like, "Nigga who?" I was born to shoot
I got aim, I'm like Johnny Dang when it comes​ to chains
So I rise, hit one in his arm, hit one in his thigh, this no lie
Bitch it's do or die, you said you gon' slide
You got some nerve, your shit on the curb, boy we put in work
From 64th, and from 65th, we not from 63rd
Bitch we not from 63rd

This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O
We in the car, she don't live that far, say she left her purse
And I ain't trippin', you know Von a player, we can go there first
I bust a U, pulled up to her spot, she live by the park
It's gettin' dark, my Glock on my lap, I'm just thinkin' smart
So she hop out, she switchin' and shit, this bitch thick as shit
She got two minutes, if she ain't back out, then she gon' need a Lyft
She left her phone, so I picked it up, this ho slow as fuck
Nine missed calls, three of 'em from Mom, the other six say Duck
Now I look up and I see a truck, it's just pullin' up
Someone hopped out, a big goofy nigga, he tryna look tough
I'm like, "What? What he tryna do?" So I clutched my move
But he kept walkin', he don't want no smoke, boy, he not bulletproof
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O

She walk out, she stop in her tracks, she get to steppin' back
Then I hear smack, this big goofy nigga, he pullin' her tracks
I wanna help, but this ain't my ho, you know how it go
Don't got no cape, I still got her phone, she takin' too long
She get loose, she run to my car, so I hit the locks
Tossed her her phone, told shorty I'm gone, bitch, you on your own
But here come goofy, he hollerin' and shit, yellin' 'bout a bitch
Picked up a brick, he merched it on Brick and threw it at my whip
Now I'm like, "Shit," I hopped out so quick, then I raised my blick
And I don't miss, I let off two shots, I hit him in his shit
Now, Von, think quick, what you finna do? 'Cause this gon' make the news
Gotta make your move, told that bitch, "Get in," 'cause she lookin' confused
I broke the rules, 'cause this bitch a witness, plus I just popped dude
But she ain't cryin', plus this ho was smilin' and this bitch looked cute
So we slide out, I'm checkin' my mirrors, made it to the house
Told her hop out, she say that she hungry, I nod back, "No doubt"
"I know you mad 'cause I smoked your man, left him on the curb"
She started laughin', she say, "Fuck that nigga, he from 63rd"
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee

He double parked, he ain't getting out, he in that push to start
That new Porsche, it's built like a horse, colors like the fork
He got a ring, I guess he ain't divorced, wife probably a whore
Now she walk up, she struttin' her stuff, this bitch thick as fuck
Got in the truck, kissed him on his lip, he cuppin' her butt
Now I sneak up, crouching like a tiger, like Snoop off The Wire
The block on fire, so I take precaution, mask on, Michael Myers
I'm on his ass, he finna be mad, he gon' beat her ass
But this what happened:
I got to the door, I thought I was cappin'
I was lackin', 'cause there go the opps, yellin' out "What's crackin?"
I'm like, "What?", I'm like, "Nigga, who?", I was born to shoot

But fuck that, say you smoking who? Quickest way to die
Snatch who chain? Off who neck? Not mine
Ain't no point in trying
They not out, plus the police hot, ain't no point in sliding
They be talking from the internet, they don't be outside
Hit the six, call DaDa out, tell him 'bout a lick
We need tape, we need rope and phones, don't forget the blicks
He like, "Cool, how that nigga look?" I pull up some flicks
He like, "Damn I think I know the nigga" He cool with his bitch
We at V-Live, but we went to Structure, but we played a lot
Got a goofy walking in and out, telling me his car
He in a Cat, bet, I'ma pay you half, just finesse

Boom, boom, boom 
Bitch, we lurking 63rd

She right off the block, her crib be the spot
And we got Glocks
Tucked all in the shit, don't come unless you knock
But this bitch grimy
Told her 'bout this nigga, helped me set him up
And she was with it
She just want some shoes and she ain't give no fucks
So we do that
I was at his neck, creepin' from the back
But saw the opps and had to let em have it
How fucked up is that?
But where that bitch?
She ain't called me yet, we did that at six
And who got hit?
I know someone, check 'cause King Von, he don't miss
Now two weeks pass
I'm back on my grind, I can't waste no time
The opps been quiet
They be whoopin', though, but them niggas not slidin'
And I been high
I can't even lie, that thot been on my mind
Why she ain't called?
I ain't seen her ass, I hope that she aight
Now it's midnight
I'm hittin' some blocks, just me and my Glock
Came to a stop
I'm at a red light, I usually don't stop
My phone keep ringing
Just a ho, of course, this bitch prolly bored
I press ignore
I ain't got no time, a whore gon' be a whore
Now I get that feelin'
Something ain't right, I look to my right
And I'm like, damn

He get to dumpin'
Bullets get to coming, my heart get to thumbin'

My left shoulder hot, blood just get to gushing
I'm like shit, ain't this 'bout a bitch?
And he with that bitch

She got them big lips that's made for sucking dick
Now it makes sense
That ho set me up, that lil' dirty slut
The double cross
Tryna get me caught like I'm Randy Moss
Ah, shit
I just dropped my gun, plus I got one arm
I'm tryna drive
I can't shoot back now, this man on my ass

Pure codeine
I don't feel a thing, my ho say I'm mean
I need a blunt
Stuff that bitch with Runts, boy, I'm on a hunt
And ain't no breakfast
But I'm a box a nigga, like some Cap'n Crunch
I got a tip

There go that Porsche
How crazy is that? Boy, I'm on his ass
The first blast
It shatter his glass, damn, this nigga fast
He hit the gas
I'm still shootin' at him, but I'm too far back
Damn, I'm hyped
Let me tuck this pipe, get up out of sight
'Cause I see lights
And them bitches bright, can't go to jail for life
So I take flight
Made it to the hood, everything went good
Knock on wood
Flame me up a 'Wood, Tooka smellin' good
Looked at my phone
Got a text from Herb, he say, "What's the word?"
I say, shit, I'm just coolin', bitch

You know how I rock, I'm from that block, boy, I keep a Glock
One up top, pass it to my shorty, if the police hot
She a thot, she just suck me up, we up in your car
Crazy Story, that's her favorite song, she sing it bar for bar
Audemar, I ain't got one yet, I'll prolly go tomorrow
I'm a star, that's what mama told me, I was behind bars
When I stole that car, I ain't go that far, just around the block
I picked up Top, we was bad as hell, foenem throwin' rocks
Muwop and Joey, they had on flip-flops
My luck, folks 'nem sellin' P's, they got the block locked
Popped up, unannounced, nigga, I'm gon' pop some
Stop frontin', doin' all that woofin' and ain't gon' drop none
Drop some, everybody holler, "Von, drop somethin"
But I can't, 'cause all the opps dead, it's hard to drop somethin'
Smokin' on this Tooka pack and it's loud as fuck
Foenem caught Tooka ass gettin' off the bus
I know Tooka mad as hell, he probably tired of us
But when I die, find Tooka ass and I'ma beat 'em up

Ain't come along, hell nah, boy, I be with Smith & Wess'
Hit his chest, if that nigga run, fuck it, hit his back
Can't bring him back, now that nigga trendin' on the internet
You know how I move, I'm a fool, but I keep the tool
Stick and move when you was up in school
I was on the news, breakin' the rules
Bullets hit his shirt, knock him out his shoes
Thought he was cool, but he got hit the worst
You know how I do
You know how I rock, I'm from that block, boy, I keep a Glock
One up top, pass it to my shorty, if the police hot
She a thot, she just suck me up, we up in your car

Get his loin, get him whacked, if he ain't tap, we spinnin' back
No, I don't know Will Smith but I know 'bout the Men In Black
I know how that block work, I come straight from dealin' crack
Dissin' in them lyrics think it's sweet, no he won't ride for long
Throwin' bullets Pat' Mahomes, check the scope, we got it on
Chiraq always ride with chrome, .40 shells gon' crack his dome
No need to stand over him, they know for a fact he gone
And I got this bitch on fire, told her "Hide it or pass it on"
And your bitch can vouch, been with the gang, we don't cap in song
She want fame, she latchin' on, gon' blow me like a saxophone
Late night I might do one-sixty, swervin' through the traffic cone
You know how I rock, I'm from that block, boy, I keep a Glock
One up top, pass it to my shorty, if the police hot
She a thot, she just suck me up, we up in your car

But my nigga, he never folded

My homie laugh hard, heard a opp was dead, guess he got a killer's sense of humor
I heard that pussy been thinking 'bout death, well, that bullet gon' stick to his mind like a tumor
Catch him and change him, look how they played him, he only gangster up on his computer

But I got feelings
I catch you with him
I just might kill him
It feel like I'm doing the most
I like you, I'm letting you know
They been running from me they whole life
But I ain't into chasing no hoes
See, I cut this shit and just go
If I like you, I'm fucking you slow
Don't be scared 'cause I keep these guns 'round me
Never know who might come through the door
See, it started one day by the store
I was lurking, you know how that go
They was lacking, they know we at war
Hit the corner, I'm letting it blow
Boom, he fell, can't get up no more
I'm running, my forehead was soaked
I hear sirens, boy, they getting close
Don't  know how much far I can go
Told God forgive me, I'm wrong
Looked up, saw a bitch at the door
She waved, said, "Boy, come on"
I'm so happy, she don't even know
Made it in, then I hit the floor
Looked up, she was locking the door
Asked me do I still got my pole?
I looked down like, "You already know"
Look, my name Von, I know
And I'm from the O, I know
But I ain't do shit, I know
Don't worry, you good, they gone
This bitch was bad for sure
I gave her some racks for a coat
Asked her do she live alone?
She say, "Nah, he on his way home"
Bitch, fuck your nigga
Ho, fuck his feelings
You say you stayin'
See, ho, you trippin'
See, I'm a killer
But I got feelings
I catch you with him
I just might kill him
We been talkin', now we gettin' close
Her nigga a lame and he broke
When we fuckin', I love how you moan
You get T'd when they play my songs
My birthday the code to her phone
"Is he gone?" "Yeah, come on"
She call me when he not at home
So deep that I'm touchin' her soul
Now it feel like you leading me on
Got me all in they bed, this bitch wrong
I told her just leave him, she won't
I don't understand, what's wrong?
Bitch, stop playin' games, we grown
Looked up, heard, "Baby, I'm home"
Looked back, I was clutching my pole
She tellin' me, "No, Von, you wrong"
Bitch, fuck your nigga
Ho, fuck his feelings
You say you stayin'
See, ho, you trippin'
See, I'm a killer

The fuck I done lost
Huh? What?
You don't wanna be me 
Lil' nigga, you don't wanna be me 
You don't wanna be me 
Lil' nigga, you don't wanna be me 
It was hard in the streets 
Growin' up, it's either him or it's me 
It be hard in the streets 
Growin' up, it's either him or it's me 
You don't wanna be me 
Lil' nigga, you don't wanna be me 
You don't wanna be me 
Lil' nigga, you don't wanna be me 
It was hard in the streets 
Growin' up, it's either him or it's me 
It be hard in the streets 
Growin' up, it's either him or it's me 
It was hard just to make it 
Real shit, I ain't saying no fake shit 
Grew up 78th, grandma's basement 
Then we moved to Parkway, it was gated 
I'm like, "Damn, where we stayin'?" 
First night, gunshots, they ain't playin'
Had to sleep on the floor, we was on the first floor 
Boy stay away from that window 
See, this where it started 
Three floors, eight floors, them apartments 
Section 8, baby mommas and toddlers 
Killers, rapers and robbers 
See, I adapt to that shit, though
I had to fight everyday, I was still new 
They ain't know me, we ain't go to the same school 
Prolly mad 'cause I always had on new shoes 
See, that's what that crack do 
Stepdad sellin' drugs in the trap too 
Used to have his own place in the house too
Grandma used to say he was bad news, huh? 
Fuck that, I'm in high school 
Hyde Park, food fights in the lunch room 
Got jumped on the bus one time too 
Same day, Joey came up to the school too 
Then shots got to ringin' 
Caught Joey in the act, Gucci leaked him 
He got hit in the side but he breathin' 
Police right there, he was tweakin' 
But this how it started 
You don't wanna be me, I'm retarded
Locked up, sixteen for a robbery 
Momma, come see me, I'm sorry, please 
You don't wanna be me
All the shit I done in the streets 
All the shit I done lost, I done turned myself a boss
Can't believe I lost LilBossTee, damn

Lil' nigga, you don't wanna be me
It was hard in the streets 
Growin' up, it's either him or it's me
It be hard in the streets 
Growin' up, it's either him or it's me
Now life got different
I done did my time, I'm chillin'
2012 if you wanna be 'pecific
I lost O and Patoon, they killed me
See, that's change in the plans now
All that shit I said in jail ain't the plan now
Gotta get my hands down and pull that mask out
Get caught by King Von when you assed out
See, I'm tweakin' again
Lost Sheroid, I can't see him again
Now I'm back out skiin' again
I mean slide and them motherfuckin' hots now
Nines, .40s, extensions
Keep it movin' if you not the victim
Mind your business, we don't need no witness
Heard you got you a son, better kiss 'em
'Cause shit'll get crazy
He get caught and he say that you made 'em
Bullet holes in his mouth, straight face 'em
All the thoughts in his head, just erase 'em
Now back to the basics
Back booked, eight months, that's crazy
.45 Glock on me, no safety
Police hopped out, then chased me
I got caught, I was tweakin'
Back in jail with a celly, he stinkin'
Trying to tell me "Fuck them hoes," they tweakin'
God put you back in here for a reason
You don't wanna be me 
Lil' nigga, you don't wanna be me, nah
You don't wanna be me
Lil' nigga, you don't wanna be me 
It was hard in the streets 
Growin' up, it's either him or it's me 
It be hard in the streets 
Growin' up, it's either him or it's me
Back at it again
Took some time, now I'm back out the pen'
Lost my brothers LA and J-Money
House arrest and I'm totin' the Sig
Yeah, I'm on the band
Spin the block if you miss him again
Run up, hit his chest and his head
Roll 'em up, now we smoking the dead, damn

Leave him there, don't touch him, he gushin'
He was tough, he got shot, he pussy
Ambulance couldn't make it, he cushy, damn

Investigation room, this is not funny
I'm not hungry, you keep your bologna
Let me out 'cause they ain't got shit on me, 
Now me and Bernie slide
Got a bitch in the car, she just drivin'
We hop out, we was blastin' and wildin'
Guns so loud we ain't hearin' the sirens
But 12'nem was comin'
We ain't talkin', no time for discussion
Took a case, man, that bitch was a hunnid
Until she fuck on the opp, now she nothin'
Damn

They must've grew up in the burbs, you know that's out our ranges 
And all them niggas told on Rage, I'm like, "This shit outrageous" 
Lil' bro ain't know what he was doing, shit, he was just a baby 
See, where I'm from, they pass out guns and they don't pass out bundles 
And where I'm from, you got that sack, you better run, don't fumble
The first nigga that I popped was tall like Mutombo 
Even though I know how to box, this ain't no Royal Rumble 
Call his homie ass John Cena, he thought I didn't see him 
I upped this Glock then rocked his boat, now RIP Aaliyah 
A faithful man, but all these prints, I'm looking like a cheetah

Von
Man, it's three in the morning 
I'm thinking 'bout hitting this lick
I know what y'all thinking, I'm bogus
I'm supposed to be home with a bitch
Nah, see, I pay the rent, yeah, and I got a kid, damn
Plus, his pockets thick, the shit I'ma take he won't even miss
Now this shit a risk 'cause I asked about him and he play with stick
But it is what it is, if that nigga rich then I'm busting his shit
Yeah, see, even I flinch, nah, 'cause my finger itch
But here come his whip, but he ain't alone, he came with a bitch
See I ain't changing no plans, it is what it is, I am what I am
And if his bitch got some sense, when I up this blick his hoe better get down
From the look this bitch Burberry's down
From the look this bitch bands and Chanel
From back end she a ten on the scale
I think I might just take her as well
Let me stop being' silly, they going in the building, I'm going in with 'em
God please let him do what I say, if he don't, he gone be coming to get me
See, I'm high and a little bit of tipsy
But I'm focused, I'm thirsty, it's in me
Caught him lackin', put the Glock to his kidney
He start shaking and squirming and fidgeting
Told the bitch, "Don't look my way," if she do, her whole face gone be missing
And she stay with her face to the wall so I guess that she got the picture
I want the money, it could be so simple
And your jewelry shit look official
If he play, gun blow like a whistle
Pat him down, look, what? I found his pistol
Looked to the right 'cause I heard a giggle
Turned around and this bitch my sister
"Aye Kayla, why you dressed like a hooker?
And all the niggas that you fuck with be pussy?"
Damn, look, man, I'm sorry, I'm sorry for ruining' y'all party
But I'm keeping the money and jewelry
Just walk it off, you would thank me tomorrow
Man, these niggas be bitches, straight ho, flat out, he sissy
Play with King Von, he tripping
Find out where he stay next week, he missing
A nigga diss me, he won't do it again
I rob a nigga and do it again
I come through your block and kill two of your friends
It's do or die, is you gone ride? 
DJ on the beat so it's a bangerThey don't wanna see me make it

'Cause they smile in my face, turn my back, got picked for a case
Now it's me in the state , I swear I wouldn't want Feds
If the Feds woulda ran in the place
Now I'm lookin' like, "Damn" 
In the cell once again, finna have to post bail once again
F a lil' nigga tell one time he'll tell once again
Now I'm sittin' right, mail once again
On the block with the steel once again
I gotta get money, if you got it, kidnap your lil' bro like he Sunny
Buried my part' in that shit, had me sick to my stomach
Just the thought of that shit had me sick to my stomach
The opps send a diss like it's funny 
I pull up broad day with Glock like it's nothin'
I see 'em, I chase 'em, I catch 'em, he runnin'
Them bullets, they hurt, he got hit and he funny
That's everyday shit when you come from the jungle
I gotta get high, this shit takin' me under

Niggas keep sendin' threats online
And my man is the picture, the face, won't forget
I just iced out my mouth, VVS

If you reach for my chain, it's a box
On the block where it's hot with the Glocks lil' bro
In the drop with the drop on the opps, tryna run us to the shots
Gettin' popped in the spot
Mislined on the drive with my .40
Late night in the stu', I'm recordin'

Switch the car, hit 'em high , get caught, play it smart
Find you out, you will stop, hit the gas, livin' large

And I know the feds, they watchin' me too 
But niggas ain't stoppin' me, I'm sendin' this bitch to the moon

It's hard to trust 
We've been through too much shit, we can't give up
Wished it all on luck 
Her pussy just like goo, it got me stuck
Changed who I was, , and that's just because 
Think I'm in love , but I'm still a thug 
It's hard to trust 
We've been through too much shit, we can't give up
Wished it all on luck 
Her pussy just like goo, it got me stuck
Changed who I was, , and that's just because 
Think I'm in love , but I'm still a thug 
Baby it is what it is, I'm sorry I did what I did
You told me I made you look bad, I'll never do it again
Don't listen to none of your friends, cause they be all in my DM
Man, them hoes be setting you up, they be just wishing it's them
It was hard to trust 
But we done came this far we can't give up 
, whatever it is you want, I make it up
Just know we ain't breaking up, don't know why people hate on us
Just tryna tack this paper up, she stayed ten toes when shit got tough
You remember that time, we was in the bed and the police was outside
Stayed by my side, grabbed my gun, since then knew you was gon' ride
You remember that time, a nigga tried you in the studio and almost died
Get one in his mind
Ain't going nowhere lil girl', this shit for life
It's hard to trust 
We've been through too much shit, we can't give up
Wished it all on luck 
Her pussy just like goo, it got me stuck
Changed who I was, , and that's just because 
Think I'm in love , but I'm still a thug 
It's hard to trust 
We've been through too much shit, we can't give up
Wished it all on luck 
Her pussy just like goo, it got me stuck
Changed who I was, , and that's just because 
Think I'm in love , but I'm still a thug Lyrics from snippet
Man, these niggas hoes 
I already know 
Tell him drop the lo' 
He gon' get exposed 
Too real, I cannot go 
Plus, I keep a pole 
My chain white and gold 
Wrist so cold, I'll make it snow 
Rap beef turn to homicide 
You diss then we gon' slide 
He got shot but he ain't died 
Sike, you know he died 
I fell back and got my bands up 
Still I'll make you put your hands up 
I'm with Edogg, he gon' blam somethin' 
Free D.Rose, he ain't tell nothin'
How you real? Your homie just got killed 
And you still ain't did nothin'
You the type to get booked and tell on your friends
And then act like you ain't said nothin' 
I be dammed, niggas know who I am 
We got that call, and spin the Benz, we call 'em 2 A.M 
Niggas think it's sweet 
Since I got rich like I won't shoot at them 
I'm on the block, still fuck a broke nigga bitch 
Boy, I don't give a shit
Ice so cold I make her snitch
Know who my business is
I done shot so many men I think I'm 50 Cent
I ask once won't ask again
Know who you dealing with
If I crack once won't crack again
Not with that feeling shit No bond, I was on the run, bet you can't relate
Toting guns, shooting shit for fun, bet you can't relate
Locked up, couldn't see my son, I bet you can't relate
Jumped the opps, ain't no one on ones, I bet you can't relate
That nigga told, he ain't hold it down, bet you can't relate
He broke the code, don't come back around, bet you can't relate
Only time he tough when he up in the crowd, I bet you can't relate
You did that before but what you gon' do now? I bet you can't relate
Back then, it was crack and I had a MAC-10
No lacking, pistol-packing, I got this black skin
If he acting then we reacting and knocking off Brims
I got some action, I get my black mask and get my black Timbs
They asking questions, I’m acting clueless, don't know what happened
They know it's King Von, shorty the smoothest, but, he a savage
Had too much baggage, that's why my last bitch, I had to trash her
Old bitch nigga only flashy up in a casket
No bond, I was on the run, bet you can't relate
Toting guns, shooting shit for fun, bet you can't relate
Locked up, couldn't see my son, I bet you can't relate
Jumped the opps, ain't no one on ones, I bet you can't relate
That nigga told, he ain't hold it down, bet you can't relate
He broke the code, don't come back around, bet you can't relate
Only time he tough when he up in the crowd, I bet you can't relate
You did that before but what you gon' do now? I bet you can't relate
It's busses and I see them coming, they up to something
No running, I keep me something, I get to dumping
Now if I slump him and then I slump him and then I slump him
Now my house haunted with all these demons, that this shit come with
And when my homie shot in the stomach, it hurt my stomach
No matter how long the beef it cooking, bitch, I still want it
And all these diamonds, they dripping on me, still, I feel lonely
James Johnson, Jerome Howard, and Odee Perry
No bond, I was on the run, bet you can't relate
Toting guns, shooting shit for fun, bet you can't relate
Locked up, couldn't see my son, I bet you can't relate
Jumped the opps, ain't no one on ones, I bet you can't relate
That nigga told, he ain't hold it down, bet you can't relate
He broke the code, don't come back around, bet you can't relate
Only time he tough when he up in the crowd, I bet you can't relate
You did that before but what you gon' do now? I bet you can't relateI do the dash on the cops

Lay down, I like that girl from the waist down
I don't think that we should waste time 
I heard it was good through the grapevine 
Huh? What?

I heard that you got a great mind
I don't think we need to waste time 
She fell in love with a shooter 
I caught that girl playin' with my Glock 
She askin' me what is Tooka 
Just know that we smoke him a lot

I'm quick to spray down your block 
Can't stop 'cause twelve too hot

Play with Grandson and they gon' hurt you
Shoot at the chest, don't miss
We wanna stretch 'em
He gone, nigga, who next?

About two shorties
With two 40s
DJ on the beat, so it's a banger
Von
Late night, he was creeping
Just a young hot shorty tryna kill for no reason
Heart colder than a freezer 
He was raised in the jungle, had more stripes than a zebra 
Auntie used to beat him 
She was high off the C, she ain't even used to feed him
And the teachers couldn't teach him 
He said the words looked funny, it was too hard to read 'em 
Watch out, he reaching, boom
One shot from the Glock, nigga whole shit leaking 
My fault, he tweaking 
Drug deal gone wrong, big homie tried to cheat him 
Don't touch him, just leave him 
Had his best friend with him, lil' bro couldn't believe it 
See he heard about the killings
But it's his first time seeing it, he ain't even wanna see it 
No more school 
Shorty got a new Glock and he acting a fool 
And he don't shoot pool 
But he keep a stick on him, he like "What we finna do?" 
Best friend be blue

Shorty head fucked up, he got something to prove

Lil' folks getting high, he just popped him a pill 
"Ooh, let's do a drill" 
That's what he told his best friend, but his friend tryna chill
He said, "Nah, I'm cool" 
I'ma fall back today, I got a bitch coming through 
But you can do you 
Passed little bro the keys, said the car by the school 
You know shorty don't play 
He hopped right out his seat, put the Glock to his face 
Ayy, bitch, you acting gay 
I just need you to drive, I know where he stay 
So now they en route 
They pulled to the crib in the back of the house 
He say, "Shorty, get out" 
After you catch this one, you gon' have all the clout 
Shorty don't trust him 
Shorty say fuck him 
Whole time, shorty don't even know, this the same nigga killed his brother 
See shorty ass a sucker 
He hop out, he say fuck it 
He ran up and got to bustin'

You a hardworkin' sitter like a bench player
You ain't even in the game, you was back then 
And I'm onto the money, I'll be back then 
Talkin' money then you talkin' my language
I keep a small circle but we all on the same shit
And you ain't gettin' money, nigga you should be ashamed
'Cause it's plenty to be made, how the fuck you gon' explain it?
You broke niggas gon' starve where I come from 
And you gotta have heart where I come from 
Ain't no handout, nigga it's a cold world
So you gotta go hard where I come from
Get-get-get off your ass and go get it
You want some go get it
I witnessed the shit ain't gon' come to you
I'm tryna get me some millions, if you talkin' business we got somethin' in common, I fuck with you
'Member days I was broke and ain't have shit 
Wearin’ hand-me-down clothes it was nasty
And I shoot it by myself, I don't pass it
I'm thumbin' through these hunnids it's a passion 
And I don't wanna talk about nothin' else 
If it ain't about money then it's somethin' else 
And I don't wanna talk about nothin' else 
If it ain't about money, I don't talk about it 
And I don't wanna talk about nothin' else 
If it ain't about money then it's somethin' else 
And I don't wanna talk about nothin' else 
If it ain't about money, I don't talk about it 
I'm committed to the money like a marriage 
Get the M's and repeat it like a parrot
And I'm loyal to the money and the money only 
Keep a ratchet 'cause I keep a lotta money on me 
I'm the hottest in the sun, can't compare to me
'Cause I've been on fire like a lighter and some kerosene
And I ain't tryna kick it if you broke you might embarrass me
I'm in another brackets, so you need to stop comparin’ me 
Then I jump off the porch, I'ma shoot shit 
I was hungry, I was sick and tired of strugglin' 
Graduated to a mil', I feed you
I do it for my people, as long as the money still comin' in
Whole lot of blood, sweat and tears in this shit
I did years in this shit, it ain't promise, it's possible
I cannot lie I be real with this shit, I be livin' this shit
My success im responsible
Bitch you could fall off any day now 
But it's your own fault if you stay down 
And I ain't tryna talk to no feds 
I don't know what the fuck to tell you 
And I don't wanna talk about nothin' else 
If it ain't about money then it's somethin' else 
And I don't wanna talk about nothin' else 
If it ain't about money, I don't talk about it 
And I don't wanna talk about nothin' else 
If it ain't about money then it's somethin' else 
And I don't wanna talk about nothin' else 
If it ain't about money, I don't talk about it Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been releasedYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

The jet just cleared now
I don't 'posed to be here, where I'm from, they kicked me down
You can't be deceitful, shoot you right between your eyes
I done seen some shit that got some bloodstain in my eyes
Met a couple niggas in the sandbox, made some ties
Put the vests in the light, put the Rollies in the sky
We was livin' a whole lie, thought gangsters made it out
T-Roy want word of mouth, true story, this not clout
Told my killers one way out
600 never doubt 'em, in the hood like a stout
Roll a Backwood full of opps, do a hit, then we out
Quarter milli' in the bank, did my thing, get my props
And lil' bro tryna bang, told him slang, fuck the opps
Lost four-o, I tried to dodge
City on fire like a carpet
Told my niggas silence while we mobbin'
This that hold your lighter for the stars
This that catchin' redrum with my Glock
This that movin' as one get us far
On a jet with Celine, I'm barkin'
Shit ain't what it seem when you all in
Jet just cleared now
I don't 'posed to be here, where I'm from, they kicked me down
You can't be deceitful, shoot you right between your eyes
I done seen some shit that got some bloodstain in my eyes
Met a couple niggas in the sandbox, made some ties
Put the vests in the light, put the Rollies in the sky
We was livin' a whole lie, thought gangsters made it out
T-Roy want word of mouth, true story, this not clout
Told my killers one way out
Bitch, I'm back down
I don't 'posed to be here, how the fuck did I get out?
You ain't see it comin', my own bitch counted me out
Had my knees on the ground, had my head to the clouds
Trust that man without no doubt
I'm in that bitch, I'm throwin' hands with the crowd
You wasn't answerin', I called the phone, I got the dial
Don't know who I'm talkin' about, bitch, that owl
Now, bitch, get down, nah, bitch, get out
Can't settle for shit, I'm steady thinkin' to myself, damn
I lost my best friend, can I have saved him if I was there? Damn
That was the worst feeling I ever felt
And I broke down to myself and I cried on them steps, yeah
The jet just cleared now
I don't 'posed to be here, where I'm from, they kicked me down
You can't be deceitful, shoot you right between your eyes
I done seen some shit that got some bloodstain in my eyes
Met a couple niggas in the sandbox, made some ties
Put the vests in the light, put the Rollies in the sky
We was livin' a whole lie, thought gangsters made it out
T-Roy want word of mouth, true story, this not clout

Timmy Da HitManLyrics from Snippet
DJ on the Beat so it's a banger
I'm just trying to make it out of the streets now
I'm just trying to make it through the week
I'm just trying to make it out the streets now
I'm just trying to make it through the week
You know the trenches ain't no place for the weak now
You gon' starve if your ass don't eat
They hold you back you can't make it to your peak now
I swear to God, boy, your ass gon' see
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Gotta stay strong 'cause my granny getting weak now
I got that call now a nigga can't sleep
And I been stuck in Miami for a week now
I'm like, "God, why you doing this shit to me?"
You...What, what?
We started this shit man
We fathered this shit 
Did a lot of dirty myself
Dirty
30 on me shoot ‘em like Steph Curry
Shells get to raining
Getting wet up huh?
Fall and yo ass won’t get up 
Bitch i get busy with choppas and glizzies
I’m riding’ through the city
This Glock got no safety
Keep that bitch with me
So please do not tempt me
I squeeze ‘til it’s empty
You thinking you crazy
Bad bitch from another country
Foreign
Slam dunk all in her pussy
Scoring
Kick her out on to the next
She boring
Finna pull up on her friends
Hoes going
Bands on me money won’t fold
Damn
Leprechaun, where is me gold bands
Can’t catch this drip
You got no hands
I ain’t got opps
I got all fans
I be sliding on niggas straight patching them
You ain’t wanna die why you lack with them
Hopping up out of them astro vans
Catch yo ass boy you can’t hide from them
We dangerous
Tooka man smoke him like angel dust
Boy you ain’t gang
You a stain you can’t hang with us
Glizzies on every gang member that came with us
Aim and just spray at them niggas that ain’t with us
How you gone war with a god, a beast
You don’t need guns you need heart, you weak
Boy we will dust yo ass off, sweeping
You don’t want smoke with my squad, you tweaking
Tell them niggas they don’t want no war wit us 
They don’t want no war wit us naw
Tell them niggas they don’t want no war wit us
Boy we some monsters, savages, and warriors
Whole lot of wild ass shorties, babies
.35 stuffed in a .40, KD
Naw we don’t need no aim, say what
Hitting niggas up close range, lay ups
Two hands i’m rocking the metal
I’m  hot like the devil
I bury yo block like a shovel
Hit yo ass all in yo neck now yo head on yo chest
Look like olympic gold medals
Switching gears, swerving through traffic
Stop us
I can switch gears on my ratchet
Choppa
Boy when we roll up we bussing
Blocka
Knock all that meat out yo fucking taco
Hollows just spinning like cyclones
FaceTime a nigga like iPhone
Put a pretty opp bitch in a morgue huh
Call that bitch drop dead gorgeous damn
I’m heartless bitch you can call me the tin man
Going against me is like crawling through quicksand
Draco be sparking and barging through bricks man
Some call me Grandson and some call me Hitman
Bitch some call me Hitman
Bitch some call me Hitman
Some call me Grandson and some call me Hitman
But some call me Hitman
How you gone war with a god, a beast
You don’t need guns you need heart, you weak
Boy we will dust yo ass off, sweeping
You don’t want smoke with my squad, you tweaking
Tell them niggas they don’t want no war wit us 
They don’t want no war wit us naw
Tell them niggas they don’t want no war wit us
Boy we some monsters, savages, and warriors

        As I lay down to rest
Please realize Kind David I did my best
On the six points I do swear
Forever for life I do bare
The pledge of honor to you from me
The beloved King of all the Gs
Your blood was spilled and tears were shed
I remember this and what you said
A G is a G and always a G
I give you honor forever to you the King of me
4.10 G forever for always
David's Prayer should be said by all Foot Soldiers 6 times a week in front of a Knight
I took a oath and I did what I did Now he a whole Clown A body gon fall down
Reload, spin back
Make sure that they all down 
I got the strategy I got a Dead opp on a Album nigga Don’t get put in a gallery 
Blood for blood Homi for Homi Body for body we Spot em, red dot em
We shot em We Got em My homie only twenty-four, he got a Bentley truck
Cut the sprinklers on before them boys try wet you up
I made a pledge My word is honor If I'm on a drill somebody getting killed so many Opps Them bodies gon drop
I made a pledge that They gon be dead
Foenem caught Tooka ass gettin' off the bus Bleed Em
