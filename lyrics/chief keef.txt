And his bitch saw my pistol and touched it, I'm like, "What you touched that for?"
Unless you finna shoot some shit for So
Don't touch my pistol
'Cause I don't wanna have to blow ya
'Cause I don't wanna have to go to jail
Don't stalk me now, got a Glock on me now

The block hot, the cops hot
Finna go to New Orleans to the Mardi Gras
She a hot thot, she was already dropped
I'm tryna see if money love me or not
But I think money love me a lot
Try to take my shit, let the chopper flop
Like grah grah, grah grah
Chopper going for 'em like rah rah
Like ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
All these niggas talking like they trap god
Till they ass get robbed
All these niggas talk like they trap gods, talking like they so hard, they ain't never sold hard
And I know that I'm a rapper, I can have thirty niggas up in your yard
And I sip too much damn lean and you would think I always had a cold
And his bitch saw my pistol and touched it, I'm like, "What you touched that for?"
Unless you finna shoot some shit for So
Don't touch my pistol

All these bitches chasing after D 
Tell these bitches, “Chase after cheese”

Who raised me, my momma, granny 
No actor, but I need a Grammy 
Taxing niggas Uncle Sammy

Police can't come through the door, cause I'm lockin' it
Unless they got a warrant, they just talkin' shit
Fed house still doors why ya'll talk this shit?
You tryna catch a nigga slippin'
Crusin' in a rental
Make your bitch forget her business

Aye man look God dammit 
Aye man 
You know I'm a, I'm a trend setter 
This is what I do you know
Niggas take the shit I do

You know what I'm saying, take what I do
You know what I'm saying, they put it in themselves
And they run with it, God dammit 
You know? Ok so look

When they see the serial number right 
And they come back to a nigga
That be me you know 
I started in the basement, now I'm in a mansion
I took Ben Franklin, and held him for ransom
I lived with my granny, now I got 10 bedrooms
I rolled in a putt putt, now my car got so much leg room
I turned nothing into something, I am a MacGyver
And the way I do this shit, I am not a tryer
You say you got that wockhardt, I might be your buyer
Nigga think he going crazy, I might be your driver
You try shit, I buy shit
Get the blicky, It's lightning
No 30, It's Mike Vic
Thats 52 shots in this hundred
Cause if you fill it up it cannot breath
This cash in my pocket cannot leave
Get seasoned and fall just like leaves
Girl your nigga wanna ball just like me!
My whole fucking body numb, larocaine
I'm a motherfucking boss, you're a lame
How I bowl through these niggas, you're a lane
Knock your neck down your chest, now you're a chain
I started in the basement, now I'm in a mansion
I took Ben Franklin, and held him for ransom
I lived with my granny, now I got 10 bedrooms
I rolled In a putt putt, now my car got so much leg room
I turned nothing into something, I am a MacGyver
And the way I do this shit, I am not a tryer
You say you got that wockhardt, I might be your buyer
Nigga think he going crazy, I might be your driver
I'm going so crazy they should put me in a psych ward
She eat me in my Louis shorts, she bite shorts
The weed make me project, there's science in the weed
Let a nigga try me, he be dying with them trees
You think I'm flying on this glo wood, aladdin
Treat my life like Orlando, Its magic
Play this shit up in the club, Its tragic
You ain't getting money, I can see it, no statics
Up to the top, I climb and climb
No cash for me to see, then I'm going blind
I'm gliding like a GLOverboard, I don't need no wheels
I don't think its purple rain if I don't see the seal
I started in the basement, now I'm in a mansion
I took Ben Franklin, and held him for ransom
I lived with my granny, now I got 10 bedrooms
I rolled In a putt putt, now my car got so much leg room
I turned nothing into something, I am a MacGyver
And the way I do this shit, I am not a tryer

Fucking around with my green and
I ain't friendly bitch, I'm greenly

And sometimes I be fucking with other bitches
Walk in the bank like give me all of my riches
Remember when I was broke but now I'm full of richness
I still got niggas on my hit list
I still got bitches on my to-do list
And I still got niggas on my boot list
Her majesty came through, after we came through banging
Little bitty boy ain't have no business gang banging
Bought a little bitty toy and a big Tonka truck just to hang in
Bought some credit guns and bought a bunch of clothes just to hang with
Cause...

Even though she'll make a good mom
She said she never met a met a good nigga
I said never met a good cop
She suck on that dick like a push pop
She get mad as hell when I pull out
She knows that there's only one Tunechi
She be like Weezy I love Tunechi

Then I play with that pussy like a Rubix
Between me and you she call me sexy chocolate
And I swear that pussy like fudge to me

You was smoking blunts, can't smoke with me
You was rolling blunts, can't roll for me
Girl you can't even hit the club with me
You can't walk in the house with the dub with me
Shorty said she want to rule the world with me

But I told her that her time is turn to shit

I need money to do good deeds
I need money I got good needs
She take off her shoe she get good feet
She give me head, yeah she got good knees
She started runnin' she got good cleats
Then she started talking about she love me
I hit her ass up with that Worldstar
I Lollapalooza her good spot
She swallow the kids I say "good girl"
Even though she'll make a good mom
She said she never met a met a good nigga
I said never met a good cop
She suck on that dick like a push pop
She get mad as hell when I pull out
She knows that there's only one Tunechi
She be like Weezy I love Tunechi
I be like baby don't confuse me
Then I play with that pussy like a Rubix

Catch 'em, can't catch 'em
My car's too special
My house too big
So thots keep stretchin
And I live there by myself
Me and a lot of weapons
Money to buy whatever
Surrounded by lots of protectionFuck boy said he want beef, slide
His ass gon' be traumatized
I'mma be feeling sorry momma wise
Cause I can't trust niggas, I got a lot of eyes
Gun go bang bang, money machine go beep
Car go skr skr, cock go skeet skeet
Credit card go swipe swipe, watch my watch bling bling
On that road runner shit, meep meep
You ain't smoking dope, your weed got plenty seeds in it
I'm rolling around the town with this and glizzy meeting
Glo Gang bitch, you know that we go plenty weed men
Fifteen thots in this car like I got plenty seats in
Fourteen hundred for this belt, fuck with no more damn Fendi beatings
And I don't have any reasons
Seventeen shots in this 45, 50 in the Glock, hundred in the chop
Let's see how many kills we can get, Black Ops
Bitch I'm so dope that I'm gon' kill that shit, crack rock
Niggas stay sneak dissing, we gon' start throwing bullets like rocks
I ain't shit when I ain't have shit, couple grand on some kicks
Never touched fifty thousand dollars before that's why I'm playing with it
Bang
Fuck boy said he want beef, slide
His ass gon' be traumatized
I'mma be feeling sorry momma wise
Cause I can't trust niggas, I got a lot of eyes
Gun go bang bang, money machine go beep
Car go skr skr, cock go skeet skeet
Credit card go swipe swipe, watch my watch bling bling
On that road runner shit, meep meepBoy, violence

Niggas comin' through with that violence
Niggas mix two with that Molly
Ain't got nothin' to do with that money

Niggas come and deal with that violence
As far that gun that's silence
Niggas come and deal with that violence
Ain't know nothin' about it

Murder a nigga off of that donkey
If it ain't nothin' funny 'bout money

Give it to however you want it
I am 2pac for the moment
Violence
Got no love, violence
Boy, violence
Violence
See we are, far from takin' flicks with guns
I murder the beat with the sticks and drums
Break bread with brothers, turnin' bricks to crumbs
Then we put it in the mix to addict the young
This is somethin' you must understand
Music can just kill a man
A mean poker face and wild card in my hand
Tone Trump out of Phila-stan
Middle of the summer we don't chill
Them West Philly mahfuckers kill at will
Fresh Prince of the ghetto man I feel like Will
Only workin' three jobs just to pay them bills
I could kill 'em with the gun rather kill 'em with my mind
My little sister pregnant but my brother doing time
My baby boy squeal but my baby mom stressin'
I only fear Allah but the uzi on the dresser
Bang, bang like my hittas from the Chi
Niggas looking rich but they barely getting by
We was selling crack when they was selling lies
Al my young bulls violent, you can see it in their eyes
I stood tall when that fuckboy folded
I'm sober now but I was high when I wrote this
Dreams like Martin but I'm strapped like Malcolm
My plug from the A got me ballin' like a Falcon
Violence
Got no love, iolence
Boy, violence
Violence
Boy
Say, say
I'll write a life sentence on a stick pen
Real rappers record on yellow tape then
Cop a plea all the 
Institution that allows it to make men
Gon' turn it up for the cops too
It's still a crime to be silent
So speak up and get violent if you got to
Violence
Got no love, violence

        Imma come and get you with the seat way back
I'm a rich nigga but I came from way back
We could record all moments and press play back
I couldn't find you like a needle in the hay stack
I couldn't find you like sale on a whole store
We can hit every city on a tour bus
We can hit every state on the jet plane
I swear this shit won't be over 'till the cat sings
I know you know that a cat can't sing though
You are not every bird, girl you a flamingo
Then I hit it on the head she like bingo
At six flags "Aight let's hit giant drop", she like please no
I had to hit your heart with a repo
I called Michael Blackson for the scene though
Babe what you mad for, I'm Mr. Meaner
You know when I get inside her I'm Mr. Cleaner
Bang bang
Bang bangI'm on it, I'm on it
I'm on the block and it's pumpin', it's pumpin', it's pumpin'
I'm in the kitchen, it's jumpin', it's jumpin', it's jumpin'
This kush is loud, it's tumblin', it's tumblin', it's tumblin'
This da squad, we comin', we comin', we comin'
Extra clips we dumpin', we dumpin', we dumpin'
Bitch niggas stop runnin', stop runnin', stop runnin'
Your whole hood, we stompin', we stompin', we stompin'
This da squad we comin', we comin', we comin'
We Brick Squad, we runnin'
In my pocket, all 100's
If it ain't about that money, everything else is nothin'
 in my Louis, everything else is rugby
Spent 20 bands for my ice, that's why she wanna fuck me
In my bedroom I spent the Rollex
Livin' room cost Polo bed
I'm that nigga, you know that
This .40, don't make me blow that
I throw money, hoes know that

I was doin' that shit before that
Red beams where you nose at?

Silencer on the gun, no shoes off

Five bricks in the trunk, five goons with pumps
Five hoes that slut, I stack racks and I nut

You can tell I got guap by the look of my jeans
That bitch know I can't tell the time 'cause this ice in my watch

No, they can't hold you back

I ain't think of it like that, I ain't think of it like that
I ain't think of it like that, I ain't think of it like that
I ain't think of it like that, I ain't think of it like that
I ain't think of it like that, I ain't think of it like that
Y'all ain't think when we come through sending shots, we was coming right back
I ain't think smoking this loud pack would have me coughing like that
I ain't think when I pop this pill, it'd have me talking like that
I ain't think when I sip this lean, it'd have me walking like that
I ain't think when I bought my car, it'd have basketball seats like that
I ain't think when she get in my car, that she was gon' top me like that
She ain't think when I gave her this cock, that she would start walking like that
And he ain't think we was gon' pull up and get to sparking like that
I swear I think I'm one with my lows
I think I'ma put my bros over hoes
I think I'ma get that sack, go buy some clothes
I think I'm gon' get that sack, go buy some gold
Call Johnny Dang, like, "Put some stones in my charm"
I think I'ma need some stones on my arm
I think I'ma need a pond for my lawn
Full of big ass fish in my backyard like yawns
I think they want me go back like I was
I know I'm gon' get sack just to flex, ayy
Pull up on a bitch, I'm engaged with one of my ex, ayy
And that's a show and my ex name fifty grand, ayy
Pulled off, they like, "Sosa, thy the man," ayy
I ain't think of it like that, I ain't think of it like that

And I'm hoppin' in the Rari but I'm wearing skinnys

I had bitches way back when I smoked them skimpys
Put a bullet in your heart and make that bitch empty
And the way this bitch spit, this the illest MC
Smack a nigga bodyguard, I feel like Nipsey
I just told a bitch peace, It's like a hippy
And I had to bring my pipe, cuz shit sound iffy

Then I walk up to your girl and she asking me to share
Bao
Yo
I'm hungry where them cheetos at
They stay biting like where them mosquitos at
I'm on point like an elbow
Hands red like elmo
My mama said 'have you had enough?'
I look and I said 'no ma'am'
I go ham in the grocery store
Orange fanta and takis
Riding around with my allowance
So nobody can stop me
All the kids wanna be him
Go crazy when they see him
My mom hit the ATM
Cuz she know I need them
Hot Cheetos and takis
That's my favorite snack
Bought 'em with my own money
I don't give 'em back
Mama says "slow down
Boy you bout to blow"
First I'm finna get mo'
You should drive me to the sto'
Hot Cheetos and takis
No one ever stops me
Got an ice flow and I'm super cold
Everybody knows that I'm so dope
I say yes to takis
And you say no to cheetos
I can have them then
And you can stick to fritos
Ben 10 need a snack
Somebody give it to him
Or I might snap
Like what my fingers doing
Yeah you know what's next
You can't stop me
I hit them with the flex
And eat some takis
I'm getting snacks on snacks on snacks
Yeah I'm eating all of them
By the way if you don't know J got skills flow cold like a snow cone
Boatloads of them skittles starburst fritos and doritos
But nothing can compare to them H-O-T cheetos
And them takis
So watch me go hammer
With my snack first
And I chew my food
Cuz you know I got them manners
And then I start to dance and I dougie to the floor
And now I need a snack headed to the corner store
For some...Put that on my daughter OTF til the grave, gun play
Runnin from me and shots broad day, y’all fake
Better wake up smelling coffee, wale
Down to the ground shot on face
Stacking lace, better play your cards right. Playin' spades
See you niggas is some slaves and my gun be the case
And someday, I mean one day Imma be at the Grammy's trying to fuck Beyonce
On the leg, get your bitch, she on me, steady rubbing on my dick, she gon' get me horny
And hooray, I'm screaming hooray for these niggas, catch outside, I've been gone all day

You said I ain't getting money, what you talking about?

You got a very freaky momma
We can do a slumber

She's a very dark bitch, I saw her on the corner

Xbox shit, I'm the only one
