Wish I could bring Pun back, blaow, nigga, run that
'Til they let Rowdy out, we gon' let these semis out
Wish I could bring Stacks back, Kyle, let the MAC clap
'Til they free Biggavel, gotta give you niggas hell

HBA, gold fronts, let me guess, "So trill"?
Nigga, this is New York, make the wrong move
And the goons let the tool spark, work hard and move salt
8 Ball like pool holes, cracked like the pavement
Diesel like the gas station, trap out the basement
Blow in the Pyrex, mask on our faces
Let 'em act sketch, but this lead will erase 'em, on gang

You thinking about playing around with my respect
I'm making it blaow  I'm making it blaow 
Creeping through the darkness
Better think smart, kid
I'm finna spark shit
I'm creeping through the darkness
Like a demon inside of a mosh pit 
I could never go back, I'm too deep in
Tweaking, solo marine
Put a bullet to your pillow, you sleep
Security breach, paranoid fingers get bleached 
Nightmares, I'm not dreaming, I feel like a demon
These motherfucking think I'm cold
I just sit back, light up a backwood
But that's after I run up and kick in your door
It's a go, I don't have a choice, compelled to
The struggling pain, yeah that's what they made
Now let me show what I'm propelled to
Satan said sorry, we even withheld you
Had to link up with 6ix9ine
Heard a voice speak from a dump room
Said "6ix9ine" about six times
Then the candle went out and the horror went through
I'm breaking it down 
A scam, I heard that boy running around with the packs
So I'm taking him down 
Oh my gosh, they live by the cold 
You know we ain't making a sound 
You thinking about playing around with my respect
I'm making it blaow  I'm making it blaow 
I'm breaking it down 
A scam, I heard that boy running around with the packs

Crazy! That's it, That’s all I gotta say, crazy

She call me baby , she got me fucked up 
I'm not your baby , I just want the nut, ho!
Bitch must be crazy, do this shit on the daily
Pull up Mercedes, with a bitch from Haiti
These niggas fugazi 
They talking crazy 
Talking 'bout how they made me 
Saying how they gon' stave me 
All that hot shit don't faze me 
Pull up a coupe, shoot out the roof 
Beaming at you , wet you like cooch 
TEKASHI69 from that Scum fucking squad
Fuck your bitches, fuck the law

Look in my eyes , I give no fucks
I fuck shit up, I'm busting nuts 
She call me baby , she got me fucked up 
I’m not your baby , I just want the nut, ho!
Dices que eres gangster, pero del dinero de antes
Maldito come mierda, ten cuida’o, no te atragante' 
Tamo’ desconectados que hasta podemos dar el cante
Con tu puta en el Ferrari, jalapeño, trap picante
Piquete traficante, mi puta está arrogante
Tratando con los árabes, hoe, bricks en el turbante
Mi dinero se expande , mi chain extra brillante 
Yo no soy tu baby, hoe, sólo quiero el gaznate
El juez me quiere encerrar
Dizque no sabe diferenciar entre el bien y el mal
I give no fuck, I give no fuck
Puta, look in my eyes
Yung Beef furcia Tekashi 6ix9ine
Bee-bee-bee-beef boy
Look in my eyes , I give no fucks
I fuck shit up, I'm busting nuts 
She call me baby , she got me fucked up 
I'm not your baby , I just want the nut, ho!
Look in my eyes , I give no fucks
I fuck shit up, I'm busting nuts 
She call me baby , she got me fucked up 
I’m not your baby , I just want the nut, ho!Niggas ain't scum, fold fit through the drum
You only got that for fun, all of that frontin' for what?
I might pull up in a Lamb, run up on your mans
Pop a nigga like a Xan, when I run up with my clan
Niggas know me, .45, 6ix stay with it
Aim at your motherfucking fitted, nigga, we with it
30 clip in the Smith, knock the nigga off his pivot
Watch your eyes fake the dump when this gun fucking buck
Concrete shoes and all, body lay under the tongue
Yeah, we rep that fucking six, but I finger fuck that nine
They throw dirt all on my name, spell TEKASHI69
Went to jail, spent the case, nigga, I ain't doing time
Feel whole weight, in my set, we held 30, free the 9 
Niggas don't want no smoke
See them, they choke, buck 50 through his nose
Then I take a nigga bitch
Head to the trap, all my niggas giving gold
All my niggas trained to go
Upping the pole, TTG, we let it go
Whack a nigga like a mole
40 CAL through his soul, then we hit the road
You don't really want no smoke
You don't really got no hope
Boy, you know I got that pole
Everyday and I know
Everyday it's a go
You don't really want no war
Better double lock your door
When you come knock with force
Knocking you off your horse
Then run out and hop the porch
Won't peep no more
.38 baby, .38 raised me
But I won't let my .38 change me
Gotta come up, won't sleep 'till I make it
Gotta get out, I'm stuck in the Matrix
It's time I change up your thought
Better think fast, I'm aiming the torch
Ain't taking a loss, I'm making a cross
I'm taking it all, so take it no more
The way I move like Mike in his prime
Rise up and I'm taking what's mine
I move to the left, I move to the right
I step back and I shoot out your light
And thank you for days and thank you for weeks
Thinking it's sweet, I'll shoot up your street
Been praying a lot, but I don't really know if I'm praying to God
But the praying don't stop
Don't have dreams, I have nightmares
Said I don't sleep, so I won't leave
I pull it out, I don't fight fair
Said I won't leave, so bitch hold theseScum Gang!

Squeeze the trigger 'til my hand shake
Flip a nigga like a pancake 
Crack the nigga like a crab leg
Bring the drum where his fam lay
 Prolly bag a hoochie, mane

You talk a lot, you a chatterbox, but real niggas lay low 
Real niggas lay low, real-real niggas lay low

Righteous P with the TEC-9 and the AR with a scope 
This ScumChad from that Scum Gang with 69 in that load
.44 got a long nose, hit a nigga in his headband
Make a nigga do a backflip, sticking into those corn-rolls
Regular or long-nosed, see, my plug died when my heart froze
Real niggas, they lay low, keep your bread up with the 5-0
Keep your head up, bunch of eyes, though
Keep my head up but my eyes low
Fuck a heads up, we don't do those
Leave a nigga bloody in school clothes
Wallah dropped out like, "Fuck school"
She suck my dick and my nuts too

I need a 6 with the kit on it, .38, rubber grip on it
Scum Gang, all my niggas riders, cut coke with the Benefiber
Word around my side of town, your bitch is sly so I slid inside her
I made a promise to my mama that I'll get these dollars
I load the clip into the smith and flip 'em, all these bottles
Money grow on trees, I'm living in the forest
How you feel about these niggas?—Man, don't get me started
Rocking and rolling and rolling and rocking
I lay low from plain clothes, they patrol my block
I gotta get these pesos, I'm stacking all my guap
Do this for my Scum niggas, man, they all I got, uh
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But this MAC-11 take his soul
Tag his toe, burn the pipe
They don't know, they learn tonight
Tie him up, pour some gasoline on him, light him up
Five Xan bars with the lean got me high as fuck
Wish I could bring Pun back, blaow, nigga, run that
'Til they let Remmy out, we gon' let these semis out
Wish I could bring Stacks back, Chad, let that MAC clap
'Til they free Biggavel, gotta give you niggas hell
Blicky make that nigga yell, beam hit his knees
Made him scream, when that nigga fell, shootout with the law
Or the morgue 'fore I sit in jail, niggas say they love me
But I can see it in these niggas eyes, they don't wish me well
I don't need their company, they smilin' when a nigga fell
Seein' that I'm poppin' in the shots, I'm like the Durell
Order stitches for these snitches, dead men tell no tales
Diggin' ditches for these niggas, toss 'em in, so well
Drive-by, leave him in the street, nigga, road kill
HBA, gold fronts, let me guess, "So trill"?
Nigga, this is New York, make the wrong move
And the goons let the tool spark
 Work hard, move salt
8 Ball like pool holes, cracked like the pavement
Diesel like the gas station, trap out the basement
Blow in the Pyrex, mask on our faces
Let 'em act sketch, bet this lead will erase 'em
